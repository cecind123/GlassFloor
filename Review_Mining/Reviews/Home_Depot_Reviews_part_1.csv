bad,"Terrible call center. All about bleeding orange this and that about we're all in it together but no flexibility, horrible pay, terrible hours and shifts available. No room for upward movement unless you suck up"
bad,"Was hired for garden since my expertise is with plants, instead they would switch me to electrical without any training and expect me to answer the customer's questions, and then get upset when I cant give them anything. Promise you hours you'll never get, was working 4 hours a week after driving over an hour to get to work, management will pick on you constantly if they dont like you."
bad,Not enough staff to assist the customers and complete tasks.  People are taken from one department to fill in other departments that are short staffed.
bad,Management shows favoritism.  They also do not follow through with what they promised. Lack of communication - the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
bad,This is a job that limits any creative thinking in a person. Very strict and the benefits were almost a joke. Management offered no help and usually very understaffed.
bad,"District manager to regional on up are very untrustworthy, they fire people who play by the rules but they don’t and still have jobs , Dallas DM and Regional team and HR team are deceitful and are nice to your face and stab you in the back"
bad,"I did not enjoy my employment at Home depot, very unprofessional management and an unhealthy working environment........................................"
bad,"customers are idiots,, pick your brain,, buy parts bring 2/3 back that u then had to put away.."
bad,Managers are horrible very rude and they don’t care about their employees. They rather throw them under the bus than to loose a few dollars. The amount of money we make does not   compare to the work we do or what we have to go through.
bad,"The 3911 store is probably the worst store. Theres a huge lack of management. You'll most likely be working alone in a job that requires at least 2 people I.E online order fulfillment, lumber, gardening. I was in the online orders I highly recommend you avoid that at all costs. Even if you bust your butt getting huge orders ready there will be no consideration"
bad,"It is my hope that in the future the Crawfordsville, Indiana Home Depot will be more inclusive of diversity among their employees and stay true to the term Equal Opportunity Employer."
bad,Not a main job for you and your family depend on. Need another main job to support your family. Forget about raise even though it have been under paying job
bad,"The pay is terrible & management is a joke! Seriously, They rather give a promotion to somebody within the company who's less than qualified than find someone who is from the outside. When they made this lady who has horrible customer service the new merchandising supervisor (sept of 2018)half the team quit(including myself). The job itself was ok but getting disrespected on a daily an over worked wasnt worth it. & when i brought this to her bosses attention (along with other co-workers) nothing was done about it NOTHING, worse job ive ever had.& btw i dont see this store lasting the store manager was the only thing keeping this store afloat but guess what he was on temp leave an hasnt been back since! its been a year LOL!!"
bad,"Did a wonderful job during my tenor with the company. However Management does not support hardworking employees,  they let them go, and keep the laziest most toxic staff on board. The cashiers are some of the most backstabbing,  immature individuals I have ever worked with!"
bad,"Underpay workers, barely any full time positions. The managers don’t work as a team or cate to try. Benefits are terrible, most people can’t afford them."
bad,Most of my co-workers who knew me used to call me the whipping boy. i left because every time I had a bad sales month two managers would pull me in a little office and rip me a new one
bad,"Started out as a great job but had massive expectations after awhile. Management was horrid, and you get write ups constantly till you are fired. Even if you work non-stop, unless you meet their expectations, you'll soon be out of a job"
bad,"Got a 25 cent raise per hr"
bad,Very tumultuous place to work very demanding inconsistent schedules disrespectful mod’s the orange promises only apply to customers sometimes not employees ever
bad,I enjoyed the job but did not like the favoritism going on within the company. If promotions were based of work and not just favoritism would've been there longer
bad,Their management sucks. They get new management every year. HR sucks on making schedules. Their pay is not worth it. Employees and management mess around with one another. Employees also mess around with other employees husband and wives.
bad,Worst experience ever. After 9 years i could never get promoted due to favoritism and subordination. I used to watch people get promoted after one year of hiring. I see people with no customer service skills get rewards just because they are the managers friends
bad,"Biased and hostile work environment"
bad,The 119th Olathe store during my time there was an absolute mess. Upper management often steps on toes and creates hostility between crew. Very poorly operated when it came to ordering stock as well.
bad,"I found that most of the managers and supervisors had no idea how to be an effective and fair leader. The person in charge of H.R. was grossly incompetent, and was practically an infant, with no managerial skills or knowledge of employee rights or regulations. I dislike any company that is constantly trying to drill into your head that Worker's Unions are evil. That is why I quit!"
bad,"I was a receiving associate for 3 years and was recently terminated for alleged violation of a safety policy.  Four pallets of fertilizer were in outside garden area waiting for a buy back pick up from the vendor. I on shift by myself when management informed that the trucking company picking up the fertilizer would be there very soon. The last pallet was leaking fertilizer from a torn bag on the bottom of the pallet.  I pulled the pallet into receiving, lifted it to chest level and placed a bag patch on the torn bag to prevent further loss of a hazardous material. Management told me that I should have let all the fertilizer, a substance classed as a hazardous material, leak out onto the floor. What I did is not even listed as a safety violation; if I had lifted the pallet over head high and walked under it, then that would have in fact been a safety violation. I was recently on short term disability for 60 days due to a personal health issue, I was on intermittent FMLA to take care of my elderly father and had been very vocal about the many problems with the freight handling situation for the last year and a half. I was back to work for only two weeks from my medical leave of absence when I was fired. I firmly believe that I was fired as retaliation for my LOA and for being very vocal pointing out the safety issues created by the freight system and the freight team.  "
bad,"Promised full time , advancement, training, teamwork. Received 15-24 hours a week, left alone with other employees in the department with no supervision or instruction. Some chose to play on their phone, I cleaned. Requested more hours and more responsibility, upset the woman who makes the schedule, hours cut even more.  Training done all online. Hard to stay motivated or feel part of something when you train all alone. Managers hide in their office to not have to deal. No one answers their phone yet all are required to have one. Such a disappointment and waste of time."
bad,They don't care about the employees . Good workers get taken advantage of. There is no accountability They are only concerned about the bottom line so employees and customers are the ones who suffer
bad,Working at Home Depot starts off as fun until you get promoted then the problem starts the only people that really gets paid is the managers or the DM I don’t mean ASM I mean SM the company is set up so that only those get large bonus they work 40 hours or less go on a lot of trips then you have to make an impossible sales plan so that you get no bonus while the company on a whole is profiting just look at the stock prices
bad,Home Depot has the unfortunate habit of over hiring for seasonal work. Management was not very organized and there were multiple employees not having an idea of what to do to stay busy on a given day. Often you would show up for work and be sent home after two hours because they had too many people working. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers.
bad,Let go for working hard. 2-3 co-workers jobs at a time.manager disrespected me and threatened my job.  Safety issues not adhered by management. Business issues not listened to.  Problems with co-workers not believed.  Pass me up for promotions to unqualified people.
bad,"The workers there have a ""do enough to say you did some work but don't do too much too fast because they'll expect it everyday"" attitude, even with all the Micro managing. The favorite employees still do less work & get big praise."
bad,"Hostile work environment."
bad,"Minimum wage job. Very little opportunity for advancement. Supervisors make few dollars more but are expected to work extra time, skip breaks, work 'clopens' - close store working until 10:00 or 11:00 PM, open the next morning at 6:00 or 7:00 AM. One carrot offered to full time employee's is profit sharing, last year for the store at which I work it was less than $3000 shared among 100 people."
bad,Work 80 hours a week. I worked 28 straight days but my store manager left early every day! No appreciation for anything you do. Store managers take credit for your good work and blame you for their bad work. WORST job ever!!
bad,"The company alone is a Nightmare. No matter where you go , north , south , East , west , the way the treat their customers is horrible. The managers aren’t doing a great job at keeping their employees or their customers."
bad,First two weeks you think it’s fine whichever you’re into it you realize the lies just keep flowing in management is only worried about themselves and then move into another position of corporation as a whole matter what they say could care less about their employees. The only thing they care about is their stockholders and their bonus program “success sharing “ JOKE! “Wheel of values” JOKE!
bad,The Home Depot is a company that is always trying to comply but not functional Customer Service is the last thing on the list.There is no seniority or appreciation that goes on within the company. It’s more like a fake it till you make it attitude.They do more firing so they can hire and fire again.
bad,I enjoy working at the warehouse off of Fairbanks but the store off of Highway six on the southwest side management sucks same work sucks pay sucksToo much favoritism going on in that store
bad,"Turns out it was politics and middle aged high schoolers. Favoritism galore, if you’re not an associate for 6years minimum good luck. Department heads don’t contribute, management never does anything and customers get told thank you for treating you like garbage."
bad,Head Cashier is terrible. Screams about not getting enough credit card applications at self-checkout. Possibly other locations not as bad ad Lockport.
bad,"No resources to get your job finished to their expectations. Management plays favorites. No hope for a raise, pay is not promising. Hated coming to work."
bad,"The morale in this place is horrendous. After being employed for 3 1/2 months, I'm disgusted by a condescending supervisor, and co-workers who have nothing better to do with their lives other than to be in other peoples' business. I can't wait to find a new job."
bad,"The managers here don't care enough if you are sick or not. They'll make you come into work even if you couldn't get out of bed. "
bad,"I will be there for 2 years in a few months, always understaffed, Managers do not care like they say they do. A Lot of favoritism, not that great of benefits, always overworked and way underpaid, I am making minimum wage as all the new hires now  that walk in through the door off the streets. I know I'm way worth more then minimum wage. They do not pay everyone accordingly to their experiences, which is not right"
bad,Dont work here.   They take advantage of you.  U never have the same schedule.  And you're not important to them.  They will fire you...and make up a reason for it.
bad,"I worked there for three years. I had a female supervisor harass me. I told management about it, and they brushed it aside. They didn’t appreciate anything that I did. They treated me differently because I was able to get my work done and called it “performance abuse”. I was suppose to become a supervisor but that never happened. They only good thing is that the made food occasionally."
bad,Managers are horrible... they encourage people who don't work... while over working and reprimanding the people who do... most days they sit in the office and hide from customers...
bad,"rude shoppers"
bad,"I worked at the distribution center on fallbrook, and if I went to heli, it'd take me a week to realize I wasn't at work. The pay wasn't good, coworkers were unhelpful, and management was the worst I've ever been around. The schedule was the only decent thing. Have fun."
bad,Horrible place to work. Do yourself a favor and dont do it! Management is horrible and the pay is worse. They also do not care about safety. They only care about money.
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for. You will never get flexible hours without a doctor's note, you have to ask off at least a month in advance if you want any time off, people never do their work unless management gives them a kick in the butt, and you're expected to rip the public off by selling credit cards that will put the customer in debt for years."
bad,During my short time at Home Depot I found they made many promises but kept very few of them. I lost money often due to poor installs which would be fine if I did any of the work and was responsible for the mistakes. Unfortunately the sales man suffers for the mistakes of the builders.
bad,It suck so bad I got hit by the employees back in the breake room and I told my store manager and she did not do anything and I reported that to corporate and they did not do anything
bad,I have heard a lot of people say good things about home depot and i know some people who have made careers of working for the company. unfortunatly the store i worked at let the department supervisors get away with anything and expected the other employees to adjust there life around what is best for the store rather than what is best for the employee.
bad,I worked for the company for almost a year before they fired me. The company alone is a place where they pick and choose what and who they want to keep and what they want to put blame on they don't take responsibility for anything they don't take care of their people so if your not willing to kiss butt or be their puppet then they will make up reasons to fire you so they can make themselves look good. M Not
bad,The managers didn’t do their jobs well I would have an hour left on my shift and they would drop a project that would make me stay late to finish also our training videos told us that if there was a dispute between associates we should tell management I told management and they told me to talk to the associate I had issues with lastly the scheduling was poor we either had to many associates on slow days or too few on busy days
bad,"Terrible company to work for, low pay, terrible hours, horrible management! In the end, gave my two weeks notice, was fired day before my last day. I had never been written up in all my years of working there. Manager said I destroyed property, but wouldn't show me proof?!"
bad,I was a Brand Ambassador thru 3rd party company's I did not work directly for Home Depot but I do have clearance to work for Home Depot if necessary   .
bad,Underpaid and overworked with no time off. Ever. The cashiers were paid more than me and I had managerial responsibilities. Often criticized for making mistakes completing tasks that I was not properly trained to dohandle
bad,they will hire you and promote the people with no product knowledge and no the people with product knowledge after ten years with the company over the age of 40 homedepot looks for a way to get rid of you like 3 write ups in one night
bad,Terrible management that cant keep anything together. Extremely hostile environment towards associates. Management needs to change from the top in order to see some kind of change at this place. Benefits are mediocre and the pay if bellow average for associates. Hours are terribly scheduled.
bad,Don't care about their employees. They set the goals so high now the bonuses are nothing for a million dollar store. Greedy corporate. Our last check was 52.00. For busting your butt and making them millions. The front of the store are the one's that ring up those millions. In one week rang up over 500 customers
bad,Don’t work here. Absolutely corrupt company. They’re very condescending and have no respect for your actual life.the management sucks and will do anything to make your life miserable. This place is not recommended and the people that push carts make more money then the people that operate the heavy machinery. Absolutely corrupt
bad,"Very poor leadership in the store from department heads, assistant managers and store manager. They are replacing skilled knowledgeable people with younger people that have no practical or hands on construction experience."
bad,overworked and underpaid and never promote from within and have adegree of favortism and high turnover. Not the best place to have a career and no room for growth
bad,"Thet Treat people unfairly"
bad,Do not report to HR or you will get fired also for something if you dont clarify it clearly. There is a lot of inappropriate harassment in the work place so be careful. I was not willing to stay I  the conditions
bad,"There is a glass ceiling for CSR. They are also underpaying for the job duties. Everything is focused on numbers and the managers in the building show it. By the way, Home Depot has the worst customers in the world."
bad,They expect you to be trained in several other depts including the dept you were hired for..No loyalty to their staff Dont encourage staff relationships
bad,This is a retail job. They will pay you minimum wage. The only pro's to working here is that they give you an option for an hour lunch and also contribute to a 401k.
bad,"I have given my all into This job, and I have worked day after day. It is unorganized, messy, and not supportive. Management is very uptight an mean non supportive an mean."
bad,"They will make you work every Holliday n weekend. Unless your brown nose your butt off.  Also theres no reason why employees cant have a set schedule. Its all about power and controlling you. Also, being a slave to your job."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at the Hampton Virginia Home Depot. Their management team is very bias and racially motivated to placement of people being promoted. Very sneaky and will try to get rid of you if they do not like you or you don't fit their in their agenda. Most associates fear for their jobs so they will not say or report management to main office , because store management will retaliate."
bad,This is a wonderful company and unfortunately there are many people that work at the location that I am in that are rude have no respect for their coworkers and they treat customers very horrible. Managers do not hold associates accountable for their wrong doings a lot of rules and regulations are broken every day and this makes me feel very upset and sad that a lot of these people take advantage and take value away from the Home Depot Brand.
bad,"As much money as the company makes, they need to pay employees more, Supervisors sleep With their associates, Management sucks. You have people that have worked at the company for 20 years plus who act like supervisors delegating other associates to specific tasks, A LOT OF FAVORTISM! Over all I would never recommend this job to anyone. If you like busting your behind for low pay then Home Depot is for you"
bad,"Working at the Home Depot has taught me a lot especially dealing with the public. I have met some of the most amazing staff members, as well as managers. "
bad,Wasn't too fond of this job. The work was a bit difficult and the pay wasn't too great either. Management on the other hand was the worst and I would not work there again.
bad,Horrible place to work for. Expect load of work and nothing in return. Store manager cares less about employees but rather see her to do better. Lack of knowledge
bad,The pay is horrible and they never schedule enough ppl to work. The management dont help employees when they need help. To many wanna b bosses under the same building at once all the time telling you different things to do.
bad,I got hurt twice while working here and nobody storewide nor corporate-wide would take care of me I now suffer from neck spasms and weakness in my left arm on top of back pain as a result to a herniated disc in my neck and my lower back. I was not compensated for the injuries I sustained I had to take a month off without pay and the pay really isn't all that great for the amount of work I was doing. Management would rather harass me then help me
bad,"Rosenberg location is the worst.  Bad management, dangerous workplace, and ridiculous schedule.  Do yourself a favor, unless you want a workplace injury, no days off, or blatant disrespect by superiors, look elsewhere."
bad,This company has become one of the most unethical companies in the service industry. The leadership is extremely unprofessional and treats employees poorly. The organization pretends to have a human resources department in name only. They used to really care about people and be approachable but not any more. About 2 years ago our stores got a new Regional HR director who only cares about employee survey scores. she know that the store and district managers falsify the surveys taking them anonymously pretending to be employees to offset the real concerns. they have an employee relations manager who's job is to protect the senior leaders and hide information. I
bad,"Management were unfair to myself and others. I shouldn’t had to be force to sue the company due to termination while hospitalized. "
bad,managers were horrible and evil.I hated working here because of that reason they made me feel uncomfortable and i was treated unfairly i would not recommend working at that specific location. Coursey blvd location.
bad,"Wouldn’t ever do it again. Only cared about the customers, would make you look stupid in front of a customers, coworkers thrives on drama, wouldn’t recommend 0/10"
bad,Too many expectations and not enough support to perform duties. Stores are always understaffed and departments are run by people that don't understand the products they sell.
bad,Extremely dirty. Terrible place.  There computers are slow.  Equipment old and dirty.  Parking lot is dangerous.  Trash everywhere .   Security guards needed.
bad,"I worked as a head cashier and no matter how hard you worked at your job they made you feel like it wasn’t good enough.  Other employees were not supportive in anything, they were more concerned where they were going to be in the shift and when their breaks and lunches were. Overall the only thing I liked about my job while I was there was interacting with the customers."
bad,"A TYPICAL DAY AT WORK "
bad,"I worked there for four years and yes I moved up in the company but was ignored for my actual devotion to the company. I was threatened and mentally abused by a direct manager and when I went to report the situations the report would ""magically"" disappear and the manager would never be reprimanded. In order to get away from the harassment I had to move to a different dept. I was worked up so badly that I could lose my job at any moment if I did one thing wrong that I developed IBS and stress rashes."
bad,The job began good enough the quickly turned horrible. My fellow workers acted more like teenagers in high school than adults. Every unprofessional when it came to adult situations. Which management did nothing to curb. So I found a new job as soon as could! Every uncomfortable and unprofessional environment to work
bad,"Not the most loyal company out there, and the managers where I worked all had terrible attitudes. There were few employees that earned my respect there"
bad,Home Depot is an at will employer. Their priorities are company first. Employees last. The customers satisfaction is a negotiable factor. It seems they have difficulty with answering phones. To save money they terminate employees before their vacation time can be in effect. Usually one year of hire date. Same for sick or accumulated hours. They do not pay for any time you have accured.
bad,I resigned because the constant hostile from management . I do not recommend this place to work to anybody unless you want to be treated like trash. I stayed that long because I always thought it will get better..
bad,"Underpaid and overworked"
bad,"Everything received 1 star. There are a few areas that would have not even received that. "
bad,"New middle management is a horrible manager. He made mistakes and when sales declined, he threw his subordinates the blame. Poor management at the Jasper In office. Theres more, just trust that you do not want to explore working here as more than a temp job between real jobs."
bad,"You are required to work 6 days a week & most of the time you get zero days off!! You are commission only but w2.Your paycheck depends on the attitude of the project manager & if she doesn't like you, you will go months without pay!!! If you file a formal complaint, you will get fired!"
bad,The managers and supervisors suck they act like people don’t have their own lives outside of Home Depot they say it’s a team but it’s really not they pick and choose who they want to put with u if they know yo potential
bad,"It is what it is .  Most of the co workers  resented  designers  for having a ""desk"" job .   They were very unsupportive ,  until it came time for their bonuses ,  which we earned for them ,  but never got to take part in."
bad,la empresa es genial pero los líderes son una basura incluyendo RH
bad,"Customers very rude and entitled "
bad,"Terrible pay bad management."
bad,"Worst job place ever.managemrnt sucked, low on staff no hours. Struggle to get a day off. Winter time you get no hours but they keep hiring more people, even if you ask for more hours you will not get it"
bad,The company is racist. The employees attack white people because they don't want them to get promoted. I would never recommend them to anyone. The managers sleep with the associates while on duty. It was a disgusting place to work.
bad,"There is no work and personal life balance, it’s all work and if you request time off just know when your next schedule comes out you’re going to work like a dog!"
bad,no increase in pay rate they have a high turnover rate your starting pay is 12.50 and the company blames the employees for a lost after inventory not fair
bad,"Stand in one spot for 9 hours without a break.  Throw you to the wolves after watching a few online videos. Forget about you, will not relieve you for breaks."
bad,They use you they don't  work with you they never tell you how good you are working they put you in hard work spot with no help and then they fire you for no reason
bad,I have never been so poorly treated or paid in fourty years !!! IT is highly abusive and populated with substance abusers that assume everyone is an addict
bad,Hired to work a specific department but spent all of my time servicing customers all over the store. Then would get talked to by supervisor about how sales in the department I worked for were down and would have to increase. You can't have it both ways. Service customers or service department.
bad,"Por parte de RH es un pésimo trato así como de gerencia y supuestos líderes de área de lo peor "
bad,New Management and new HR are terrible they do not recognize the people that work hard for them stay away from this place until they get a better store manager
bad,"If your looking to pay your bills or mortgage this is not the place for you. "
bad,"Dont work there. I was awesome employee. They dont care. There not family at all. No no no. "
bad,Patience and kindness is a virtue. Do your best to watch your mouth. Performance sales need to be kept up even as cashier. Try your best to stay safe. Injuries can cause turmoil with management.
bad,"They treated you terribly and expect you to do everything the staff constantly quit so we had to get new ones all the time. Management was a joke and didn’t care how hard you work, you could be breaking a sweat the whole time but the moment you sit down on down time from being tired they would get on you. The ratio would be 5 customers or more per each employee"
bad,Unless you want to work for management that dont believe in you having time off or even seeing your family this is the perfect job for you. Once you become salary it has been a horrible place to work
bad,I was the Inventory control lead at Interlinebrands/Homedepot and the management did not know how to conduct themselves around warehouse associates they thought that they were above all employees and talked down to them and I have evidence on all of the management at the levittown location if you would like to know more contact me
bad,"Worked at home depot for 11 years."
bad,I hated working for this company.Racist people are always late.Management would tell you lies about becoming full time.I work at the laurel Home Depot in Maryland worst.
bad,"THD was one of the strangest places I have ever worked.  The culture if you can call it that is an upside down pyramid of yes men, most of which will think nothing about cutting your throat to attain that next run on the boringly bourgeois orange ladder.  THD, it is really hard to tout diversity when that appeared to be a common thread of all that worked there.  The corporate clan in Atlanta are just straight up liars so take nothing at face value."
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They do not care about their associates. Over all Home Depot is a terrible company to work for. Don’t work for Home Depot
bad,"As a cashier at The Home Depot, you had to stand behind the register and wait for customers. Customers there are usually men and as a female working there, it was really uncomfortable."
bad,Basically this is a very easy job to the point of not needing even a grade 9 education! Beware there is no room for advancement and NO raises for anything as there is not much to learn here!Very boring .. a lot of just making work for yourself by reprinting labels and washing the same spot over and over again. Management is demeaning and requires you to ask permission from her ... to then ask to request days off through the scheduler for medical tests ???if you only made it to grade 9 this is the job for you but if you have any post secondary do yourself a favour and decline the offer there is absolutely no growth in a merchandising position with Home Depot!
bad,Poor managment and lack of communication leading to shceduling issues and just tension between employees. No one wanted to work and major call off issues.
bad,Only work here if you need a job. The job takes good people and makes them miserable. 3 months after working there I noticed myself losing joy no matter how hard I worked
bad,"Branch sales manager and sales managers do nothing but forward emails "
bad,"Hours are inconsistent at best  one week you can work 6 hours and the next you may work 20  No formal training except being harassed to watch endless videos which you’ll get yelled at if not done within certain time"
bad,"I learned a lot at the HD, really got to sharpen my skills, made friends that today are like family, unfortunately management is lacking, it's a click"
bad,"Management belittles you if asking questions or asking for help. I realize we all have jobs to do, but we're on the same team ffs. Many employees have never seen a hammer and nails, let alone used them, but feel the need to interject with their little comments. Don't work here, management is terrible. I won't even shop at home Depot, my hard earned money doesn't deserve to go into their hands. Pay is so low it's almost not worth it to show up, no breaks no lunch, just unreal expectations"
bad,The work that I did was not very hard and I got along really good with all of my co-workers everybody would help out anytime you needed help but management was no good and my particular management was sexist it was run by a woman and she would only promote women so if you're a male stay away you will have no future there
bad,"Trust no one!  They act like your friend and stab you in the back.   It’s a lot like kindergarten.  If you’re a slacker that sucks up to management, you should do fine."
bad,"Company used to care for the people. Those who worked for them and those who did not. No longer a place of knowledgeable employees due to lack in pay, benefits and advancements. Management to stressed out to leave their offices and deal with customers and employees."
bad,They pushed you do something that was in your department to do. They didn’t care about you if you got hurt they didn’t care one bit about. They only cared about the money.
bad,I worked at home depot for 7 years and was never promoted and they often hired managers from outside the company. Management had their favorites and still didn't promote them as well.
bad,"I have interview 3 times at the home depot near mira costa."
bad,working over at home depot ok no good pay rate even they ask you to cut hours when you are a full time associate management not fair. not a good environment to work at
bad,"Poor management  & unfair after workers comp claim. Can’t wait to be rid of you after a worker’s comp claim. Don’t want you to be a liability. Some of the supervisors & management lie. I really enjoyed some of the staff & manyof the customers, but I felt I was treated unfairly."
bad,Moral is not great due to lack if hours and departments being short handed. Management is strict on policy when it suits them only. Mistakes are rampant and blame is often placed incorrectly.
bad,"To much work for to little pay and the managers are rude & inconsiderate. How can people live on $12 hourly pay and especially when they cut my hours because the store was making no money make my life so much harder. I’m in school & a single mom & I ask for a raise but they will not give me it & I have been there for 2years. It’s not that I want the raise, I need it."
bad,"I left Home Depot because of the culture. The management staff take advantage. The pay is not worth the aggravation with dealing with upper management. Management does not support the ssles floor in the decisions that they make with the customers. There were safety concerns as well, which they did not want to address at all"
bad,If you're not a part of their (management) inner circle or kissing the store managers behind you're a target each day you go to work. Everyone knows everyone else personal business. Just watch the company you keep. O and let's not forget about corporate.....when complain about managers.....you get FIRED. NO LIE
bad,Dont work here. Its terrible management is awful everyone is a bunch of grown bullies acting as if they are in high school they all need to grow up run the other way
bad,Dishonest associates and dishonest managers dishonest HR --they tend to take advantage of wantable associates. Also associates are you desperate higher positions and they are willing to fight The playdate for.
bad,homedepot is the worst company I ever worked for in my life .their pay is about 20 years behind .I operated a fork lift 20 years ag for more than $13.00  they expect an experienced driver to do this for $11.00 an hour .that is rediculess.their  profit shareing is a joke the only ones that benefit  good from it is upper management the lower employees get a very small amount every 6 months maybe .their start pay is a joke as is their yearly raises .they have a backside kissing problem in some stores if you don't kiss up you get nowhere if you work hard they do everything they can to get rid of you.i personally wouldn't recommend any one to work for them unless you are a good back side kisser.customers on the most part are great but the service they get most sucks .if they need something they get a finger point to where it is they need .there is a slight few associates that will walk them to where they need to go .and very few that spend time helping the customer.that is bad customer service.home depot safety first and customer first is very wrong .all homedepot cares about is money and screwing their small amployees.these are a fact from experience of working for them.HOMEDEPOT IS A BIG DISAPOINTMENT FOR A BUISSNESS.
bad,"Unless you want to be a monkey at a typewritter  this company is not for you.  For years I thought I bleed Orange.  Sadly when I was promised time off when I needed it to be it was declined at the last minute which would have made me lose my flight costs.   Yet other associates who were travelling overseas could do it no problem.  But mine be domestic was blocked.  Sniffs of reverse discrimination to me."
bad,Home Depot is one of the worst company to work for. They do not care for their employees and family life. Infact I think they hate when you have a family.
bad,"I would not go back to work for home depot if my life depended on it. The company only gives raises every 12 months. They try and tell you its cause you get an annual bonus but thats if the store makes its magical sales number. If you are a motivated hard worker, they wont compensate you, they will abuse you"
bad,"The job was okay, the best part of it was the coworkers who kept me laughing, though in all honestly working in retail can expose one to how childish grown adults can act."
bad,due to store manager and ops manager change the store became less fun to work at. over night staff was short handed for months with no new recruits brought in and presents unrealistic goals in a demanding way for the few employees that where left
bad,working for this company reminds you how evil the world is. It really a shame how so much goes on there and only the workers suffer behind it. the management is full of favoritism an will easy throw a rock and hide their hand. i would not recommend my worse enemy to work their.
bad,En la tienda de Bernardo Quintana en Querétaro el gerente es una persona muy.  Negativa y muy mal elemento
bad,"Working for home Depot was the worst ."
bad,"The system is jacked, points don’t fall off, you get raises every 3 years, the management shows favoritism and picks. No one cares in there. My yearly review (for a raise) never mentioned anything about the things that I’ve actually done. Picked the one time I do something to determine my raise. Not to mention they have NO ppl of color as supervisors. They want you to do work they don’t pay you for."
bad,"Horrible to their employees, horrible to their customers. No one should be working here. They are unfair, unreasonable, allows their employees to be harassed and be discriminated against."
bad,They let me go based on allegations not facts or truth. There understaffed they take forever to train you the staff is rude to employees there very biased they’ll act like they wanna be friends but will y’all bout you behind your back.
bad,this job is not something i would recommend to anyone trying to make a career out of it. i didn't enjoy coming to work nor was there much room to progress.
bad,Dont ever get sick.  Not enough sick time earned for any person.  Policy explained one way but enforced a different way.   Favoritism.  Miss regular customers.
bad,it be stressful due to having to hurry because the departments were always short on staff and they were always messing around with the schedule when they say they will work with your class schedule .
bad,The management was not good. They where not good with people going to school and working at the same time. Very bad scheduling and no not appreciate employees.
bad,"Expectations to stock, maintain cleanliness, inventory and ordering plus try to wait on customers was way to much to handle. could not give customers good service because of setting end caps and trying to move inventory"
bad,"the manegment that  was there was not involved the staf wassome waht rude lot of work and no time to brake no organasation of the store or products, and system"
bad,"Management makes up ""new"" rules every month. Lie and make it what they want, not what it actually says. Follow you around to get dirt on you. Ask coworkers about conversations you have. Always looking for a reason to screw with hourly employees. Give you a 50 cent raise and act like it's a million dollars. Told me I could do whatever I wanted, just not in front of customers.Then they fired me after starting a ""secret"" investigation. Angry hostile HR guy wanted me to create a document that matched their ""secret"" document. I asked him if they wanted to go through my phone and talk to my friends and customers to get more dirt on me. Somehow hostile HR guy didn't like that. Fired me for something written down by someone else. I couldn't see it but needed to throw myself under the bus???? Stay away from here."
bad,"Low pay, no real benefits, very physical work, stressful workload, inflexibility on schedules.  Few breaks are allowed.  Customers are extremely demanding, inventory counts are incorrect on their app, the pressure to sell customer other options. The pressure to sell credit card, but don't disclose the 27% APR."
bad,"Sadly for me, this was my first job and worst experience that lasted way under a month. I originally applied to be with freight but upon interview, the one manager asked me to be with garden instead. I agreed to do any work as I needed the money and a job. Sadly, my entire time spent I was never out on the sales floor and was stuck in the back room every shift redoing training on a computer for hours because they messed up my training 3 times in a row and couldn't give me a valid reason as to why. I ended up leaving and relocating to work in a better state."
bad,Most people there coworkers are on drugs or doing drugs in the bathrooms or parking lots outside very poor management dirty bathrooms dirty parking lots with alot of homeless people there walking around on drugs going through garbage cans trash all over the parking lots very little hours and pay they give you very disrespectful customers and co workers
bad,"I've worked as loss prevention in a few different environments and this was the worst."
bad,"I never "
bad,"After being told the transfer was completed, I stopped part of the way to Idaho Falls and called the manager, I was then told that they didn't have any full time jobs available. I have since pulled up home depot Idaho Falls and they have an opportunity to be a DH."
bad,As an employee for almost 2 years I only make $11.33 an hour. Management are never there when help is needed. I've been told several times when I've asked for help that the only difference between the management and I is $50 difference what we can give to the customers if there's an issue. They told me I have the knowledge deal with the issue. Wish I could say something more positive.
bad,Very poor leadership from  Corp level  . Store manager in our  building Is constantly on her personal phone checking tinder  and hanging out in back .
bad,At the home depot I was not chalenged to do better. To male things worse they did not seem to value hard work when it came to promotions. They Only move people up if they are a minority or a woman. That is not based on work.
bad,If you want to work for a company whos managers hide behind there employees talents cause they are always in the office hiding and there key holders run there stores come work for these guys.
bad,"I have worked for the home depot for almost 4 years now and as I should be making more then starting employees I make the same as a new employee. My pay increases were leveled with no explanations. There is also little room for advancements. Not only this but they hire many people and cut hours. I have only worked there part time,  but even with my little hours they were still cutting my hours sometimes even down to 4 hours a week. Terrible company to work for, unless your young and this is your first job."
bad,I work there for 14 it is a very stressful place to fork for the pay dose not reflect the difficulty of the work. Don’t work for this company it dose not have you’re best interest at hart. If you do work for this company beware of management there not there to help you but make you work double if you are a go getter
bad,They do not pay equivalent to the workload and type to work required.  More important that management get their bonuses than to focus on the customer or the employee well being.
bad,"Pretty bad. the people there were not nice, you were asked to do things that acquired certain equipment without the equipment, management was poor, when I asked for help in training they did not train me, took them three months just to train me on a electric ladder, the DS yelled at me and everyone all the time, just a bad place to work for."
bad,"They suck and will not work around your availability even when you have school. Advancement is rare and they'll only pick who they like as people and not as good, reliable employees."
bad,"The hours provided would randomly change from 4 to 7 to anything in between. The physical work was demanding, the work culture was not positive and you were taken advantage of by older employees 'teaching' you as to get you to do all the work even though they were same level employee as you."
bad,"Company has really cut back on work force. Alot more expected out of employees with minimum wages. Awards have almost all gone. Example Homer awards, Allstore awards, employees pay for barbaques now, Christmas parties."
bad,Store #6584 has the worst management ever. Would recommend working at any other Home Depot where they are appreciative of having you work there. Would always give me a hard time especially for being less than 5mins late due to me having to drive from Kingsville Tx to Corpus Christi Tx.
bad,The district i work in ptomotes their friends over others and hire people on for the same amount they are paying people who have been there for years.
bad,Management are rude and they do not listen to their employees. They do not give any kind of safety gear to employees exposed to heavy duty tasks. Poor customer service.
bad,The pay is a joke. They mess with your schedule on days off never the same. You may work 8 to 9 days straight with out a day off. The management is total joke.
bad,"Working at Home Depot was not how they made it out to be in the interview. I got the job when I was pregnant and they knew I was pregnant and they didn't really care if I was having issues standing them long hours, no one really trained me. I was always so lost there and I just really wouldn't recommend working at the location I was at. Hopefully they're not all so rude like that one."
bad,"Team was great to work with, but management struggled.  Part time employees were either working 40 hours one week and 8 hours the next.  There was no consistency with schedules and schedules would not be completed until the day before the shift started."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend to anyone. They are very lazy, and the management team isn't helpful at all. Home Depot prides themselves on family values, but not there."
bad,Sucks dirty employees don’t wanna help anyone district managers are shady and inconsistent show  fake empathy wish people care more about you... there is no work life balance
bad,"I haven’t had a lot of jobs but what I’ve learned is this one is what I never want from a company again."
bad,"Alot of your superiors and gm and your om on outbound in your Salem rdc is combative rude , and they just dont seem to care about what you have going on in your personal life they threaten  their employees for using there sick time among playing favorites"
bad,If this is a temporary or a part time job then it's perfect. But if you're in it to move up through the ranks then be prepared to be there forever. They find any reason to fire you.
bad,"The company itself does not treat people like humans. The management plays favorites and seems to not understand or respect that they shouldn’t be romantically involved with employees, making favoritism worse. Management with throw you all around and not respect your job title. They will put you in departments that you’ve never worked by yourself with no training or experience. The store manager himself has laughed in not only mine but my other associates faces when we’ve went to him with problems. They don’t address unprofessional behavior. They only apply policies to people when they feel like it. They sometimes will only give part time employees 6 hours a week just because they can. The store manager wants to look better so he makes hours super scarce for people and won’t even give them a heads up about cutting their hours. The drama is ridiculous and they never hold people accountable. I have told management about the supervisors being nasty and unprofessional and I was told that’s just who they are and that I was emotional. It’s a huge joke to work here. You make $11 starting off and I’ve been there 2 years and only got a 35 cent raise. The company is given money to support its employees with food and what not and the managers use it for themselves."
bad,Got sick real bad with brochites could go back to work been filling out applications to go back won't hire me even had a doctor's excuse to bring back called in and all being seeing they hiring but never once got a call from y'all must not need people that bad
bad,At first its ik but after words it gets bad they forget about you and you no longer have no support from no one you feel a lot if pressure and they put more on you as if you can handle everything. You also get hired for one job but end up doing 5 jobs at a time so the pay you get doesnt do for what your working.  They take complete advantage of you. And they always say that they are a big family. Yeah sure if you play by their rules and do everything they ask.
bad,"If you enjoy being in the military, you’ll love working for the Home Depot. If you need ROTC training as a college student, this job is for you. I was employed by HD for 3 years and never met an employee that was happy with their job."
bad,"Was having health problems.  Received snarky comments from the MOD's."
bad,"If your not sleeping with management, you won't get promoted. Its like working at a highschool. They are unfair and the pay is some doo doo. Do not work here."
bad,"Terrible place to work , pays very badly, and management very bad , company absolutely no carrier about workers, you can work very hard, and company can fired you just because management no like you."
bad,"Do not take care of associates. If you are not liked, you will not promote. If you are not a person who is a do as I say, and not do your best you will not go anywhere.."
bad,with budget cuts at every corner there are constantly less and less employees in the store and always more work to be done buy less people for the same money
bad,The workplace is not conducive to a balanced life and work. I did not receive the appropriate training to help me become a successful employee and team member.
bad,"I worked at the Leesburg, FL. store for more than two years on the MET.  I kept hoping for things to change but it was a waste of time. Some people do nothing,while others like me had to do all the work. I couldn't ask for a day off or leave early,even though I had the time. They always threaten to fire their employees. If you are Hispanic or Black there is a lot of racism at the Leesburg store."
bad,"I would never recommend this company. They ask you to do more than what you job description is. Supervisor was no ever available to help out his front end or head cashiers, assistant manger was to worried about his numbers to care about anything on his front end, you work under constant duress."
bad,not a good place to work unless you like being verbally abused. management will berate you and accuse of things you didn't do and then fire you. they will also retailiate against you if you tell them there is a problem somewhere in the store.
bad,"Heavy manual labor boxes from 1lbs to 150lbs that u have to lift, you have to be fast or you get fired, they dont care about you. The warehouse manager dont care about you and fires people for stupid stuff to make him feel like a better person but we all know what he really is."
bad,Work ethic doesn't matter the only thing that did was who you knew. You wind up in a never ending loop of lies and not able to promote in store unless you brown nose your way up.
bad,"Home depot has to be the worse place I have ever worked.  There are tons on work relationships going on that just add to the drama. The management is not understanding at all of outside life. You basically have to eat, breath, and sleep Home Depot to make it anywhere in the store.They do not care about there employees in the last month I was there 24 people had quit. They have one of the largest turn over rates. And forget about raises, you work a whole year of your life for a small .40 cents. Just look at all options before working here."
bad,Go to another store Vicksburg Homedepot is not being ran right. Go to Clinton or Jackson store please you will be appreciated more and probably advance quicker
bad,"this place is absolutely terrible to work at. the hours are terrible, the conditions are terrible and the employee turn over rate is through the roof."
bad,Its a place that show a lot of favoritism toward other employees.  They do fake promotion boards interviewing multiple people but already got in mind who they want to promote.
bad,NA SOCIALISM Businesses or Incorporated gets Robbed often by the general public. The overall company is politics and not worth the Mental damages of every day working environment.
bad,"Managment has little to no back bone, shows favoritism and are overall lazy. "
bad,This job is one job i will Never go back too. The pay was not enough and they did not like to give raises or more hours and did not care about that you had kids.
bad,"I was employed for a very reputable , successful company do over 20 years. Great salary and benefits. And they took care of their employees. Not the same with Home Depot."
bad,Do NOT work there if your a single parent if your child gets sick and you don’t have enough sick time ( which you only get 2 hours per month) your basically out of luck and they said they DO NOT care if you have doctors notes for your child.
bad,"Management sucks, there are a number of know it all coworkers, and way too much drama in the cashier department plus all you do is stand there and can't leave your spot and do anything."
bad,"The Jasper Home Depot was wonderful at first, but went down hill after a few years. Management simply does not care about its people like they say they do. It doesn't matter if you're the only one running three departments, they all three better look perfect at all times, or you'll find yourself with a write up about how you didn't do you job. Never mind that it was Saturday, filled with customers needing help and you had A LOT of call offs. Jasper Home Depot store 2025 is a joke. Management is a joke. For a company that is supposed to care about its people, and its military, this store does not care. Do NOT work here. They are not worth your time."
bad,Everyone treated the lot associates like trash. You were talked too like a child and when you stood up for yourself you were the troublemaker. No help was given doing busy times. Managers and department heads would make lot associates do things that they did not want to do.
bad,"You’re a number. That’s it. They will replace you in a minute with another minimum wage warrior and not even blink. They provide no training, a skeleton staff, and then wonder why they get poor customer service reviews."
bad,The Home Depot culture says we take care of our Associates through the inverted pyramid. They really don't they could care less about their Associates. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it
bad,"i gave home depot 11 years of my life i started out as a cart pusher because i had no clue what i wanted to do with my  life as time went on i wanted to cashier because i  knew that would lead to bigger opportunites elsewhere i had to beg plead and even offered to transfer to other home depot's because the 0413 store wouldn't let me finally in april 3 years ago i got recertified as a cashier and the second time around i was very successful i sold 26 store credit cards and as many warranties and i loved doing it, i hated pushing carts because it was so stressful i just lost my cool on too many times and that is on me but at the sametime home depot failed to work with me they knew i was happy being a cashier i thought that when i got promoted i could move on from pushing carts but nope they hire high school kids who will work for anything and aren't out of school till 3 in the afternoon if anyone read's this and are still thinking about working for home depot you have been warned"
bad,Low pay and horrible hours for amount of work required. Horrible management who doesn't train you but expects you to do major merchandising resets within a limited time frame. No teamwork thus low morale. Horrible customer service also made this job not good all around.
bad,Very poor management and loss of valuable work force due to rigid requirements that are unrealistic.  Would not recommend Home Depot as a career choice.
bad,"worst part about working at HD is the despicable  hourly scheduling.. Off one day then work 2(different start time hours) then shift in 'duties' /departments is  challenging.  I would prefer a set schedule so as to balance my home life and work. I feel I'm always being ""thrown under the bus"" despite years of excellent work reviews, the ""raise(s) don't reflect the work history and don't even keep up with the cost of living increases."
bad,"Company incurraged separation between management and employee"
bad,I had got into a car wreck they told me I could take FMLA so I did.a month later I got my vacation check in the mail I called they said they let me go because I wasn't there long enough to qualify for FMLA but my manager said I did.i worked very hard for this company in the lumber department Wich is rough by its self.not a good company
bad,I have nothing nice or negative to say about home depot they did what they did and the level of respect for management is non existent. everyone needs to view for themselves
bad,Upper management is As corrupt as the current presidential administration. There is no opportunity for growth unless you know someone. Promotion processes is just formality.
bad,You don't get paid well. Never get recognized for your hard work. Favouritism is huge and it sucks when you see the perks people get simply because they are the favourites.
bad,"Because of their goal to be #1 in customer service, Home Depot has created a customer culture that has produced spoiled and unreasonable customers.  HD expects a lot from employees but is slow to properly recognize good work and will not compensate much with an annual pay increase.  This low pay increase, approximately 2.5%, is justified with petty things that they say indicates lesser work performance than they required.  Iʻve gotten the same exact pay raise whether I do the most excellent job possible or the lowest possible performance.  In my experience, this shows that raises are not based on performance, HD simply wants to pay the least amount possible and expect maximum results of employees.  Like the products they buy at cheap wholesale prices and sell at a great mark-up retail price, employee work output are just another product that is obtained at a low price. I believe HD will not achieve their ""#1 in customer service"" goal because underpaid and unappreciated employees who have diminished morale will not allow this to happen.  Experiential evidence supports this idea. As a HD employee and HD customer, I see a great amount of dysfunctionality in every department and at every level, from the lowest paid worker all the way up to corporate level.  Go to a Home Depot and start asking questions, youʻll quickly see what I am talking about.  HD, itʻs very simple, employees are not robots, take better care of employees and employees will take better care of customers."
bad,Never receive my bonuses and when i asked about then my hours were cut. No one from hdi ro check in with and no mgr knew what was going on. Very disorangized from the mgr to the sales floor.
bad,They don’t care about their employees. The company makes 21 billion the year before. They want 100% out their employees but pay them the minimum. This company sucks.
bad,Low pay..No benefits..Sorry manager....Stay late open next day...No one there was happy...Never any help on the floor...Mad  customers all the time...All employees looking for another job.Best part was leaving the building for good!
bad,I would not recommend this company for any one who is looking for a job.  Not a place worthy of employment.  This job is for high school kids looking for party money and  to have a good time with their colleagues.
bad,"No Overtime Very little pay, Want employee to work many diff depts without compensation. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!! Cant ever get a set schedule. Absolutely NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORK FOR. After working at Home Depot, I have a full understanding of merchandise care. They sale damaged goods, lie to customers, and expect you to do the same. I won't even shop at any home depot ever again."
bad,"I was so disappointed after finally getting a job at Home Depot.  I was so excited to start and the Management was just completely disappointing.  No incentives for required credit card sales, no full time opportunity or set schedules, no store discount, no guidance for reviews, pay was minimum wage an entire year, favortism, and inconsistent enforcement of rules."
bad,"Stressful dealing with daily disrespect from staff & management & from customers who feel they're royalty because they spend money & even worse, corporate condones such behavior"
bad,"very stressful work environment very big work loads and minimum hours not enough to live , not dependable on how many hours you get a week . also the schedule is consistently being changed a day or less with no notice ."
bad,poor mangerment poor schedule manger really don't know what they doing and they have there pick in choose when come to position they over look the hard working people
bad,"This company is a joke! Unless you kiss butt and throw other associates under the bus there is no way to advance. Run like a  prison. If you aren’t liked you will not be move up. Pay sucks, you get a raise every year you work there, but it could be .01-.40 cents depending on what you score."
bad,"Everything was going great when I worked the garden center, I was offered a dollar more to switch to 3rd shift which was a horrible mistake. I found myself working in frieght team after one guy had a heart attack, soon after another employee left receiving so I found myself doing two peoples jobs. Many days I was left from 5-7 to unload the truck alone which was against company policy. After I was injured after unloading the truck I was fired even after proving a drs note"
bad,"Think a million times before applying with them. If you need a full time job, go someplace else, they won't offer it to new applicants, you're just wasting your time."
bad,The customer and contractors are the most wonderful people. Home Depot will give to the responsibility without the money. The management team will make promises that they can not make happen. If you just work and do what they ask you. You  will be there alone time
bad,"understaffed and badly managed, very low wages in exchange for slave labour. it says i need a minimum of 150 characters so here is me doing that hahahahahah"
bad,"Hands down the worst job I’ve ever had. Poor and unfair management, no training provided in order to do the job required, they expect you to run the whole department alone and then yell at you when customers get backed up because you’re the only one scheduled to work in that department. Hateful and spiteful managers who have absolutely zero management and team building skills and think the way to manage is to just yell/cuss at you   I will never ever work here again and I will never recommend it to anyone"
bad,Wouldnt recommend this for anyone its trash they dont educate their employees they are always under staffed its just trash. Upper management fake. Its honestly trash. Customers hate it for a reason. Pay is trash. Most people I worked with lived below poverty dome had 2 jobs because pay was so low.
bad,I had the worst person to train me I hated the ordeal management did not make it better for me to train. They said that they would handle it but they never did so I left less than a month of employment.
bad,They work you like a dog then tell you you're not doing enough. When corporate comes management kisses 🍑 and acts like the store is not in shambles. Then after they run it into the ground. Terrible. Favouritism. No communication.
bad,"If you enjoy working in sales and Computer Aid Designing, and improving your skill sets and advancing YOUR career, Stay Away. If you prefer employment where you just go to work, have low pay, enjoy the cheer-leading and reward patches and do not aspire to better yourself and your skills it may be a swell place to hide and not get fired for incompetency."
bad,They don’t know how to handle situations the management I’ve went to HR to give complaint about other employees disrespecting me and they did nothing about it and things escalated between me and coworkers the manager just stood by and did nothing
bad,"Management was the worst I've ever seen, no one actually cared about anything, severely under staffed, no help, constant complaining, over worked. etc."
bad,Home Depot talks a lot  yet they play favorites where some people become a managers pet and other harder working people get routinely overlooked. The Home Depot work culture started out good with the original. After they steped down it became overly corporate and everything turned into the bottom line.My personal values are family first where as Home Depot expects us to put the business first even at the expence of the family.
bad,Horrible management that would treat customers awful. Do not train for the position and will leave you for the wolves. Management would always step over the associates and would never want to provide customer assistance. Don't believe the “bonuses” they have to offer. God awful place.
bad,Management and department supervisors are in constant flux leaving employees abandoned and ill prepared.  Policies are also frequently changing.  The Home Depot has been around long enough to have figured management out.
bad,"I first worked there in 2009 it was great but then I had experienced new management and it all fell apart, go to LOWES instead better pay and managers"
bad,"Too sensitive of a company every minor bump or scrap on you is to be written up. Even a small error on the job. They expect great performance for new hires after the first month. This company was too worried about safety and not enough working. Too many safety meetings even more when there was minor incidents,   piled with incident reports and human errors. This what keeps this warehouse behind. The coaches called in often due to drinking the previous weekend badcoachs constantly called in and you could smell the alcohol in their breath"
bad,They under pay and treat their employees unfairly. 10.00 an hour to start is terrible for such a big company. This is why they have such huge attrition.
bad,The management is a joke. People walk around doing nothing. No one ever helps you. You get screamed at in front of customers. It’s bad for your mental health.
bad,Overnight team complains about unload team when they do the exact same thing but of course they are the full time pros and brown nosers so they are heard. The management team sucks especially the overnight mod. It's an extremely hot unload like a sweatshop in other countries. Peer training sucks and the designated trainers/coaches suck. Gung-ho for a company who could care less about you.
bad,"The Home Depot would not make work accommodations for me. I left after 6 years but its not right to constantly going to the HR department guy and saying, ""I can't do that."" If you work there and are disabled get a contract. Then they won't hire you. So don't waste your time. Other than that if you don't work for money it's a great place to work."
bad,The freehold Home Depot is filled with drama and no communication. One manager tells you one thing then another manger tells you something completely different. They give you a very hard time when u want to take a day off or even vacation they always decline it and make you find covers which is very difficult. All management is horrible they talk about you behind your back. They are very strict especially if you don’t smile. Customers are never happy st and there very rude and management will always yell at you if a customer is rude to you. Which makes no sense. I suggest not working here
bad,They stiff you on anything they can get away with. Terrible hours. Annual meeting was 5 AM on a Sunday. No training. Was assigned to the garden department even though I had been a builder for 30 years. They invented an infraction to get rid of a manager just a few days short of retiring with a full benefits. That's how they operate.
bad,If your looking for a fulltime position home depot is not the place. You have to work there 2 plus years just to get fulltime. I only worked 4 to 5 hours a day and my paycheck wasn't even enough to pay half my rent. This job is for kids that dont have responsibilities.
bad,"It is bad enough working in Customer Service, but HD does not care for its own. They will harass you until you either break or inevitably quit. HD will always be trash. They do not care about you, your safety, or your life in general. That is why store 105 has one of the worst employee turn over rates in Georgia. I moved here hoping to grow and expand; however, the only thing that is expanding is my desire to warn everyone about uncivilized demands and dangers of Home Depot. I may be just one person, but the further you dig the deeper you'll find yourself in the mess left behind in peoples' lives caused by Home Depot. Save yourself. Avoid all business through Home Depot. Also, beware of all ASDS or HR's there in the store. If you aren't apart of their specified clique, then don't bother wasting your time trying to adapt. They will never help you out. Home Depot will always destroy the lives of their associates in order to promote their own name and brand. Even in the training videos you'll see that it will repeatedly tell you that they only want to be the number one home improvement store in the world. And believe me, they will do anything to get there."
bad,"If you're a woman cashier, expect to be harrassed by all the men that come in."
bad,"During the two years I was working there, I never was late, missed a shift and received outstanding performance appraisals."
bad,"Don't waiste your time with this stressful place.they take pride in harassing the employees, and show no respect. Go somewhere where they appreciate you. BEWARE"
bad,you don't get paid nearly enough for the amount of work you do. all they do is use and abuse you until you've had enough and then they replace you they have no respect for the their associate
bad,"This is without question the absolute worst job Ive ever had. The mgmt was beyond incompetent, the people were soo anoying an inappropriate, and usually most work was pointless or needlessly complicated. The supervisor on my shift is the most stuck up, snooty, condescending, I've ever met. I had almost no training on how to do my job and when I asked for help he would give me attitude and get angry that I asked. If I asked for clarification on something he'd actually huff an shake his head (this was all less than 2 weeks after I started).The whole thing was like a much worse version of highschool."
bad,"I call them Despot because it's a Tyranny. They SAY the triangle is upside down, but it's not. Home Depot SUCKS. They hired me as high paid kitchen design sales person - decided they did not like me in the job after the time when they could legally demote me and then set about to force me to quit by giving me bad jobs there - and when I didn't they framed me for abandoning a spanish-speaking customer - when I don't speak spanish."
bad,"Horrible managers, no fixed schedules, low pay (if they could go lower than minimum, they would), over-sexed workers who hit on each other and the customers. Just a general hades to work there."
bad,Management was fake and side not care about the people. To clicky.If you were not a favorite then they did not talk to you and if they did talk to you you could tell they were being fake. Only one manager cared. He was always on the floor working. Not the others.
bad,"It is a minimum wage job, that treats you like a minimum wage employee. Work hard and get a .24-.36 cent raise, that you lose every year due to California's law that increases minimum wage $1 every year until it hits $15/hr."
bad,the former store manager in Vernon was awesome unfortunately the majority of other management kept him in the dark about almost everything that was happening in the store. Most of the lower management seems to have their own agenda. If you get injured on the job you are sent back to your job under what they called modified duty but you were basically left on your own to continue any job duties in your job. First aid which is mostly managers do not get you to follow up injury with your doctor or do not even recommend that you get professional medical attention unless you yourself INSIST to go to emergency
bad,"If you like never getting raises, working inconsistently and working with 🐍’s then this is the job for you! You will never be rewarded for work unless you are a favourite! Company is ran with no brains and they lack respect for there own employees, some managers would suck the customer off if it means they will shop here again, the amount this job made me drink was unhealthy"
bad,Unjust treatment towards black folk from management and management didn’t do anything when told discrimination was happening. All this happened at santee Home Depot
bad,"I hated this job because of my horrible boss!  She lacked skills in training me and to supervise others, unless you were here friend and kissed up to her!"
bad,"Management has a feeling of entitlement and ride on their high horses. No flexibility on schedules. Raises are .10 cents every 6 months. A lot of favoritism. And management are incompetent and don't even know how to ring out a customer, and if you ask them for help expect to be written up afterwards."
bad,They are the lowest paying company ive ever worked for.reguardless of your experience you will start at minimum wage.management want the greatest effort with no motivation.
bad,"They work you to death but no advancement,  no raise,  forced to work night shift to be F/T.  No work/life balance.  If u want to see ir eat dinner with your kids, forget it."
bad,Don't work here this place is the worst. Unless you like licking corporate staff or getting the shaft in your backdraft.  Don't hate yourself and work at HD
bad,Brent the Store Manager was arrogant and did not value his employees no matter how long they worked in his store. This place isn't worth the stress it brings. If you get hurt on the job and have to fill workers comp. then you better expect that you'll get fired shortly after since that takes away from his bonus. The turn over rate is ridiculous at this location.
bad,Didn't like to stand at self checkout and hear customers complain how the company is taking jobs from people by making them cash themselves out.  They would walk to other end of building to get a human to cash them out.
bad,It's a jungle. Just show up on time and do the impossible task. But at least you get benefits. Showing up one minute late could get you in trouble. Many people gossip.
bad,"The store I used to work at is poorly managed and understaffed on the weekends, especially Saturdays when it is really busy. Often times was the the only lot associate doing the work of multiple people. Can't keep their associates for long."
bad,You will NOT be happy working here. Spend time in a job with advancement and good management. These managers do not care about their associates safety or mental and physical well-being. Period!
bad,This job is very stressful and predictable and they did not value their employees they will work as an 105 temperatures with no AC and then If we hurt ourselves they did not care
bad,"If you go to work and don't stand up for yourself, you will succeed @ Home Depot, terrible scheduling, horrible management and no room for advancement if you're a minority."
bad,just to one word you just a number  nothing else  they don not care for you only management and supervisor take the hours of employees to give to supervisors.
bad,"I haven't learned anything from this company.  They are out for themselves and don't look upon certain people that work harder then those that do not. I liked being a cashier, But management was cruel and out spoken about failure.  U will be there running around with your head cut off doing a 100 things at once.  Left there to do your job and everyone else.  Its not a place for advancement.  I would never recommend this job to anyone. Not even my enemies, If i had any.  They do not work around your schedules or family times.  you are put there to work and make them money while they barely pay anything of wage.  Plus the hours were terrible and unorganized."
bad,"horrible management, this company does not care about its employees like it is advertised. advancement is based on if the manager likes you. if you request time off in advance you will not get it. this company is worse then walmart to work for. i would not recommend this job for anyone, they want military employees but dont give military discounts. they have managers then they department supervisors that do anything its like having more managers then employees that do nothing"
bad,expected to work 40 hours per week various shifts in an environment where they were always short handed.  Very low pay.  no chance for advancement.  management poor and only cared about their bonus.
bad,"I would not recommend this company. The focus is supposed to be the customer but it is actually sales. How can you make sales if the customer is not happy? I learned that management can be disrespectful to employees and it will be tolerated. Management is  lazy and short tempered. Management blames all of their issues on employees and is allowed to be disrespectful. If you speak up for yourself, they find a way to retaliate. The district office could care less. This place is is a temporary stop but it is not a place to have a career. Too many egos and not enough energy and team work to make sure the job is being done correctly."
bad,"The most unprofessional business I’ve ever worked for! No credit is ever given for any Work, missing hours on pays regularly, hostile work environment"
bad,"I interviewed for a totally different department and on day one in was advised they thought I was a better fit for a position I wasn't interested in. The training sucks as it's from one person's perspective but you shadow several people that contradicts the training. There are no standard operating procedures. Management doesnt know the billing programs your expected to assist customer's with. The pay is ok but the insurance benefits are costly. High turn over rate, high expectations with limited assistance, bonus is a team effort so it's never really met. If you're looking for consistency and a positive work environment look elsewhere."
bad,"It doesn't matter if you are part time or full time, if you are not a manager, you don't matter. No matter how hard you work, you are considered replaceable. In 3 years I have seen dozens of intelligent, hard working people give up and leave because they were not treated right. The hard workers get replaced with people who only work hard enough to scrape by, BUT if they can get people to sign up for credit cards or for a special service, like fence installation, then they are golden."
bad,"This company is the most disorganized company I have ever worked for.  They do not treat their employees very well at all.  It starts off at minimum wage, which is fine.  However the people who have been there forever still make close to minimum wage and therefore very disgruntled. "
bad,"The managers are horrible at communicating, the men that go there harass you on the daily, hours suck, the other departments never help you, Horrible."
bad,To much favoritism and promises  and acusses you of things you haven't done and doesn't care about your personal needs that's their way to get u fired
bad,"This company FIRED me after FOURTEEN plus years of employment.  Unjustly, I say."
bad,"I am shocked by how poorly the MET side is ran and its favortism and gossip is very childish"
bad,worst place I've ever worked. Management doesn't seem to know what they are doing. Constantly getting yelled at by customers. Salary is not worth the emotional toll of this place.
bad,"isn't a good place to work, inconsistent scheduling.. management doesn't know what they are doing and they don't work with your current schedule.. worst job.."
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible. Very racist, if you’re not a certain skin colour you’re treated very poorly. If you don’t get a Home Depot Credit Card you’re a on their surveillance and you will be watched and monitored. It’s a terrible place."
bad,"The Home Depot lacks at taking people seriously when they request a promotion. Team work is a joke there. Management is never around when you have a screaming customer. Coworkers are nice but can be lazy. The job is insanely stressful I left work crying three times in the 3 years I have been there. Some days you just question what is the point of this job. Underpaid and understaffed. People are fired for ridiculous reasons. Idiots or completely new hires get the big job titles while those looking and working towards that same job get nothing. They can also deny your days you request off, even at the last minute. You get flagged for missing or being late to work even if it's for an emergency and you don't have enough ""sick time"" to use for it."
bad,Home Depot says that they take care of your Associates when they really do not take care of their associates they put their Associates on the back burner and they deal with their bottom line. They are more interested  and making sales for the week and they are anything else you don't make it sales  you have problems. They are more interested in the stock market and what their stocks are doing in the alberty associates that are working for them on the floor. They also have reduced schedule work I was so there aren't that many Associates to assist customers on the floor when they most need the person in the department
bad,"No advancement opportunities, no full time opportunities, yelled at by managers for ‘bothering’ them while trying to get customers some assistance. Constantly pressured to sign up every customer for the Home Depot credit card, penalized by having your hours cut when you don’t sign up enough customers. Employees that have been there for years treat new employees badly."
bad,Horrible management. They dont have a care in the world for you unless it's benefiting them. Worst place to work. Wouldn't recommend working at home Depot in picayune.
bad,Dot go!! They will tell you and give you all the hype about moving up in the company but I was stuck in the same position while others were moving to departments and I had graduated from a class they offered and I was still stuck outside pushing carts..
bad,"Lacks proper management and needs better training.  Needs flooring re-fixed, needs to have at least 2 more security people. Needs a better circle of  proper supervisors who succeeds the expectation of and departments in the stores. The workplace was toxic, need stress classes to help the associates learn how to deal with stress. Hardest part of the job was always getting blamed for/ or written up for doing your job and how you were supposed to do it."
bad,"Is you have ambition and or expectations in life... you have to seek new horizons.  Not many chances to grow within and the salaries are very poor."
bad,"I thought it was going to be a short term temporary position until I could get back into the field of work I was trained to do.  8 ½ years later I simply walked away as I'd had enough..."
bad,"Most of the people there are rude and hard headed. They treat you awfully and don’t pay you nearly enough for the laboring departments like garden, lumber, or lot. The buildings usually had an odor because you’re near chemicals all day, not to mention the extremely high risk of injury, and ridiculous work effort and standards."
bad,The managers know that I want to move up and still don't see me as a beneficial leader. Instead they choose who they want based on favors and favorites. I 'm at the point of just leaving because there's no point in trying anymore. My only choose's are to leave wasting more time or transfer and hope for the best.
bad,"Worked there a few years back, management was a hot mess!! The whole store played favorites, if you we're not one on the inside there was no room for growth in the store."
bad,"This company is more about the customer them the associate even when the customers are so wrong. The customers will literally treat us like we are not even human beings and call us names and they still get thier way....if you are looking for a low stress job run from this one. The benefits were ok, thats about the only thing i will miss about this job haha."
bad,"At The Home Depot, you are left with a workload that is intended to be done by a supervisor because they did not finish it in their 9-hour shift. Managers are very unprofessional and they play favorites when it comes to young girls and they make them feel uncomfortable. While working there i was never thanked for all the hard work I put in it was always more criticism and not constructive where I could learn from my mistake but simply higher uppers talking about their workers behind their backs. It is a very hostile environment if you are young and not someone with power because you are see as less than. Often times you work a 5-hour shift and the manager gives you tasks that could have been done before you got there. Not only are you supposed to make sure the department is good to close at 10 but you also have the work load of the full timers who did not complete the work in a 9 hour shift but expect a part timer who was scheduled for 4 hours to complete it while closing the store. More times than other it will just be one person working one whole department and they work you even past your schedule and do not respect it."
bad,"I do not recommend anyone working for this company , I will tell you why "
bad,"Terrible place to work. They don't care if you know the job or not as long as they have a body. The store I worked at was always running short handed in every department. They expected one to do the work of 2-4 people and sometime had to cover 2-3 departments at the same time. Management was terrible and and didn't care about the employees. All they ever talk about is getting leads and helping each other. Worked there several years and was making the same amount as a new hire."
bad,"Well, here we go - another American Corporation in Canada that does not adhere to our employment standards.  The company is tedious, managment is stubborn and as a result the employees hate their lives.  Personally, I'm still waiting for my first pay cheque, they're now 8 days late.  Home Depot office is in Atlanta, so pretty much nothing can be done.  Stay away!"
bad,Senior management will bring their friends and fire anyone else that’s not part of the gang. Friends get the best schedules and hard working people will remain working nights and weekends forever.
bad,Minimum wage is not worth what you have to put up with here.  Management constantly updates and adds on to your workload and never do you see a reflection in your pay.  When you do get a raise you will be lucky to see 30 cents and hour for the year.... Pathetic
bad,Terrible place to work.poor management.unsafe work place.no advancement.nononononononono.......terrible employees.....not a team environment.. terrible training
bad,It's an OK place to work did overnights (drove me crazy) not really much to say about it its an retail store so expect the unexpected. Great job for high-school students
bad,They want you to do 3 people’s worth of work at a one person price. Advancement is all about brown nosing and not performance. Live the orange life is about not having a life outside Home Depot. Stay away unless your single and have no desire to live outside Home Depot.
bad,"What a joke!!!! I was told 20+ hours a week but after Christmas was down to 12 hours weekly (try paying bills,rent and raising your kids on that). And if you did receive hours(18-25) they would make sure it was spread out over 6-7 days.Not allowed a second job to compensate for there lack of hours, You must have Monday through Sunday availability period. Not allowed to get sick until you have accrued hours, expect a year for that to happen. And doctors notes are not accepted. No  store discounts at all and they may say your job is the most important in the store, but you are definitely not compensated in any way. Every head cashier or asst manager has their own rules, it's ridiculous.. Nepotism in full effect in these stores. And you are graded monthly on your ""numbers"" how fast you ring out, how many times you scanned an item,ect. Really sad actually. But if you do well you get a patch. AND MAKE SURE YOU SELL SELL SELL THE CREDIT CARD, but don't call it a credit card you have to call it the home depot card to trick people !!!!  Or you will hear about it daily, And you make nothing but it guarantees your store manager a great big bonus the more credit cards application you get...."
bad,"It was the culture, it was so strict and corporate, and the people I worked with were awful, mean, stuck up. I guess that's specific to my area though, and those individuals..."
bad,I just didn't like the opportunity that they gave me. I thought that they should have had offered full-time for my position. And they could have did a little more better job in training.
bad,Went in hopeful. Left beaten and abused. If you started working there 5 yrs ago you were hired in at 15 per hour and can make a living. Now it is not like that. Lots of politics.
bad,"I hated working at this place, no one is over on the same page and its all about who you know to get higher up.  The lower guy is the one that always gets in trouble if something is done wrong."
bad,"I've worked for the Home Depot for just under 2 years. I was hired as a Head Cashier, I stayed in that position for over a year and then went full time and was moved to the service desk. I enjoyed working with my fellow associates but management is the worst. They take advantage of the key carriers. The store is run so poorly right now. They need to treat associates the way they treat customers."
bad,"Managers and supervisors do not communicate well, ask to do one thing by manager and another by supervisor during the same time. Associates who suck up to management/supervisors get away with doing as they like."
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company, at least not the one located in Monroe Louisiana. The hours are horrible, the management is terrible, and the pay doesn't match the labor."
bad,This is a job. you go there and clock in and clock out. you wear an orange apron and sometimes they decorate the apron for you. Management turnover is high.
bad,"Home Depot been the worst employer thus far in my career.  Incredibly hyper-PC environment, people mis-communicate and obfuscate reality to avoid any unfavorable perception.  It's a company of paper generals, corporate speak, and lip service."
bad,the stores are heavily clicked based and promote bases on favoritism. the company also severely underpays its employees for how much money they make. Its great if you just need a paycheck but i wouldn't expect to make a career out of it
bad,"HORRIBLE place 2 work. Very STRESSFUL as a Cashier, we had to ask every single customer,  if they would like to open a credit card. We had to make sure we thanked them by saying, 'ty 4 shopping at Home Depot. We appreciate your business."" If we missed even one customer as far as offering a credit card & thanking them the correct way, we got pulled aside and reprimanded!! SUPERVISOR'S hound you everyday 4 not pushing the credit cards!! "
bad,Don’t work st Home Depot unless you want to expose your good life to amazing stupid things.  They have been fined 27 million dollars by the state attorneys office and the San Diego California district attorney for criminal hazmat dumping in the public landfills in California. DO YOU WANT TO WORK FOR THIS KIND OF EMPLOYER !  They have multiple lawsuits against them for abuse to their employees and placing people in danger throughout the USA.
bad,One of the worse companies to work for. they like to show favoritism. Its not what you know but who you suck up to. It was a place full of boot lickers.
bad,"Do not work here.  Enployees are treated like garbage.  No respect.  Customers can walk all over you and the managers do not care.  No employee discount.  "
bad,"Between management that never listened, coworkers who were homophobic, transphobic, generally rude and absolutely out of control, it was one of the worst work experiences of my life."
bad,"job was literal garbage, treated employees unfairly, and demanded way to much when the pay was laughable. don't even get me started on management. worse job experience ever."
bad,"I was sexually harassed, reported it, ended up quitting because they didn't care, Management was horrible and could not be trusted, everyone there is out for themselves, the new culture is hire them then look for ways to fire them, the hardest part of my job was walking in the door, the best thing about it was leaving for the day, days off, vacations. sick days, and most of all, the day I quit, anything to get me out of that building and away from those people (managers)"
bad,There were so many issues that came forward working for this company. After speaking to 3 managers about the problems no one cared. Favoritism was a huge problem more so because they would give cash advances to these people.
bad,face value home depot seems  fine but they dont really care. it all comes down to management. the better youre team the better the experince but they pay is not good plus part time hours can change at a moments notice
bad,I work stock and the management expects so much from me compared to everyone else. I do twice or triple the work of everyone else on the team and its still not enough sometimes.
bad,"the managers didn’t understand personal emergencies. they were rude, crude and socially unacceptable. i shouldn’t have to tell you my personal emergency for you to give me the day off."
bad,poor communication.  lack of focus and drive.  no motivation to excel.   poor appreciation of employees.  poor consistency between managers.  overall terrible place to work at
bad,"If you are looking for a job with advancement, do not work here! There is NO advancement unless you are best friends with the managers. I have seen hardworking employees who have been at this company for years be turned down full-time positions and the position is given to someone who had only been there for 3 months and was an awful employee. The managers treat the employees like garbage and don't care to help out, they only sit in the managers office and ""do paperwork"". I have seen people get fired for nothing, and then other people keep their jobs for actually breaking company policy. It's the managers decision so if you do get hired here, make sure you become best of friends with the managers otherwise you will not progress in the company."
bad,I was over worked and under paid I was subjected to a hostile work environment and the mangers failed to intervene I was called in to cover for other people's shifts and not paid accordingly
bad,"there is a click at the store i was working in. if your not in it your out all the way out . i would not work there for all he money in the world."
bad,"Ours used to be a fun place to work that was until it became all about the numbers & keeping the management happy. They began stripping incentives away from us, leaving us with nothing to work for. Management began treating their employees with great disregard & very disrespectfully refusing to even listen to us, some even refusing to speak to us about what is on our minds. They started tossing around accusations toward a few of their best employees. It is a very hostile environment."
bad,"I worked there for 18 months and I worked real hard.  Management didn't even recognize this kind of work all they recognized were people in a little clique who would snitch and Slack.  They gave promotions to people only in a clique.  Even if one customer complains they tell you to f@#$ off.  And they would make propaganda at orientation for you to say no to unions.  On another planet in another world, I would still never work for Home Depot again."
bad,Not a good place to grow. Once you apply for that position and get hired they won’t move you anywhere else . They won’t listen to your voice . Terrible management
bad,the job was not fun and the pay was horrible.  Please make sure that you are getting compensated accordingly.  I wouldn't work there again.  Ever.  ever.
bad,The company is purely micro managed the people in Atlanta Georgia and headquarters has the slightest idea what’s going on in the field at the stores throughout the country. When they show the customer comes first I totally disagree Management comes first. You never see a pay raise for employees just management
bad,"It was very simple. I filled out an application and within a week I was sitting in an office typing at a computer filling out the training courses. It is incredibly easy to start working here, even if you’re new to Canada and have very little experience. I did note one or two employees with disabilities. "
bad,The pay Home Depot gives is not good enough to live on. One would need 2-3 jobs to compensate what home depot pays. The scheduling is abysmal with only 1 employee usually working during peak hours.
bad,"the Home Depot in Milltown has the WORST management ever ! , the people who work there are little people its a retail do it yourself warehouse that pays minimum wages save yourself the imbarrasment"
bad,"·Designed and executed one-month training program for sales team increasing employee productivity and product knowledge."
bad,"Hay muchos trabajo y pocos empleados."
bad,most boring job ever just checking out people. no support or timeliness from managers. never got off my shift on time because of under scheduling. terrible store
bad,This is a great job for somewhere looking for part time work. Its hard to get full time work. They are very selective. Work schedule is not consistent.
bad,This is not a good company it's no growth no benefits not a company to stay in growing in this company is not a good look if you want to improve on work
bad,there are too many people taking breaks at one point low pay boring gotta get the chicken wing through the soda machine before the chicken wing smells again
bad,"All together being apart of this company was an horrible experience. No actual training, very competitive so no one wants to train you properly, training program is unrealistic, seniority rules over all no room from new workers to advance at all. Managers all trying to portray the role as GM , very dirty, etc"
bad,"Extremely racist environment. A place I would not work again. If this is how the people are. Everywhere at the Home Depot. I would not go back. Some of the people there are good people. But the majority are not."
bad,Terrible place to work for. Low pay horrible management. Low morale. Work for any other store but The Home Depot. The worst decision I have ever made was to work for this company. Save yourself the ulcer and dont bother applying.
bad,Was promised a full time position aswell as forklift training but never happened and management was terrible in keeping their word aswell. Not much room for growth opportunities since there is over 300 people in the warehouse and there is already people they favor which is highly noticeable.
bad,"Worst place to work at."
bad,"To many problems management will create , and will not suffer the Consequences.Associates will suffer to it as well as we did not have no voice to speak"
bad,Do not work there if you make a mistake and ring up something wrong your fired on the spot .People are miserable no advancement.You make very little money .Dont recommend employment  .Depending who you are one person found a gift card used it and got fired another person did the same thing and they fired her. depends who you are rules change
bad,no i just hated it there people dont help you and if your new your on your own so forget that place as a part time job because its ridiculous and stupid
bad,No overtime and if you have any you take it at your lunchbreak.stuck in flooring with little training.no consecutive days off.work at least one day a weekend.
bad,"Managers and employees have no respect for eachother "
bad,"They may tell you that you are the most important cog in the machine, but they will throw you under the bus for anything. Be careful with unruly customers because some of them know that you can't do anything to them and will come after you for fun."
bad,I was diagnosed with PTSD because of my working conditions. I am a manager and I am expected to be on site 24/7. Forget about this place if you have a family or forget your family if you do work here. My off site leader is the worst most unprofessional individual I have ever met. I spend almost 20k a year on benefits. I have no idea how a warehouse employee can afford home depot benefits. I hate the home depot. Bunch of clowns that bleed orange whatever that means.
bad,"Unorganized "
bad,Bad pay bad hours bad working conditions bad management no benefits no support for employees little room for advancement leading to a culture where none of the employees care.
bad,Don't care about there staff homeless vet I have nothing left to say I do night travel been trying to get on day shift due to homelessness but it's cool
bad,not a good place to work to work not paid right and bosses are horable and should be fired they are all  and don't care about workwers not fair to workers
bad,"A typical day at work for me is going to the registers and scanning out the customers. Everyday I learn about the different products the store offers, it seems like everyday they add something new to our shelves. Management is very respectful , never really bother you and are always there to help when you call. The most difficult part of my job is when I’m trying to help a customer and they come in already belligerent and not willing to listen to what I have to say. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I come in contact with a customer who provides me with a good conversation."
bad,I do not recommend working here as they do not pay fairly and expect the impossible. I do not believe that I was paid fairly for the work that I was doing.
bad,Home Depot takes advantage of young kids and older people.  They do not pay well for the work you do on a daily basis. Managers start at almost poverty level wages and are expected to act like they or being paid like CEOs.
bad,Not a place to work if you are allergic to something. They allow customers to be cruel to workers. Managers dont listen to you and don't consider health of employees
bad,You’ll go in first day and the managers will make you feel apart of a family . Then reality hits then you see that some managers don’t actually do anything nor know enough to criticize other departments. A place where one week they’ll offer you more hours then quickly change their minds with no warnings. A very strict work place.
bad,Was contract driver - store was completely lost in delivery and always wanted you to do free deliveries.  Was not fair to trucking company and they did not receive the appropriate compensation.
bad,Just a poor environment.  The job is centered around only making money not towards the employee at all. all about the share holders.  If you happen to get a good group of managers and associates it's alright - but the company has gone way down hill.  it's just a job - not a career
bad,"Absolutely terrible place to work. Horrible management they don’t care about you or anything about you. Absolutely nothing good to say . Weird coworkers, who smell horrible and have teeth falling out"
bad,The worst place to work. The management team have who they like and dislike and base on the the color you are is how they will treat you! Our life will not be safe if work for this company.
bad,Great work fun if you like this kind of place . breaks are not that good but it was ok you get to meet new and fun people and learn how to work in a store.
bad,"It was fine they did almost exactly the same as Lowes, Never enough help. No one does anything except exactly what they are told and nothing more. no ambition anywhere"
bad,"Management doesn't lead by example, poorly managed favoritism across the board.Good workers aren't motivated.poor pay overworked not innovated .Managers don't follow company policy they harass and bully there employees,furthermore the raises don't even cover your cost of living it;s really not a pay height at all ."
bad,no help from management  or other workers job is very stressful and there is no way to move up for a better position  the pay was horrible for the work they were asking to get done
bad,when I worked there management was very poor. plus I was told after my 90 day probation I would be considered for a raise and learn new stations solely determined on my work production and my numbers did not lie I was great. Yet no advancement at all
bad,i would never go back. the managers there were not good people. i never worked more then 30 hours per week. i was never able to advance in the company ...
bad,This place is a and not worth working at. they don't pay you and don't care about you. they will fire you if you don't do what they want even though it violates policy
bad,"Terrible management, terrible scheduling, always understaffed, unfriendly coworkers, some people get away with things others would not, very lazy associates, some associates get walked all over. Would highly advise not working for Home Depot."
bad,Bad management can’t even take lunch or a Break  managmemt always breathing down your neck wanting you to work faster raises are  really low depend from 15 cents to 50 cents. Lots of rude customer and the  hours they make you close and open the next day don’t wven get a full 8 hours of sleep before your next shift.
bad,"Building looks fancy, and they make lots of promises that are not kept. No way to move up with very high turnover. Agents held responsible for mistakes by scheduling department. Also- never buy major appliances from Home Depot- they don't allow returns... even if the item is broken or damaged. Once that truck delivers it, it's yours forever."
bad,"Petty environment ,constant drama, closing by myself ,unsafe work conditions, and hired a dangerous criminal. They also didn't care when a co-worker of mine "
bad,"As a whole the only redeeming quality i found with this company was my fellow co-workers. Not management but the other associates on during my particular shift. Short of overnight management and maybe 2 other asm/dh it was night and day. No communication between shifts. In particular overnight was expected to get everything done and make time to fix and clean what was left from prior shift. Yet if a single thing we're forgotten or not able to be done we would be reprimanded for it. All in all I've never worked for a company that prefers to have inexperienced specialists over experienced specialists. Never worked for a company that does so well on wall street yet can't even leave the lights, heat or air conditioning on for the overnight employees stuck in a metal roofed warehouse.  And finally i have never worked for a company so focused on there bonus checks that they sweep injuries and high price theft under the rug. I made the best of it but it turns out it wasn't good enough for our store manager."
bad,"typical chain retailer that cares more about the big picture tan the well being of employees and customers, horrible management do not not recommend ever"
bad,Most stressful and unrewarding work invironment I ever had. I would never advise anyone to work here. Also very harsh materials to work with. The pay is horrible and the lack of career advancement is remarkable
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work for Home Depot.  There are too many negative life crushing issues and once you've have fallen into this trap, it is very difficult to escape."
bad,Was looking for work advancement and never was given the opportunity.  People weren't promoted on work ethic or work merit.  Work very hard for them and wasn't able to have a work life balance
bad,Not only does the Home Depot UNDER pay their employees but they also expect you to do the job of someone getting payed a career level job. Highly greatful I no longer work for this company.
bad,"This store is simply not set up to succeed at all. The leadership in the store is extremely poor from the dept. Mgrs to store mgrs.If somone asked me ehat I thought were the strengths of the store mgr or dept. Mgr.I would I honestly would not be able to tell them. They just were not able to resolve any of the store's problems at all. There times when the mgrs. were nowhere to be found,at least I didn't see them for weeks at a time. Only job where leadership was an empty suit."
bad,"the time I was there, the store manager did not follow any of tool rental standards of operation, so moral falls and employees start to featherbedding on the job."
bad,"the home depot will suck the life out of you. I have see it drive one man to a nerves breakdown and another to a heart attack.  I have seen this first hand.  they only care about on thing, and thats the numbers,  80 hours a week with out being paid for it, no one is held accountable for the operations of this company,  its just fire and move to another person so we can pay them less"
bad,"managers inside this store are very rude and nasty, ive been in this store a few times and its ridiculous , manager talk to associates any kind of way in front of customers.Managers move very slow when it comes to helping out customers. they dont know how to answer the phone and when they do they are very rude and act like they dont want to do there job. and this is every time i go inside this store"
bad,"On the whole, this store needs a restructuring of management/leadership.  Proper training of staff in specialized areas and management that are willing to teach and answer questions when associates are in need of increased understanding of a give  area or situation."
bad,no help when I need to give customer service. cleaned 2 departments and restock shelves. I always need another associates to help customers. I was uncharge of 2 departments and I am the only associates who is responsible to provide customer care.
bad,Not enough employees for the customers was let go because i got hurt never could find a employee or a mananger if you needed help would never go back.
bad,"Managers typically only care about their sales numbers, and looking god to corporate, employees are not highly valued or appreciated. There is a pretty high turnover rate, it is unusual for people to work there longer than six months."
bad,"Excelente compañía para trabajar, buenas prestaciones."
bad,The managers and supervisors we're rude and made disrespectful comments towards other employees that they should have kept to their self and I wouldn't refer anyone to work at that location.     249
bad,Management won’t get their head out of their butts and talk to each other. They’ll tell you 5 different things before they’ll tell you the correct thing to do. They’ll blame you for things that could’ve been avoided if they would have listened to you the first time. They’ll fire you if you need to change your schedule. You definitely don’t get paid enough for what they put you through. The customers of Home Depot are the meanest customers around. Save your time and experience. 7 months went down the drain because they refused to fix what they messed up in the first place.
bad,The Home Depot is self serving....itself.  The Home Depot will throw you under the bus in a 💓 heart beat.  I saw this company get rid of many employees and falsely accuse employees.
bad,"I was stuck in one position, got heehawed around when trying to advance, and when my break time would come up, the managers would have to play find the associate to cover me for fifteen minutes or an hour. Not to mention watched quite a few managers just walk by customers and ignore them, had to use my little bit of Spanish to translate for a Hispanic couple b/c I couldn't get a translator to help me out, when I shouldn't have been doing that in the first place."
bad,I think you should find out for yourself to see what the place is about. then you can input your opinion on what on working at this place is all about
bad,Company do not care about rock and file personnel. Management personnel always get reshuffled. Requesting for time off is always an issue.Managements just cares who their puppets are.
bad,"Poor management, they treat their employees horribly, I know several people that left due to poor management including me. Would definitely never encourage someone to work their"
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for!!! I would not recommend anyone to go to Home Depot!!! They do not care about their employees! Only about their profit!
bad,I felt hugely discriminated against and the company as a whole was unorganized. I transferred from one location to another. There was never opportunity for full time employment
bad,Horrible supervisor who was always harassing me and giving bad remarks and reports to have me fired.Being a War Veteran and serving 20 yrs in the U.S.Navy did not matter to him.
bad,They will find a reason to get rid of you as soon as you start to make enough money to sustain a life or family. They will find something that you said or did and then give you no option to try to fix what ever they accuse you of.
bad,"I was hired to work part time and was told on average 25 hours a week. My schedule was often cut to much less. Always short staffed. I was always punctual and worked pretty much whatever shifts were asked of me. When I started college full time, I asked to cut back on my hours. No matter what change in days or hours I requested, my request was always denied. I was exhausted between work and school but did not want to quit. I suffered anaphylaxis at work one day and ended up in the ICU. I got in trouble for taking to much time of to recuperate. A month later my father almost died and was in the ICU. Again, I got in trouble for taking time off.  One day my supervisor came up to me in the middle of a shift and simply told me I was fired due to attendance. No warning, no chance to talk. Nothing. I bent over backwards to work when they wanted me to, they care not one bit about employee health, life balance or family needs."
bad,"Wasted time sheduling . Preparing, and intervening for a job that did not exsist at Hime Depot in Seneca , SC.  Spoke with corporate they use this job advertisements to recruit for lower paying jobs. “Bait and switch”"
bad,"- lack of leadership"
bad,"I don't believe it is Home Depot, the company, but just that Home Depot. I did not feel comfortable working there. I liked the employees, but not management."
bad,The whole environment wasn't right. There was no room to move up. There was to o much favoritism going on. The management never back you up on things.
bad,"Worse job I have had, very under paid, great benefits, optional 30 minute or 60 minute lunches, disrespectful and lazy management and some associates."
bad,"This is another commission based job.  Home Depot will provide you with leads that you must cover at specified dates and times.  You are required to stay with the customer for at least two hours making your presentation.  However, Home Depot does not properly QUALIFY the leads.  Many times I was sent to homes where the occupants were not the owners.  Many times people weren't even home!!  And phone numbers and contact information was never given.  Too much driving with not enough of a payday."
bad,the fast pace made the days go by quickly.  management is usually absent and no help.  pay is low for the work required.  scheduling is really bad.  never enough help
bad,I found that the underachieving employees set the standard and management retaliates against and are threatened by hard workers. This is by far the most poorly managed business I have ever worked for. Management does not want employees to succeed and discourages ambition. The best employees were never recognized and underachievers celebrated. Terrible place to work. Terrible company. Pay is the bare minimum. I would strongly recommend continuing your job search and not settling for such a subpar position where dreams go to die.
bad,"Home Depot only looks out for itself!!! Cut Throat, taking care of our people is one of their core values, unfortunately only on paper................."
bad,I would not recommend working at the Home Depot if you are female. The management does not take Action when needed. Will not work here again. Was not for me
bad,The management was miserable and there was rarely much help to new employees. Learning information to help customers was very difficult due to a lack of assistance by superiors or senior employees.
bad,"I worked at the Home Depot for 8 plus years and have knowledge in almost all depts including a reykeying locks and backup cashier, I started @ $9.50 and am only making $12.75 my sister just got a job there and is making $13.00/hr. I like my job, and the best part of my job is the customer service."
bad,"They couldn’t guarantee me that I could at least have every other weekend off to spend it with my kids when I am supposed to have them every weekend, and my family comes before any job."
bad,"Home Depot does NOT allow you to grow or Supervisor does NOT listen when you explained to him/her over about 10th time about any issue or situation,"
bad,"In my time working for them I noticed management was more concerned with being liked than actually managing correctly or professionally. In fact the management there is probably the most unprofessional I have ever worked for. Higher-ups often promoted underqualified individuals that were favored over those with actual experience. They dont work with your schedule, managers talk down to associates when they are angry, cussing and swearing, they use their status as a way of intimidation. One manager was so unprofessional he surrounded himself with girls 1/2 his age, taking them to lunch or letting them lounge in his office, letting them take 2 hour lunches or breaks over 15 mins. I once got called into the managers office for calling one of these girls out on her carp and the manager told me, and I quote, ""mind your own business."" Hated that place glad I left."
bad,"I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemies. The management was terrible. They regularly scheduled me outside my availability, and sometimes I didn't get enough hours."
bad,"Management does not practice what they preach.  "
bad,"High Stress, low pay, part time employment with little rewards or recognition for job well done."
bad,25 years ago it was a great company. New wave of people who don't care and do not follow the chore values from years ago. Was treated very unfairly at the end.
bad,"I chose to work for this company Just because of great manager (TED) in Port Coquitlam Branch."
bad,"Don't work here! Management sucks, there are no raises and the minute you complain about anything you are subject to termination without information or knowledge. Far to many qoutas to meet and the call volume is unbelievably high and the breaks are not sufficient"
bad,"As a cashier I was not permitted to leave the checkout area, so I could not help a customer locate the item that they were looking for by guiding them to an area. If I called a department to help locate a product I was often told by the employee in that department that they were too busy to help, or they would not answer the call at all. As an employee you were expected to sell the Home Depot credit card, if you did not acquire a certain number of credit card ""sells"", it was held against you."
bad,"No support system. Managers would lie about you and make you feel bad. If someone was jealous of you because you are a good hearted person and the whole place liked you they would fire you. "
bad,"I was a lot associate. I cleared shopping carts or labor carts out of the parking lot, also while keeping the outside clean. Management wasn't the best to say the least."
bad,"Over the years, this particular home depot location has decreased in keeping their hourly employees happy and in turn have focused on making their salaried employees the priority."
bad,They show a lot of favoritism. If you are not a suck you will not move up. Supervisors will team up to get you fired. Their is no privacy between staff and HR.
bad,"not a place for advancement "
bad,"Poor management with very little understanding of sales associate job responsibilities, at times unsafe work environment, employees have no input to decisions."
bad,"Customer Care is a GOD AWFUL department to work in. The ""leadership"" is discombobulated and messy.  They play favorites and will stop you from getting ahead.  This place is a BLACK HOLE!"
bad,I got let go cause I was sick and they didn't except my hospital excuse.  They wanted me to cover 2hrs over sick pay for 2 weeks.  What a joke. I had family issue and they told me they would help me but at the end they didn't they screwd me over. They're was able of favoritism.
bad,They do not give you a car allowance and will find any reason to short you on your commissions.  Most of the appointments are trash.  They make you a W2 employee and don't give you a car allowance so you can't write off the mileage and depreciation expenses on your income taxes.
bad,"Home Depot is a corporate machine that treats its employees like numbers. No time to help customers, or build relationships with employees, just metrics and tasking."
bad,"I would not recommend Home Depot to anyone.  The air-conditioning was broken (wink, wink) for the entire summer(s) that I worked there.  It was so hot sweat would literally drip down your face and back, working there was exhausting."
bad,"Management was uncommunicative, and did not recognize the importance of the chain of command. In an unrelated matter, AT&T did not get service in the store!"
bad,"management has no regard for working staff, actively cutting hours, force people to quit, refuse to pay for medical leave, will refuse to pay out for owed vacation time upon quitting, medical coverage is horrible, multiple safety violations, management actively bully associate staff!!!"
bad,working at Home Depot was the hardest job ive ever had. Too much returns and theft. hours were poor and pay was low. not enough customer service and front end hectic.
bad,They make you think its a family job and the camaraderie is there. urrrrgh WRONG. I wouldn't recommend this job to my enemy. While some people will say eh it wasn't bad...this place had a turn over rate so much people didn't even bother to learn peoples names. It was a bad culture and I don't recommend it to anyone. Good luck if you enjoy it. No benefits besides dental and eye care....great. or you know. brush your teeth.
bad,"The supervisor was rarely around. Training was brief. Assistance was procured from other associates if they had the time. I was grateful for the part-time position as it helped pay the bills, but would not seek a permanent position there."
bad,to force someone to review a company i have not worked for in 14 years is a bit much and i'm sure not helpful to anyone i don't care for this much and feel we should not be forced to do this
bad,The only experience I had great with was excellent people that I work with it's just the pay was horrible and the management was poorly and very unorganized.
bad,I worked as a cashier at home depot for 2 years. My cowokers made work fun. Sometimes customers did as well. Sometimes I had disgruntled customers sometimes people stole from the store. I wouldnt recommend working here.
bad,"If you'r looking to be under appreciated and to go back to high school working for Home depot is perfect for you. I went above and beyond my job title, covered extra shifts, worked over time, and not once did I get a thank you. They give Homer Awards for people coming in on time to those who don't come to work but don't compensate for those who are on time every day and pick up extra shifts. They don't appreciate their workers even though they say they do.Their values and the inverted pyramid is a front. They want you to believe that they care and will do anything for you, However this is not the case. underpaid, over worked, and unappreciated. That is all you will get if you are an actual hard worker who cares about others. Don't waste you'r time."
bad,"Each individual is literally viewed as a statistic."
bad,When I enter to work here everyone was very nice and outgoing I was a regular cashier I was always on the floor helping and making sure the customers fiynd what they were looking for.
bad,It was one of my first job so for first time it wasn’t bad but management could have had a lot to work on . Besides this it was a great learning experience on making sure I’m a supportive manager Role.
bad,"This has been the most disrespectful, unfair, unprofessional, hateful, discriminatory, disgusting, prejudice, to the borderline harassment corporation I have ever worked for. If you know someone who is going to apply, please be advised that they will be treated like S#*t! Fair warning."
bad,"Never before has the idiom 'people don't quit jobs, they quit bosses' applied like here. They don't care if there is a problem, if you're unhappy, if something's not right. Just don't bother them."
bad,"Horrible place to work!!  No real leadership!! Management will return anything, used toilets, gas powered equipment, pieces of things & giving a full refund???"
bad,"Home Depot is a horrible company!  Managers change all the time & when they come into Kitchens, they will argue with your point on an issue as they don’t know the correct terminology, & have admitted to not knowing it!  "
bad,"Home Depot abuses of all male workers, in the sense that they make us work insane hours. Also they make you learn how to drive forklifts without offering proper compensation. They don’t know how to appreciate hoard working employees. The only way to get promoted in The Home Depot is if you’re in tight with management."
bad,"Terrible place to work both on overnight crew and with the daytime crew, the will try to manipulate you to work far harder than anyone else, my advice be a lazy worker from the start so their expectations are low otherwise you will be the only one sore and sweaty at the end of the day or night."
bad,"management does not promote a respectful, non-confrontational environment. Everything seems to be set up to promote stock holder benefit at the cost of the main workers."
bad,"Worked in bad environmental in this company. Bullied ever single day, I ´ve sent complain to HR, but no results. I am trying to get a full time but it was worst, they fired me and said the reason was attendance. Everybody come late, in that company (6372) they fix it, bt not for me."
bad,this company sucks they hired me at 8 dollars and hour told me full time but only gave me 4 hours a week. i had to drive 30 minutes to work so i was paying to work. then they hired the seasonal people on at 10 dollars an hour and when we asked about it they said we should quit and try and get hired as seasonal.
bad,never enough help not any kind of order everybody is a boss not clean not at that one favor employee always hiring but not checking work history of the people
bad,"I can’t begin to describe the good thing old boy club at the HD it still exists, you only advance if we are liked and  who you are friends with, they say they want you to make a difference and changes and then they change there make mind !"
bad,"Very poor upper management.  Not family friendly.  verbally abusive management.  Would rather scold than praise.  If the store were to burn down, I'd be the first person there to urinate on the ashes!!!!"
bad,"Definitely not a place for black advancement, at least not at the store that I was working at. often times we were told to train our new supervisors which I think is just ridiculous."
bad,"They expect you to do your job without any disagreement on what they are doing. Sometimes things were pretty bad, especially if you are single. If you get hurt they expect you to work, even if you are in pain"
bad,"very nice pace to work, everyone should apply and start working. It is a very fast paced place to work and very competitive. great experience. really enjoyed my job experience."
bad,"Management team are very lazy they keep hiring supervisors because they are all lazy and usually on their phones, they need a real HR manager, they need to clean house and start over with real loyal, caring hard working management crew not the fake crew they have now."
bad,bad company to work for they care nothing for their workers or the customers what so ever. when you do try and help customers they chastises you for treating the customers like people
bad,This company does not care about your family life. They expect you to work through every holiday. Nine times out of ten your requested days off are denied. Do not work for this company. You are only a number to them not a person.
bad,i don't really have anything positive to say about this place. please just stay far away and dont bother applying to work here. go to lowes instead of here
bad,"The absolute worst job i have ever had.Management is poorly trained, as is the staff.They will use you and abuse you for whatever they need.Drug use was rampant,but management looked the other way."
bad,"This a typical retail job, paid hourly, no holidays off no weekends off. very hard to make a schedule in your personal life until the schedule is released."
bad,"I'm still a current employee but am looking to leave asap. Can't believe I have stuck around for almost four years. Every year divisional directors would come to town and tell everyone how they understand how we are underpaid, how they recognize that work life balance is terrible, how they recognize that they will get us help and even how they recognize and acknowledge it's a ""Hostile"" work environment but then they leave town and both the sales and install managers turn up the heat, the lies, the unethical buisness practices, how customers are being lied to, cheated from and yes, even stolen from and if you bring it up to anyone (or HR), your gone."
bad,"Large company, hard to advance, low pay. You feel like you disappear as a human when working there. Not a lot of help or mentoring. Large expectations."
bad,"Maintained high level of profitability through report analysis, identification of trends, and properly scheduling a team of associates for maximum showroom penetration."
bad,Home Depot would be okay to work at if management didn't drink the orange kool aid. Meaning they can do things like recording stolen items as damaged so it doesn't affect their shrink (stolen stuff) so that it looks like they are good money managers but if you don't have bags on your register they write you up. Or they tell you to lie when it has nothing to do with you.
bad,"If you do work there and ever have a injury, you will have an instant target on your back. All they care about is money for the store. Employees are treated with no respect at all. The whole family line is just that, a line of lies. I am so glad to be out of that place. Would just be sick to my stomach every day before having to go in that store to work."
bad,I had a bad experience there all co- worker keep yelling and screaming at night as freight crew back in 2003. Work load is so over whelming and very stressful the supervisor yells all the time. people quit job there in less than 6 months.
bad,"The camaraderie among my piers is solid. However, the moral is low thanks to a lack of support from upper management. The average raise is maybe 10 cents."
bad,"After trying to advance in the company, by transferring to another store, management didn't work with me."
bad,"Mainly for adults that are attending school or High School Teens. Poor management, not enough pay, constantly moving Associates around into different departments with no training, overtime has to be cut, hours will be consistent for a little while and then become scattered, co-workers arguing, management has their own favorites, nothing about it is appealing and hard work goes unnoticed."
bad,"The management team does nothing, but walk around and find things employees are not doing. In the interview ""Teamwork"" was a strongly implied, well there was NONE. There is no hope of full time employment as stated by the Manager ""we only hire part time""  so not enough hours to make a living and no benefits. This job will do while I look for decent work."
bad,"Management plays favoritism and when it comes time for your review/raise, they barely give  you one.  People I worked with were two faced backstabbers.  Just like management."
bad,If management didn't like you they worked with other hourly employees to get you fired. Everybody talked about everybody behind their back. Supervisors rarely gave credit to the right people. If management didn't like you they hardly ever schedule you for more than 20 per week.
bad,"What would change the culture their is a union. Then you could afford the benefits they offer and live a halfway decent lifestyle. What good is offering all these benefits that the workers cannot afford. The raises are pitiful and they think what they are doing. How many associates collect food stamps and other benefits to survive. Home Depot only worrys about its management and shareholders, they could care less about how its associates live, take a bus to work, because you can’t afford a car, but don’t be late. I could go on and on, but without a union, it’s not going to change."
bad,"I worked here 2 times, during separate timeframes. The company as a whole I feel is fairly good. The store manager at my location was in lack of a better term ""two faced"". They would say that they would ""get back to you"" or ""they haven't forgotten"" about you. They would then proceed to promote others and brush you under the rug. It was difficult to please the management even if you tried your best. I consider myself a hard worker and very customer service based. Kiss up to the SM and do everything by the book, you may or may not advance. If they like you that is."
bad,Hated every day  I was there especially my blood headed manager she was cutting hours due to color of people skin and if customers didn't do the online surveys
bad,I liked the company but working for them was not a joy. I did not like the management at this Home Depot. I was a cashier and did not like having to scan the big pieces of lumber and such.
bad,worked in the carpeting department cutting carpet rolls and scheduling appointments to have carpet installed in the customers homes as well as lifting 75 lb cases of tiles for home usage
bad,"It was social ground for everyone, no one was helping employees and management was very poor. They overworked you for little pay and treated all employees with a expendable mentality."
bad,"The home depot is a horrible place to work, the pay is terrible with no room for advancement and the managers are all unqualified idiots who sit around and do nothing. Expect everything to be done with no staff scheduled, the home depot doesn't run like a business but more so a high school, favoritism is huge and all the people who work here are miserable."
bad,They do this training but nothing that really translates to the actual work on the floor that you will be doing.My pay for a month barely broke a $100 dollars.  The employees that have been there are not very helpful.  Like most big companies Home Depot is no exception. They won't give you the hours you need to get insurance and the won't pay you a living wage.
bad,The company abuses their workers overworks them and once they reach the max of their raise limits they get rid of them not a great company to work for cutthroat company. They treat employees like garbage. If you do get hired just become a brown nose and you're guaranteed your job until they get tired of you..
bad,Waste of time if you are trying to go back to school they don't want to corporate with your schedule also the mangers barley like to do there job and if you need help they don't help you out and they are not reallu professional and there is to much drama
bad,Great if your 14 or illegal aliens blahblah. Just a bunch of lazy managers watching a very understaffed crew do there bidding. They get big bonuses and the serfs get nothing
bad,"The pay is too little to live off of for starters, this is the first time I have worked full time, and have no money to show for it as I scrape to pay my rent and Bill's.  "
bad,it is a good fun time lots people who are good workers the bosses are nice and the customers are too I would like to stay at this job for as long as I can
bad,home depot sucked working at that place. I never felt like I was part of a team.You were just a number with that place.Don*t try calling in sick they well make you feel like a loser for not coming in to work
bad,"kept asking for more productivity and no additional compensation.They changed their product line and electronic database, required better workers to check the work of less qualified workers, and thus decreased compensation. I took a 10,000 pay cut with this management decision."
bad,New hires with connections paid higher wages than workers already on payroll for same position. To much responsibility expected for low skill low wage positions. Every one in position paid the same regardless of performance. No merit based pay raises. Raises set anonymously by corporate office.
bad,Home Depot is a horrible company to work for if you are looking for full-time work! I would not recommend anyone to apply to work here. I had a very bad experience.
bad,Supervisors we're arrogant and not trained enough to run staff very disrespectful and have relationships with staff and as I'm concerned still do and favor them as well.... I wouldn't recommend the warehouse in perris to anyone very unprofessional and stressful..
bad,The place is a joke it's like a jail you have to work so hard and fast that they do not care if you hurt yourself or thing they will tell you your not working fast work hard
bad,"Horrible managers, staff is unstable, most of the staff was hard to work with because they had very bad work ethics, the managers were rude and they did not work with school"
bad,Everyday it was new people getting hired and it seemed like they were way over staffed for no reason. How do you keep up with every employee or even know there name? i felt we were all just numbers to them!
bad,"Working at Home Depot was relaxed, slow pace work. All store departments were not always able to help with customer questions or staff. Low pay and never a set schedule made it very hard to maintain a family schedule."
bad,"Did not like working here. I liked some of my co-workers, but not many of management or direct supervisors.  Didn;t like the whole midro-management of the copmany."
bad,"So many Managers, no one is on same page with duties. Very hostile environment, Managers as well as Supervisors quit often, it was a revolving door. Some associates would leave for lunch and never return."
bad,They did not treat the temp/part time people very well.  They go through so many people that they do not even try to be nice to them.  Felt like a outsider and the regular staff would hardly give you the time of day.
bad,"this place is toxic, its like working with a bunch of immature students. Lots of gossip and drama. The pay increases are awful. Good luck getting even a 0.25 raise per year"
bad,Worked 15 hours a week in the store without pay of any type. Traveled hundreds of miles without being paid for travel. 
bad,"Home Depot excels at self-promotion and propaganda constantly describing themselves in glowing terms, however, the truth is that they have suppressed worker wages for many years and most associates survive on below-median or poverty level income while enduring poor working conditions. The company founders ""love capitalism""... and they should; they grew incredibly wealthy while their front line associates struggle to survive in the face of rising costs of living."
bad,"Environment very stressful, hot, loud paging constantly with phones, radios and over head. Hard work for not much pay."
bad,"They wouldn't pay me for my orientation because it would give me overtime and they couldn't pay new employees overtime hours. "
bad,Crazy hours and meetings at stupid times.  People are rude to employees.  I would never work for home depot again ever in my life.  I had hours that would end in the evening and I would have a early morning schedule the next day. Who does that.
bad,I dispensed paint for customers and i also color matched paint for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new. The part that sucks is dealing with management that can never find coverage for your lunch breaks sometimes you don't even get a break also they are very unorganized.
bad,"This place has the worst management I have ever seen. My coworkers were leaving and being fired left and right. They don't let you go to the bathroom until they say that you can. It got so bad at one point that I literally peed my pants because they wouldn't let me go to the bathroom for 2 hours after I asked. There were no happy parts of the job, and if you work here, you will regret it!"
bad,Bad company. low pay. dont bother working there. I dont want to write a review but you guys are making me for some reason. this sentence is just to take up characters..
bad,"Workplace is very fast and there always an accident whiting to happen. I learned how to use a reach truck, order pick, a paser forklifted. A typical day is unload the truck and stocking the shelves"
bad,"Love my job at the customer service desk; no two days are alike. While the issues may be similar, the different personalities each customer brings to the table can be challenging. My personal goal at the end of each day is to provide excellent customer service and build strong relationship with our customers; encouraging the ""likely to shop again"" Home Depot mission."
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had . Racism, sexism, manager was awful rules only applied when he felt like it and only to a certain group of people."
bad,I have nothing nice to say about this company and like i was told growing up if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say it at all. I don't recommend people apply here.
bad,"I learned how to set up a bay according to blueprints provided by vendor. "
bad,"the supperviser did not like the fact i was learning how to stock the store with out the hand held device and chad did not like many of his work he fried me and the guy i was hierd with and made a person quit and every body else went to a different dept, as soon as they could chad canme up with atrumed up charge to get rid of me not a nice guy and no body else liked him ethrer"
bad,"Lake Park location is full of HR issues. The pay isn't worth the stress of manipulative tactics by management, broken promises and baiting by upper management, and the poor work environment."
bad,Heavy people traffic.  How to become a much better people person. Management offered no chance for advancement. Negative attitudes. Stressful. Leaving
bad,"Management is done by spreadsheets. To cut costs many departments often are not staffed.  They work some employees likes slaves, low pay, too much work due to short staffing, and in general really don’t care about their employees. Employees gossip, talk, and basically bully other employees. Department heads are not held accountable. Run as fast as you can away from working at Home Depot."
bad,"Bad management, and bad working conditions.  Was typically expected to do the work of 4 or 5 people, then get yelled at and written up when I couldn't do it.  Terrible company with terrible managers."
bad,Starting out I had to be there at 5:45 AM and I didn't like that so I had that changed.  And then the day I wa fired a cortractor yelled at me while I was checking him out a the register.  And another customer had one last item in his/her cart and I told them that 3 times and they wouldn't listien to me.
bad,"Wife had affair as a, supervisor with"
bad,I hated working here because people and rules kept changing. The pay kept changing too. The co-workers did not have a team-work spirit and was all the time complaining about everyone and everything.
bad,"I did not like it, was not for me. Companu lacks respect for employees. Also they are horrible with team work and lack customer service. Lack of management"
bad,horrible management.  Does not care for the employees.   Makes you work harder than what you pay.  If you do not kiss butt you will not move up.  This is not a great corporation
bad,"The only real enjoyable thing about the job is when you actually help a customer. The rest of it is loathsome.  It's not really rocket science, but you would think so the way some people can't manage to do simple tasks. I witnessed a brand new person who had never worked in a department, placed in a position to open it up first thing in the morning and with no support or training. This place gets a gomer award for sure."
bad,They smile as they expect you to do something out of your job duties and as long as you keep listening you're fine until they hire in someone else who doesn't know better yet. Don't bother asking for help or back up because managers will tell you to find it yourself
bad,"They only promote their friends and with me, it was who was their race. They would have you work a higher paid job without giving you the pay. When you address them, they act like they have no idea what you're talking about."
bad,"I showed up and worked hard but received no appreciation whatsoever, while being back-stabbed by the dept manager and her friends... in addition to the poor pay and scheduling."
bad,This company is not ran like they say they are. They hire you and and tell you what you want hear about progression throughout the company and raises and things like that but none of it ever happens and that’s why the turn around rate is so bad.
bad,"The managers are all qualified through a computer course. Typically, the Contractor Manager has no.idea about construction! Take you lumber business to a local company; they need and appreciate your business. Home Depot is an American Company that should not be allowed to operate in Canada"
bad,stock supplies as they are need during store hours. maintain the area. keep the aisle and shelves clean and free of thrash left by customers. very  demanding customer service
bad,"The mandatory of getting credit card was overwhelming, We got written up if we didn't get them. They had preference of who would get breaks first and we would have to take additional time off our breaks if we had over time because management would let us off late"
bad,"Work day started with a team meeting to assign projects to each team member. I learned various skills including, Strong verbal communication skills. Ability to communicate the goals and objectives of the assigned organization, company, or department."
bad,this company does not value its employees.there is no flexible schedules . the cashiers make the same as the guys breaking there backs all day and the guys operaating the forklifts . it should only be used as a stepping stone because this company will wear you down chew you up and spit you out
bad,"they literally do not care about anyone"
bad,Their was a lot of hostility and rumors in this workplace. The store had a lot of racism and sexist going on. Management was made aware and didn't take action.
bad,Say they care for you and family but will fire you if you have to visit more than once if you have emergency to go to Ottawa for family they give time off but will backstab you later on
bad,"drive sales to support department and store goals. Each associate has the responsibility of providing a safe working and shopping environment by following all safety policies & standards, completing specified safety training, immediately correcting hazards & unsafe conditions or reporting conditions to the Manager On Duty, and working safely as not to endanger themselves, co-workers, vendors, or customers."
bad,"Then discontinued the position I was working in and did not offer any other job opening I could transition to. The position I was in started at 4 in the morning and ended, usually, at 10 am which limited by availability to take a second job elsewhere."
bad,Management were oblivious. Coworkers were horrible people many of which stole from the store regularly. Human resources person truly did not care about people at all.
bad,"This is not a job you can make enough to live on. It's a ok part time job or a job for someone who is retired and bored. The pay raises are usually about 5 cents a year unless you move to a higher position and they play favorites, so don't expect to move up the ladder unless they really like you."
bad,"Typical workday would include showing customer where product is and giving proper directions to said locations so the customer is satisfied."
bad,your day depend on the customers you deal with  with in the day co-workers are alright gives you lots of training in departments in which you work in all in all fun place to work at
bad,While coworkers become family the pay is so not enough to compensate for what you have to put up with. The workload. The lack of coverage. The managers suck and don't care. And customers can be absinthe but there's always those terrible ones. Very underpaid even if you are rated excellent on your yearly review.
bad,"horrible place to work. stressful, poor management, raises not enough. work you 15 hours a day then tell you to cut the overtime. no support from management."
bad,Awful place to work. Part time hours no advancement. Bad supervisors. Terrible pay.  Terrible benefits. Work you like a dog and get nothing in return. Rude supervisors and bad environment overall.
bad,Horrible place to work. Atleast the one in pharr Texas was. They don't care about their employees on the floor. They only care about the ones at service desk.
bad,ASM lives are a living hades. Managers have zero authority and live in constant fear of employees as there is zero HR backing at any level. If you enjoy a 60 hour work week - please apply.
bad,hard work. tyrants for assistant managers. they had little training. co workers were nice. hated climbing up and down the big metal ladder .they fire people for no good reason.
bad,"If you were a favorite then you were treated well, but only management's friends were favorites.  Awards/Bonuses given out only to favorites.  Benefits only given to full-time but no full-time positions ever made available, only part-time.  When take on more responsibility or training, such as becoming a forklift operator, no increase in wages"
bad,I was fired due to poor training. The management here doesn’t take responsibility for their own mistakes and blames other people. Not a fair environment.
bad,"I worked at THD for 7 years and they are garbage in every way except pay. I was making $19.90 as a Department Manager."
bad,There really isn't anything great about the payment there. The only thing great about there is the workers. But the management isn't really proactive with their jobs. To much gossip and issues amongst themselves.
bad,"Typical day investigation frauds and thefts."
bad,"Management Clique and those who follow closely are the ones who receive recognition, promotions, and/or bonuses, The Few have Much Power."
bad,I worked there over ten years they pay just enough to keep you coming back for more every year cots of living goes up your raise doesn't equal that so every year you make less and less the longer your there the more likely you are to be targeted for termination I seen more people  with 10 plus years fired and replaced with 3 pt associate
bad,"There isn't much more to say, honestly."
bad,You work too hard for very little pay. Working overnight all I had to do was stock. We only have about 9 people working to stock the entire store for when it opens. They ship us way to many items for us to manage and we're expected to clean up everyones mess.
bad,Horrid store. Not worth ever going back there. I was the first point of contact for a lot of the people coming into the store. I would give them their carts that I had to set out as the GM at the time had asked me to do.
bad,great company to work for however the managment in this store is a joke. there was one manager there that actually cared the rest didnt care about anything but their paycheck
bad,"The workplace environment was really bad, I do not recommend working there. Each day was hard to get along with management, and they were always looking to hire Highschool students to take place of already full time workers. Doing this allowed them to cut back on employment cost, which hurt the business and its employees."
bad,"Don't waste your time with this company, you are better off working somewhere else unless you like being bullied by everyone, including upper management."
bad,I would not recommend this job if you need to support a family.  It is too stressful for what they pay.  There is never enough help and management is non existent
bad,Working for home Depot in Madera CA I joke .Management won't help always a competition with Lowe's.  Fun sad. Employees are cut throat. A joke of a job. On the job training .You don't know you won't know
bad,"ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE"
bad,"I am going on my 3rd yr at home Depot, they never gave me a raise until they had to, all they care about are the people that get credit cards, if you don't get credit cards you don't exist to the home Depot"
bad,"Poor management and terrible leaders."
bad,"Not very flexible with scheduling, the old men are condescending and rude, stand on your feet all day with minimal breaks, you learn a lot about your department, the bosses are strict, but coworkers are nice."
bad,"I loved the previous location I worked at, but due to unforseen circumstances I ad to move, so i transferred. HATED the new branch.The culture and management was poisonous."
bad,This place pulls you in different directions at once. I hated this job but I loved the people I worked with. This company wanted me to move up in the company but did everything possible to prevent it at the same time.
bad,"I've worked at home depot for over 14 years the company has really changed.  Each department is under staffed which means you have to work extra hard, and very stressful. Unable to contact management when needed no one answers the phones when directing to any department at the store.  None of the computers work correctly which makes transactions harder/longer to process, the returns line is always long out the door. Due to the register's scanner's don't work or register's freezes."
bad,"The company had a good reputation with it's sales people. Most of which were in the same role making a six-figure income year over year. However recent changes in technology, operations, and management have prove to be a considerable downturn on this once great company. There is no work life balance, working upwards of 16 hours a day, 6 days a week. Territory is unknown to all sales consultants and no leads are qualified prior to being put on your schedule. Very significant amount of time wasted driving (You're own car) and not having company required resources to sell. Nearly every sales consultant in the country is losing about twice as much as they are making. Do not work for this company unless you have a desire to drive in circles and pay the company a salary out of your own pocket."
bad,"Working in the garden center overworked and very stressful"
bad,When i worked there the managers were awful people who only cared about how much money they took home at the end of the day. Employees don't get raises unless they work for about 3 years. Also if you get hurt while working they blame it on poor stretching and refuse to let you go home unless you need to go to the hospital.
bad,"The job was very easy, it was just management that was so unorganized. There was no type of communication and the wanted us to do too much for so little pay."
bad,"I was “part time” and I was working full time hours with a baby at home and nobody understood that.  Was titled a cashier, and always ended up doing more than what I was hired for"
bad,management is terrible. management is affiliated with substance abuse with employees. employees are not treated right and management abuses its power.
bad,"Home Depot is hands down the worst place iv ever worked. They act like they put employees first,  but they really dont. They act like they can never give you the days / time off you need. And the schedule is very inconsistent. They also do the scheduling 4 weeks in advance so you have to request time off about a month in advance.  Which is challenging because if something important comes up that you have to do your kind of S.O.L. "
bad,"Hostile work environment, the worst pay scale I have run into. They cut out our bonuses because they had unexpected payroll costs due to competition in the area."
bad,"Not worth your time, blood, sweat, and tears. Management will walk all over you and not care. If you do choose to work at Home Depot, make sure you never miss a shift. Even if you have a doctor's note for a missed shift, management will somehow use it against you. Especially if they don't like you, they will use it to get you fired. Watch your back!"
bad,I started off lot associate. Didn’t grow from there during my 3 months there. Customers were cool. Workers were cool but the pay differentiated due to the position!
bad,"I am very much into DIY as hobbies, and for for building a resume, was a great start. Unfortunately; wasn't the sort of environment I enjoyed to be in."
bad,Management is unappreciative and unless you're a guy who works there most female employees are under paid. As a cashier you aren't paid enough. Training is the only thing they do well.
bad,Typical day would be to get carts and fix things around the store. I learned that the employees are very stressed and management and workplace culture was very cutthroat. Hardest part was figuring out what to do and enjoyable part was making sure the customers were happy
bad,"under paid, over worked, managers didn't treat you with respect."
bad,"Working at Home Depot was the most unhappy I ever was as an employee.  The managers were forced to work very long hours and family and work life balance issues were often neglected.  So much that during a training session, the trainer stated that if you have not have marital issues yet, you weren't working hard enough.  Immediately after that day I started looking for new employment."
bad,"when I was there in 2010, the management was horrible, The Met supervisors for the Met team were bullies, and didn't care your life outside the company, very unorganized, too much favoritism within the company"
bad,"I like to shop at Home Depot but I would NEVER work for their offices again. There's favoritism,and drama. The rules are inconsistent and sometimes seemed to be based off the emotions of the managers and supervisors."
bad,"I worked for Home Depot for six months and during those six months, my management had ABSOLUTELY no idea on how to perform my job, how to help me with my job, or what to do when things went wrong with my job. It was a constant struggle to do things when I was never provided resources to do them, (a forklift license, keys to certain storage areas pertaining to my department etc.). Then, to top it all off, when things went wrong in my department that were out of my hands, the management refused to help and berated me for any mistakes that happened, even I didn't do them. Overall a horrible experience in my department."
bad,Was there for 2 years and applied for a department supervisor position and they wouldn't even interview me for it the person that got the position I trained him and it was a huge let down when I was the one who covered shifts when people called out I would close the store and have to come in an open because the morning person called out I would never go back to working at the Home Depot
bad,"Management sucks they would never solve the problem when I would reached out to them for help! I was hired on the spot but never trained it's very stressing having to do a job where they don't train you properly, I was working  the service desk and employees where mean and would never answer my questions so I quit"
bad,Unless you are a high school kid or a retired  this is not for you. Entree level position with extremely low pay and horrible schedule. Close one night and open following morning. Should be some kind of law against treated fellow human beings like they do.
bad,They were like 6 managers and all have different opinions and could never be on the same page. I would only work Saturday and Sunday because they didn't want me to close. Learned to drive the forklift/stand up and cut wood.
bad,"Working there was horrible, it was a toxic work environment for multiple reasons, the management, the other employees, the customers that think you know the answer to everything and get mad when you don't, not to mention the literal toxicity of doing manual labor while exposed to toxic chemicals. The store manage is also a very angry and impatient man who insults his employees for no reason and tells associates that got hurt while working for him they are worthless."
bad,"Title speaks for itself.  Long long days, minimal salary, every man for himself.  Management makes knee jerk reactions and they have no clue the ripple effect it has on all the associates.  Any complaints are responded to with ""well you can leave and someone else will do your job"".  Brutal work environment."
bad,they are a decent company to work for compared to other companeys I have worked for.  they work you hard and also reward there good workers if they want to
bad,I don't really have anything to say about Home Depot. speaking from the viewpoint on Home Depot that is positive. either it being on the employee side or the customer side. neither one would shed any god light on the company and how it operates.
bad,"It's an okay place to work if it's not your primary job.  You can't depend on anyone to help you and you can expect to be thrown in to several uncomfortable situations on almost a daily basis.  Manager will not back you up, customers scream at you, coworkers are inconsistent.  You will most likely be working by yourself and be pulled in a thousand directions at once.  Scheduling is probably the worst, you will work weeks on end with an off day here or there, extinguishing any ability to have a life outside of work.  Feels very lopsided.  Easy to get fired."
bad,There is no follow up in the building. There is a lot of good workers leaving because they don't stand up for their employees. overall the work environment is not great like it used to be.
bad,"I took this job right out of high school. The management was weak and clearly indulged in favoritism.  I am only speaking for one store, so my review should be taken with a grain of salt."
bad,The job was one in which you would work harder not smarter. A job in which education was not need or used. A job in which danger was a way of life from unsafe safety practices.
bad,It’s not a job for a teenager or anyone who is looking to invest in this company. This company isn’t for me . I’m looking to grow in a company & advance also to challenge myself . & this job doesn’t do that for me .
bad,"With the proper management and benefits, this could be a great place to work. The way that employees are treated is ridiculous. They have the typical corporate mentality. They will not stand behind the employee even if they are in the right.  It is all about how much money they can make with the least amount of people working. Not a good business practice as customers get so frustrated and leave when they are no employees in sections to help them with their needs."
bad,was is ok manager didn't know how to make any choices to deal with the home depot management services was poor lots of product waste ended up throwing out way to much products
bad,This used to be a creative environment. Mgrs. play mental games. Liked the customers they were more respectful. Workplace culture changed HD fired employee weekly.
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. When i started this job i was told i would be full time and it was not. Managers played favorites with there friends and other associates when it came to raises and more hours.
bad,why is this a requirement to apply for jobs? some people want to apply for jobs not review old jobs. Can we live? Can we find new employment? I think this is stupid.
bad,"Unless you are an excellent ""brown noser"" stay away."
bad,"Management at home depot is very unorganized. They were always hiring new Assistant store managers, and in my 2 years there were 3 head managers replaced."
bad,"Management sucks they get stressed out for the smallest things and I think the main manager might be racist :( managers here need to improve with the customers and employees, they tend to be rude."
bad,"it would be a better place if they didn't just promote their favorites,people that work hard and try to do the right thing or make it better seem to get pushed aside"
bad,"I was not only surprised, but very disappointed in the lack of professionalism I observed and experienced at The Home Depot. Coming from a background of strong work ethic, formal training and strong managerial leadership I could not believe how this was not the case at such a large business corporation."
bad,worked as a customer service rep in the seasonal isle as part time. constantly told to keep helping the customer no matter the department but if I left my department to help a customer I would get in trouble for it. Promised lots of hours but I never got past 20 and the hours would always be at awkward times so i couldn't get a second one. took Cashier training to see if i could help cover some shifts to increase my hours only to be permanently moved to cash with the same hours as before.
bad,"The people staffed have little to no technical experience and can hardly fill out a service ticket. You are not promoted based on your merits. It's a social club, not a business. Some agents are temp workers for 2 years before they get promoted to Tier 1 agents. Some are promoted in 3 months just for who they know. People find fault like there's a reward for it."
bad,Too much stress... Never enough support staff... Management was complete .. Erratic work hours... Racial discrimination... What a  show... Would never work for again.
bad,Management sucks. They offer no room to move up. They claim they do but will never move you. Poor company. Hr doesnt do their job. Never get back to you & when they do. They dont care. They mess up pay & schedules real often. Company is just a joke.
bad,A typical day at work at Home Depot is fast-paced and stressful.  Anybody who wants a job there has to be desperate.  I learned that I didn't want to work there.  Management is poor at best.  Workplace culture allows for no friendship or fun on the job  The hardest part of the job is simply being there.  There is no enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"Working there were great, it’s just the managers that gives it a bad name, it all begins with favoritism and your hard work goes to waste, also the location were a hitch to get home"
bad,"Home Depot Exteriors outside sales position is a very stressful career choice. They changed the program. The bonus structure was cut severely and they do not want top performers or go-getters. They went to a new salesforce system. The result: Everyone is running appointments within a 100 mile radius of their base store.  Sales consultants drive over 150 miles a day for sometimes no compensation.  Sales managers promise high earnings, but reality is that after wear and tear on your vehicle you can expect about 35-45k a year.  This used to be a good career, but The Home Depot has brilliant managers in Atlanta that thought by cutting pay and costs, they can increase their bottom line. The other problem is that the installation and ordering process is broken,  You can expect mis-measured windows and roofs.  This delays the process, resulting in  upset customers, and you get paid months later. You are expected to work in the store for free to get your own leads, or get punished."
bad,"When I first started it wasn't that bad  but it just went downhill the last couple years .The management is the worst, the customers are from suck, people you work with are kind of okay. I definitely do not recommend working here"
bad,"Working at Home Depot only taught me patience. However the management and coworker were not consistent and did  not care what went on at work or personal life. As long the work they needed was done they could careless what else went on!"
bad,Home Depot is the last place I would return for a job. Management is constantly switching. You are merely a pawn in a huge corporation that is very easily replaced. Your opinions do not matter.
bad,"fun place to work at times, needs better managers and leaders in the company but I would never go back to work for them but there ok if you like that type of work"
bad,"Many illegal work practices happen at The Home Depot, bullying by the managers, and just the most disrespectful treatment of good hard working people."
bad,"a bunch of cut throat little kids. if you don't fit in, they, for some reason do not like you, they will find any way to either fire you or make the job so hard on you that you will quit"
bad,I did not enjoy my times at The Home Depot. It was a very stressful job with poor management and communication. I would never go back. I'm glad I don't work there anymore.
bad,"The management there doesn't care for the employees and that goes with your hours that you get how much you get paid or if your injured on the job. If you decide to go above and bey and try to move up the ladder the managers and department heads will take credit for your hard work and if you solved a problem for them, Managers get a 100,000 bonus check every year in December while everyone else gets anywhere from 100-500 dollars for the same work put in. The place is filled with drama and unnecessary involvement with each other it feels like high school all over again. I would not recommend working for the Home depot in Ontario or any other."
bad,Not the best company that I have worked for! I worked here many many years ago. So hopefully things have changed since then. Didn't feel like there was much room for growth.
bad,"They worked with my school hours, but overall, compensation was horrible and management  was lacking.  I worked there because I had to but would not recommend."
bad,not enough employees to get job done.  too much work not enough time to get the job done.  employees are not trained in the departments they have to cover.
bad,The management at my store is awful. They have got it in their heads that they don't like me so they are bullying me and trying to get me to quit. The job itself is okay because it's simple but the management WILL make your life hard.
bad,Don't work for this company they don't deserve your hardwork or patience management gives less then a ****about you.  If you work hard they tell you to do more work and if you work less you get warnings this company doesn't appreciate there workers management sits on there behinds and gets the bonuses you worked for and they didn't lift a finger.  They promise you a bright future and pay raises but let's be honest there's no future there unless you brown nose and pay raises is 10 to 25 cents a year
bad,"Very cut throat. Lack of any kind of leadership. Led via intimidation, finger pointing and back stabbing. No training except for watching some videos in the back room and then expected to know everything. "
bad,"I would compare it to WalMart, but atleast at WalMart you are allowed your breaks without being interrupted and their calling out process isn't as bad. I have never worked for a company that has such a messed up policy about calling out. Also, mangmnt has their favorites and the rest of you will be targeted. I was thrown into my position at the service desk with no training than what I got off the computer. My DH gave me a terrible review because I don't know much. Even when I ask her to train me, she refuses. Their reviews are a joke. They are so generalized that you are basically supposed to do everyone's job and go above that. Also, you don't get a raise after your 90 day trial period and when you are supposed to have your yearly raise, it doesn't come at your year anniversary. It's such a joke. The company tries to brag about caring for their employees but as long as they make money they don't care what happens to them"
bad,"The computer systems are stone age and the stock and order processes are even older. The Home Depot loves to remind everyone that it is a BILLION dollar company and yet ties the hands of Pro associates. For example, The products they have on the shelf are not purchased directly in most cases and you cant ""special order"" anything outside the website with ease. With the desire for growth being pushed in your face every second of the day, they sure make it impossible to accomplish sales tasks in a timely or organized manner. Extremely primitive mindset of management and sales resource tactics."
bad,"You drive all over to waste your time on bad appointments.  You are expected to work in the store for free to get your own leads.  They made it harder to earn a living by giving consultants a smaller territory.  If you make a small mistake on the order you lose all of your commission.  They do not want to pay the bonus so they are hiring 2000 reps nationwide,  Stay away!  You run all over the place for bad appointments."
bad,"Pros: its a very productive store and Benefits are good (If you can AFFORD). Cons: lack of hire for coverage, poor yearly raise, Highly favoritism, Rude and horrible Management, Over Working for short hours, stressful environment and can cause (damage to your Body)."
bad,There will be a lot of standing up in one stop. Must have customer service dealing with customer on a daily. Have to have a nice smile and enjoy your job.
bad,"Supports managers that are not following culture."
bad,I would never recommend anyone i know to work for The Home Depot. It is a truly sub par company. I fully regret ever deciding to apply for this company. I hope to not make the same mistake again.
bad,There are no words to describe the working conditions at Home Depot.  No one is trained in any department and you need to be available at any given moment to stop your job to help someone else and then be told you are now behind in your job.
bad,Better speak Spanish. Micro management. Don’t appreciate honesty and reliability. Customer is always right. Crazy scheduling. Enjoyed most of the associates.
bad,"Westerly, RI store is a HORRIBLE place to work. It is ""managed"" by a tyrannical woman who ""rules"" her kingdom by threatening and intimidating her subordinates. With a 50% + turnover rate and dozens of associate complaints filed against her, it is beyond me as to why corporate does nothing."
bad,"I was hired at Home Depot to be a head cashier. I excelled at this position enough that I was given a more challenging position. That Position was Customer Service. I was given very little employee help or direction. I would train an employee and then they would take them away, Then give me a unqualified person to replace them."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  I do not have anything positive to say about the company.  Therefore, I am not saying anything else. This is ridiculous that I have to continue writing"
bad,The management is terrible and does not treat employees well. The employees are overworked and underpaid. It is a terrible place to work. The only good thing about that place is the knowledge you gain from the products you are selling.
bad,if youre 18 and looking to start working its a great place to begin but i do not recommend staying here for very long. low pay in the long run and bad benefits.
bad,very poor management and poor opportunity for advancement.  pay is not competitive.  Leadership is very Lacking .  The company is not concerned with quality employees.
bad,This company does not value people nor hard work.  It's only value is to the stock holders and management.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Dept heads never did anything, unloaded there duties on me. "
bad,Not a great company it's going downhill. Big turn over and management is never involved. Too many kids working there and taking jobs real people whom actually need work while the kids just stand around all day and it's a huge rumor mill. Don't get sick and go on leave of absence they will terminate you almost immediately when you come back.
bad,"The Home Depot will teach you (through the use of in-store computer training) how to answer questions regarding which department an employee is in. "
bad,"It was okay, however work was slow and you would find yourself wandering a lot doing nothing. They did train you for long hours however it was not up to par."
bad,Typical night started at 10 pm and ended at 7 am or so. Worked overnights so it was very stressful to get everything done before the store opened in the morning. Management didn't hire enough people to balance out the overnight crew so there was more stress put upon the people there to hurry and finish.
bad,I disliked working three greatly. The management sucked didn't care about their workers unless I was just me. But overall would it recommend Home Depot to anyone.
bad,You have no holidays except Christmas off. The opportunity for advancement is slim to none unless you're a butt kisser. They have their People already picked to move up before the job is placed on the board. They pay by favoritism which means if you can be the hardest worker but if you're not a butt kisser you will get paid minimum I've been there for four years with great production but I get paid less than people been there half the time as me. They say it's a open door policy but when you come to them they hang it over your head forever overall just stay away this is by far the worst place in life
bad,"You would think being a cashier is pretty basic but when you start having to push credit cards, takes it to a whole other level. What you would expect."
bad,"The Home Depot Paint Department was very unorganized, they made me do management work and didn't promote me like they said they were going to, don't approve of their system at all"
bad,this was a part time position it gave me options to work with the public but no real room for growth and i choose to leave for somewhere with more pay and full time hours
bad,Always under staffed especially on the weekends. You never get your breaks on time and when you do they get cut short. The workers are always into your business and it feels like you're in a High school. I worked as a part timer and was doing full time hours without the benefits.
bad,There no job security and you don't get enough hours i am looking for a full time position but i don't know when is going to happen. The only good thing i can tell you is that the co workers are very understanding.
bad,"Sales and Customer service is the focus. It is a very stressful job between the often poor management and frequently rude customers. The pay is very low and it is hard to get raises of $1 or more. Only recommended if you want to move up in ranks to management. Otherwise the salary is around $10,000 per year."
bad,I met a lot of good people there.  a lot of good smart managers for the most part. The culture was changing as they were moving toward downsizing employee levels and building new stores. a lot of people were laid off
bad,"Work environment was results driven in a biased and hostile way.  Results achieved never considered the different aspects of loading, picking or transporting.  Pick per hour was calculated by a system that the managers relied too heavily on without considering lag time, wait times, and incidentals."
bad,"They do not care about their employees, see them as a replacable resource that they use up and then fire or drive off and replace with another. they treat older wiser employees worse and everyone is always trying to stab their fellow employees in the back to get ahead. They treat customers poorly,and only want their money but don't give a **** about them once they get it."
bad,"After 28 years working, I was fired for an unknown company policy to me, they hired a minu=imum wage no experienced person just to save money sacrificing quality service"
bad,I was working outside alone but not alone they had rats big huge rats and no manager would come help me because they had they own stuff to do as they say
bad,"Working there for 2 years and was receiving a low raise pay each year."
bad,"Bad place to work, customers were rude. customers would steal. no room for advancement in the store i was working. best part was helping the customers which was also the worst"
bad,Didn't understand a lot of what to do. They had training courses on the computer and I did not find it very helpful. Would of rather had someone showing us.
bad,"Fellow employees were pleasant management was horrible, i was accused of something she could not prove that I did so that is the reason why I ended up quitting and would never go back."
bad,"Store not managed properly lot of complaints "
bad,Nothing exciting . I went to work and did what i had to do . The management wasn’t understanding much . Overall working there was an experience itself but it was a lot of really rude customers thinking they can talk to you wrong
bad,The management was very rude and never looked out for its employees and would call you names in front of customers and also made customers feel like they do not matter
bad,home depot was a gross place to work with male employees stalking female customers and employees taking pictures and videos on their phones.Management & staff was too busy sexting to notice. Disgusting atmosphere
bad,really hard to move up with the company unless you know management. horrible hours and horrible schedule. it is a good learning experience but not a career job unless you are in the management field.
bad,"While working January on Friday night temps 10 degrees wind 25 mph winds so called assistant manager told me to dig out garden equipment and bring inside ,even though it was. Outside for at least 3full months,when I refused he went inside and told someone else to tell me I had to do it,well that was the last straw, I quit,  all the pre training that you get is bull, once you start work you see management didn't get same training,  management just doesent care about new workers"
bad,The employees at my store were well aware that we were replaceable and we did not feel valued at all.  No matter how much work you did it was never enough and the managers were always there ready to tell you just that.
bad,"They hate the handicapped, if you can't do one job, they throw you outside until you quit, it is a disgusting place to work, It is almost worse than Wal-Mart,"
bad,"nothing but ""the good ole boys club"""
bad,"Although the entire management team was replaced within a couple of years from my departure, the Sr management team had little regard for corporate SOP with no respect for department head/manager input nor fair compensation for exceeding goals while they reaped their bonus."
bad,don't want to say a thing cause I have nothing nice to say about home depot It was very stressful  Management picked there favorite and they did not care for their assocaites
bad,"A typical day at work is difficult as a part time, minimum wage college student in the silicon valley. Lets be honest, the cost of living exponentially exceeds the wage. It will be the hardest part of your life."
bad,Didn't like it at all would never work there again and do not recommend it to anyone at all. Worst job experience every. They do not care about their employees.
bad,"Awful place to work, management is constantly changing, high employee turn over and terrible workplace culture and work-life balance.  Minimum pay and you're expected to work like a machine."
bad,had to do all work and little pay and the cover up l assault that s done by there lp to make all paper work go away. they need to do better  such a shame
bad,"Terrible place to work! poor management, Terrible organization. Do not value your work ethic, but how much you can suck up! Unless youre desperate, I would not work here!"
bad,Working at home depot puts a strain on your body. Management would rather have a high volume of turn over employment then train people the correct way
bad,"Terrible management. "
bad,Home Depot is a horrible place to work I would not let anyone I know work at Home Depot. The managers are horrible they only hire their friends is not what you know it's really who you know and they don't show no compassion for your work ethic
bad,"Benefits are obscenely expensive, the call center is run with an unspoken favoritism policy.  They have a ridiculously juvenile practice of cheering out loud for the company."
bad,"It wasnt a bad job persay its just when you wanted to advance you had to apply for the position but the manager only ever promoted the people he was closest with. It was a tight nit family and he took of his ""kids"" ."
bad,Everybody that works here is racist. the management sucks and all the co-workers have a ad attitude. would not recommend working here. find a better place to work.
bad,The job was great but the lack of leadership and poor management is ridiculous. From trying to advance 3 times and the last time being told that i wasn't quite there yet but they would like me to train the person for the job i applied for. That there was enough and i left on my terms.
bad,The pay is not good and the management is not good. I work not recommend to work for this company to my worst enemy. I waiting for someone else to hire me
bad,Very bad management in the Saginaw Home Depot. Little to no raise per year while you work your butt off and the management get huge bonuses but you can bearly get a 50 cent raise.
bad,There was a lot of pressure because of customer satisfaction.  Customers became very difficult to satisfy if one was not informed enough about how to apply products they would complain endlessly.  I will not add any more information.  I cannot think of anything enjoyable about this job.
bad,I did not like it. My associates minus a few were awesome people however one manager harassed me all day by following me around. If I went somewhere sure enough he would be on the other side of a shelf watching me. Very creepy and very uncomfortable.
bad,I was in an operation supervisory role I was constantly getting contradictory direction from the 4 Assistant managers we had... The promotions were highly based on personal preference rather than performance.
bad,"Every one get alone with eachother, only reason i didnt like it was i wasn't getting any hours and wasn't getting paid every week. We where only gettig  paid evey 2 weeks."
bad,"This job is horrible. Cold warehouse, terrible working hours, terrible management, everyone is hooking up with everyone. Not many advancement opportunities."
bad,they were very easy to work for no complaints from me. they were the only one that can go out there way to helo and I loved that. I would work for them
bad,"home depot is a horrible place to work, they are more concerned with how much work you can get done rather than caring about your physical limits, they wont care about firing you if you cant get the work done."
bad,Working at Home Depot in my opinion is cut throat. It will keep you busy working there if you allow your job description too. Home Depot really isn’t a consistent job to work at for a long period of time without a catch.
bad,"Terrible place. Awful management. Terrible benefits. No health care benefits that was affordable. Pay sucked. Management retaliation was a major issue,"
bad,I worked in the home depot exteriors division where they lie to customers and blatantly sell less than adequate products to their consumers at top dollar. Shame on you Home Depot.
bad,"Low pay,advancement goes to friends of management. No health insurance for part time employees and you cant get full time from the start. Basically like Lowe's and every other retailer in the good ol USA."
bad,"I keep hearing the same old thing-it's not me, it's district that's making the decisions. Well, district needs to START caring about it's employees and STOP caring about the bottom line!! They are losing a LOT of great employees because of that!! When you invest in your employees they will stay, when you treat them like children and expect them to ""just do it"", they will leave. It's more beneficial in the long run to invest in them, then just ""spend money on them."" They haven't got this figured out and hopefully ONE day they will, until then, I would NOT recommend working for Home Depot-ANY of them!!"
bad,"bad management lack of training, lack of leads, did not give full picture in the interview, upper management no good, training was not real world revolving door of saleman"
bad,Too many people trying to stay afloat. very little chance to progress or advance. Too much favoritism. Not likely to work there again. It was a fast paced environment and management didn't seem to make it clear of what they wanted.
bad,This company lied. I was told the job was part time and hours were 25 to 28. I never got past 16 except once. This was a seasonal job. They are liars!
bad,"Lots of drama, low pay, hateful management!!! There's a mentality of buddy and clicks if you are not in the click you really go nowhere!"
bad,it was an okay job the enviornment wasn't that great but it was a good job didn't expect too much from it pay could have been better and the hours....
bad,"Could be a dangerous place to work. "
bad,"Never again! Management squeezes employees to a maximum. A lot of talk about work safety but in reality there is a total disregard for the wellbeing and safety of employees, regardless of their age or health conditi0n"
bad,A bunch of underpaid over worked slaves fighting for every hour no union they dont care about you all they care about is numbers and their product i hated it
bad,Lack of training they put you on the floor and expect you to move at a fast pace and know your job right away .Maybe other stores are better but I don't recommend the Coventry one.
bad,"There was no real opportunity to advance in rank, they don't appreciate their employees, and the pay was not worth the work you do. Most days would be stressful and not fulfilling."
bad,Put me as part time but worked 39 hours a week. Then I got fired while I was on workers comp. So I think that the management is terrible. I would never work there again.
bad,I got to interact with customers.  I provided extra help by showing them how to make an all out shopping experience.  Which means telling them what items goes with what other items.
bad,"After all the years of working retail and McDonald's I still managed to end up at another one, the home depot and after a year it was a year wasted . Yes"
bad,"Terrible place to work, almost all positions are part time, they put caps on salaries. very difficult to get a full time position. If do get benefits, they are not very good. Everybody who gets benefits complains about how terrible they are, very basic and expensive."
bad,"Not one good thing about this place. I drove forklifts, reach truck and order for minimum wage. All the managment were terrible and treated there employees bad."
bad,"No lunches, was part time with no room for advancement. my job was to clear out the back warehouse by 7pm, for when the fright team arrived to unload."
bad,It was okay starting out but after a while it starts to show its true colors. No real advancement opportunities in this particular store and not much pay on top of that.
bad,wast worth my time and energy as they just took advantage of me and mistreated the employees poorly store manager jimmy was nice and most of my co workers but leads not as much
bad,Not a career driven company. incredibly high turn around. management was hired on popularity instead of leadership qualities or work ethic. always understaffed so everyday working is the equivalent of doing 3 peoples jobs for minimum wage
bad,"I worked there in lumber sales first and then moved to overnight freight team.  They expect you, because they certify you, to drive all their equipment to move lumber, building material, appliances etc.  The responsibilities didn't equal pay which at that time was only 7.25 an hour.  At that time, they would terminate people for any little reason."
bad,Home Depot was a disaster from word go. The store manager was incapable of finding himself out of a wet paper bag. The management would constantly be on the employees. To give an illustration about the management. There was a ASM at Home Depot that had been with the company for 5 years all that time spent in south georgia. Snow does not happen in south georgia hardly.I remember getting in frieght the month of December and this particular manager asked with a straight face were are the snowblowers.
bad,"loved the crew , liked my department , good pay your uniform was laid back jeans  shirt. stocks options , taking pride in your work leadership moving up!!"
bad,"I developed arthritis in my back, but the company didn't lower my workload. In fact, it increased. When I complained to HR, they did nothing. I was told it was up to me to find help to complete tasks, but the staffing was always bare minimum, so there was no one to help. Management would punish you for not following policy and punish you for following it when a customer complained. They never have your back, and in several cases, set up employees to fail so that they can get rid of them."
bad,"poorly trained management. authoritarian and threatening style. bullies."
bad,"Jamaica homedeopt is full of gossip. You are able to get a good amount of hours thiugh, they do not play when it comes to time and attandence. The job was pretty easy though."
bad,"Could be a great place to work if Management was better.  Place is fun to work, especially if you like to talk to customers.  But, this job you get zero feed back for your work."
bad,"Managers are lazy and do not communicate, to those they are trying to terminate. I was so stressed out I had a heart attack, and then management really came after me. Not a place anyone should consider working."
bad,"Do not recommend working here"
bad,"My review was excellent and moving towards department head until I lost my job because I forgot to punch put one day.Not one manager stood up for me."
bad,assist customers with placing orders and picking up orders. Answer question about all aspects off the store. Unload trucks and stocks shelves. I enjoyed learning about the different products that home depot sells.
bad,"If you can keep to yourself this is a great place to work, however since you have to deal with coworkers it is very stressful, and clicky. The management stands up for the supervisors even if they are the problems... best to stay away...."
bad,"My time spent at Home Depot was horrible. I worked there for almost 3 years and never received a raise of any kind. I never got congratulated for any achievements that I did, even by saving the store tons of money from scammers and shoplifters. If you want to work in an environment where everyone talks about every one than this is the job for you."
bad,"My mother passed away and I asked for bereavement leave and they said yes, but fired me for absence after returning. Management showed favoritism to certain employees and didn't do well at training."
bad,"Management when I worked there was bad!! Store manager acted horrible towards people. Pay was horrible. Couldn't get any raises, or promotions. Co-workers were awesome people."
bad,If your looking for a temporary job then it may work for you but nothing more than that.  Pay isn't too bad but expensive benefits and no discounts.  Many issues are from poor management and lack of concern or care for the employees.  They say pride is a must but don't have any.  Would not recommend this place at all.
bad,"Once in a position, you can not move - the culture died off when the bottom line became utmost the priority over customer service and honesty in the store."
bad,"Great Customers, But Management Could have been much better, The co workers are really nice and understanding. Fun place to be at, at times and Home depot will also work with you on schedule changes if you need it"
bad,"Worked in both the stores and corporate office. Management favors those who do not have an education or common sense. It is hard to move up unless you know someone that can get you there. Low pay for specialists and hourly employees, and poor management support. Produce millions of dollars in sales per year and not properly compensated for the productive role in sales. There should be some sort of bonus scale or commission rate for the sales roles."
bad,"I busted my hump for this place working 10 hours strait without a lunch pretty much every day .. I can’t remember the last time I got a break for lunch .. I always did what I could for the job , stayed late , came in early , etc etc.. they let me go after it had gotten around the store that I was planning to leave in a couple months due to personal reasons . The environment quickly became sour and oppressive towards me and it was the worst thing walking into that place every day, the only reason I stayed is because I couldn’t afford to take time off from work to look for more work. Never work here, it’s like a high school and the employees are generally uneducated and petty."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at home depot whatsoever. The work environment required minimum safety procedures and I was hurt on several occasions. Finally, they do not comply with the ADA act."
bad,The job was OK... It is the corporate office that is shisty  and really doesn't  care about the employees  as much...  I was working with an serious health issue... And they didn't show any empathy or sympathy!!!!
bad,"Managers were awful, pay raises were only about ten cents a year, no advancement opportunity, terrible hours, unaffordable ""benefits"", no discounts, every employee was stressed and people quit left and right. They make you work four departments at a time because they don't want to pay anyone. Home Depot used to be a good company to work for, but they have changed so much. I was there a long time, but I finally ran out of there."
bad,Just overall bad place to work they do not care about the employee they just treat you like a number the have no respect for peopl you leave from work feeling like the scum of the earth
bad,"The schedule was ridiculous, I was scheduled in the morning one day and then the next I would be night time then the next week it would be midday and morning.  You could not plan your life around this.  They give no room for full time, no benefits, and very low pay.  In short, it was not the job for me and I did not gain anything by working there.  I have no more to say about it, this was not a good choice and it did not give me what I needed.  No benefits, low pay, no advancement."
bad,it sucks working at THD low pay long hours bad leadership no team work gossip back stabbing no loyalty from the company. Bi weekly pay sucks hours suck
bad,"the management they had was awful. especially the Store Manager. working there was really  uncomfortable. they say we a team and we work as a team but it isn't like that. everyone likes to start commotion and they made every employee feel like they weren't good enough, just because they were management and always made us be the bad person in every Customer that was rude or nice, especially in when the district people will come to visit our store. it was just drama there."
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for. Moral is horrible, work life balance is non existent to them and management is a joke. Half the time, management doesn't know how to do the work, or hide in a office goofing off with associates. No support for the associates. No job security, I've seen seasoned associates let go because something unexpected happened in their personal life that took them away from work. Their healthcare is the worst. The best part about that place, are the people."
bad,"No set schedule. some shifts starting at 5:45am and some starting at 3:pm. My sleep was so messed up. No set days off. Super under staffed, customers constantly complaining that there was no one to help them, I didn't know what to say to them."
bad,"If you are an attractive woman who wants to make a living there and not get involved with a man/woman there, do not work there. Harassment is severe and mgt/supervisors do not care. Mgt and supervisors do not like to lose their men and do not like the drama of complaints. I was grabbed by a man (mgt favorite)who thinks that women are worthless."
bad,"Well I just did this review on last one not sure whats going on here with this Auto Fill, however once again great place for kids and retired not a family business/income."
bad,"people were mean, didnt get paid enough couldnt get overtime. it was fast pace customers were very nice. workers were mean managment were rude. it was a okay work place."
bad,"I worked there for 9 years. It was one of the worst jobs I have had. Schedule always changing. Did not make it easy to enjoy life. One day i would work mornings, next day maybe nights and the day after that I work mornings again. Raises terrible."
bad,Working the evening shift and would notice that I would get in trouble for helping other employees while others were on break. It was a lot of back and forth with hours
bad,"I absolutely hated working here I was the youngest associate with full time hours but not full time pay. I was sexually harassed and assaulted and nothing was done about it, because it was my supervisor."
bad,Noticeable differences in compensation based on gender and race within the store. Pay grade will keep a person on food stamps even if they work full-time. No protection against aggressive customers. Cutthroat management.
bad,This was by far one of the worst jobs I've ever held. You're forced to work every weekend and if you need time off they give you a horrible time for it.
bad,"very bad culture to  work for unless you like to kiss but . Unless you are part of the click you will hate going to work. Managers are a bunch of kiss a.., Customer service means nothing as long as the managers reach there numbers."
bad,"I took this job because it was available. no other reason."
bad,"it was very boring, very repetitive, very inflexible, lousy benefits for part-time work. many frivolous and silly sop's. wish I could have learned more about hardware/building"
bad,"If you report company policy being ignored and you report it to management, it will be ignored and swept under the rug.  You can be singled out as I was and don't believe that they work with the handicapped because they gave me a very hard time and I've had open heart surgery.  They knew of my disabilities and made it worse.  I would absolutely not ever recommend Home Depot as employment for anyone."
bad,"I was a department supervisor so sometimes I received inside information. Other information was deemed top secret. Twice per year THD provided bonuses to employees based on years of service (any amount from $0.00 to $300.00. This benefit was touted by Managers and ASMs alike because they more goods and services sold translated to higher earning for management. Managers were interested in departments that sold services. One such example was hot water heaters. If a heater and installation were sold, the price of the water heater doubled. Buy goods at THD, but have them installed by independent contractors. You will save tons of money."
bad,"A typical day at Home Depot includes being ridiculed by your department head, and getting some kind of feedback from the management team.  The feedback, in my personal experience, was never good and it made me feel as though I wasn't good enough. I left nearly every day in tears."
bad,Not a job for someone who is looking for a career and good benefits.for someone  who just wants to get out of the house and have some extra money. the one thing that i did learn there was improvement of my communication skills also I met many great people that i now consider my friends.
bad,"The short time there, I had a great supervisor. how ever the staff was cutthroat and did and said any thing for advancement. there was hard working, friendly workers who deserved advancement but management only based advancement on personality without knowing what skills they have"
bad,If you don't want a career just a job it's great but if your looking for a career not the place to apply it is very cutthroat and unprofessional but that is due to the Managers there. Corporate has no ideal what is going on in the Orange boxes.
bad,The installation managers have entirely too much territory to cover to be able to supply the customer the grandiose fantasy onsite management they were being sold in the Home Services presentation.
bad,"The environment was awful, Not sure which was worse the "
bad,the job really doesnt support every employee that works there only certain workers if you dont fit a certain standard you get absolutely  no love you .
bad,This place was terrible it made me hate the company and the management was so bad and mean to its employees i really don't think i would recommend this to anyone
bad,I was hired as part time and they give you a hard time if you exceed your set hours. No overtime allowed. No benefits offered once I started working full time.
bad,I will never recommend anyone to work for Home Depot under it's current store manager at store 8954. I hated it! This store is poorly ran. It is constantly changing managers as well as associates.
bad,"The Home Depot is Not a company you want to work for if you're serious about growing with a company. What I have learn about this company, it doesn't matter which location you work at, the associate there never fail to gossip, throw people under the bus(including management) to save their own jobs. No one wants to take responsibilities for their actions. Low pay, no decent raise for the hard work you put out. There's a lot of favoritism, so you can't really get ahead like they say in their new hirer videos. The customer service is completely Horrible, and I felt so sorry for the customers while working there. The most part, you don't feel like your supervisors have your back, so you're left feeling stuck, hoping you'll find something better. Do Not Work Here. It's Not Worth It..."
bad,"mainly part time work with limited hours, start off pay is good , but getting raises or promotion depends on how well you can kiss butt otherwise you will be left on the outside crowd."
bad,Not a good place to work. Management are only concerned about making bonuses. Sorry employees are kept at the store while good employees are overworked and forced out.
bad,"Management is an absolute joke!! Their how management team is by far the worst kind of people you gave in these positions!! Simi Valley Home Depot needs new management. The simplest task, that a first grader can do, cant be done by management. I am starting to believe that the people within the management team in Simi Valley cant add 2+2, or cant even do the ABC song. Place is a joke!"
bad,they expect you to do way to much and if your numbers are below 100 percent they write you up even if they dont have that meny items coming down so it was not the best job
bad,would not recommend working here. The management is poor and they treat you very unfairly unless you kiss the managements butt. Not fun only miss my former co workers
bad,"The Management lacks simple communication skills, The hours are extremely unstable, pay is POOR, such a lack of advancement. The person in charge of scheduling, would schedule people 8 days in a row sometimes, merely because they have zero concern for their employees personal life and families."
bad,no comments will be furnished upon request. at this moment in time I do not wish to explain my bad experience at the home depot. I have no idea what this has to do with applying for a job
bad,as soon as I get back room is filled with freight never enough employees haven't had a manger in 7 months store manger is never there always pressing us to get stuff done when its physically impossible also there never enough equipment to get the job done
bad,This company no longer cares about its associates. It only cares about numbers and profit margin; it is not a professional work environment. Also no room to advance in the company.
bad,"Nice environment to work in, clean, nice people to work with Rest rooms clean. Hot but AC available. Great company to work for. Learned a lot from experience."
bad,I tried to give it Zero Stars but it wouldn't let me. that management is a joke. They lie to your face and talk about you behind your back. Worst place I've ever worked in my life
bad,My managers are racist white people who look down on their workers.  I got written up for going to get my freight cart from the back.  My manager always bugs the freight team rushing us to get done during business hours while customers are in the way and upset that we are working. MANAGEMENT is horrible and need to get retrained. I used to be a manager at 2 different companies and seeing how these people act is insulting.
bad,"No clue to run company , and treat employees. No advancement, stupid 3rd grade games that serve no purpose , management try to find reaskn to fire you and hire cheaper wage employees"
bad,"Been awhile since I worked here, wasn't a huge fan. I was undervalued and my ideas were not listened to often. Left to go back to school so I could break free"
bad,"Not the best workplace culture for me. Antagonistic co-workers at times, not much encouragement to help new hires successfully navigate the inevitable learning curve."
bad,Advancing at Home Depot isn't based on performance. It is based completely on who you know if they are trying to help you. There fore morale is low in those that do their job but don't have connections.
bad,Bad company not enough appreciation or hours for hardworking employees.Also a lot of favoritism I noticed as well. I notice a lot of employees don't help or assist customers when help is requested
bad,"Wouldn't recommend for employment didn't treat employee's properly"
bad,"I heard such great things from former employees about the management and benefits. Things have drastically changed. unless you have been fulltime for years, the pay is poor for the amount of work and flexibility required. If you don't say yes to coming in when they are short staffed, your next schedule will reflect their disappointment. Not professional at all."
bad,Don't work here.  Upper management is usually horrible.  give you unrealistic job duties and limited time to get them done on top of your actual job duties.  spare yourself and look for something better
bad,"I have worked in better places than home depot ,they never had enough workers to handle people. You would get put in departments where you had no idea what the products were. Like i would get put in plumbing when my original dept. was appliance sales."
bad,"Worst management I have ever had to work under. Coworkers are lazy and unprofessional. Management expects you to do the work of 5 people in different departments on top of what your daily tasks consist of. The hardest part was management being so unprofessional and poor choice in decision making. The most enjoyable part was me meeting my wife there. The culture here wasn't all that great, many conflicts and scandles unrelated to work."
bad,Managers of this company tend to delegate work to the associates rather than handle of themselves the work hours are terrible. And the compensation is terrible
bad,This establishment was an overall drag to work for. The customer service was awful and the management was an absolute joke. I would not recommend this location for anyone to work for or shop at.
bad,No training they will hire anybody but lack or guide for manager disrespect from management treatment not worth pay and no opportunity in the work place  favoritism
bad,Not a good company to work for. They care less about their hard working employees than those who can not and do not have experience. Management micromanage and two faced.
bad,After spending six months with them I've found that they are Not about a healthy work environment. I've come to find the management are friends with some of the employees that rant as hard-working as others and won't fire them because they are friends. I've heard rumors of management getting written up but they delete it out of the system instead of taking responsibilities for their actions. If you plan on going full-time think twice cause their actions and intentions will change towards you. I wish I could say they are great but I believe honestly is the best policy.
bad,Over all this company is not a good company to work for. They do not offer full time at all and their pay is terrible. It is hard to step up to the next level
bad,this place was very clean and nice to work for just not enough money for me to live on right when i bought my new home and i started to pay a mortgage. it was also part time and hours were getting cut all the time so i never had a steady pay check to live by.
bad,The shift times go back several hours each day and you have less sleep each night as you have to get up earlier each morning during your work week. Really bad.
bad,Management had favorites. No matter how much work you did it wasn't enough. You could do a great job on something and management would pick it apart until you had to start all over again. No recognition of work. Slave drivers.
bad,management in my store and they always appraised the worst people cause they sucked up to them but behind their backs they were stealing all kinds of stuff
bad,Worst place I have ever worked at everyone that works there has no knowledge of what they are selling to people. The management is poor and doesn't work to improve the store
bad,"Being a designer at a company like Home Depot where sales are down is particularly difficult at this time.  Managers have to answer to their managers as to why sales are down, and decreased traffic is not an acceptable answer.  "
bad,"not enough hours to live off of, management was horrible. the only good thing about working there was an hour lunch. you do not get enough pay for what they want."
bad,"Bad company to work, horrible benefits. Health insurance very expensive.....The pay is unfair and the job in the warehouse is fast and a lot of heavy lifting boxes."
bad,The job is not that bad. it would be alot better if they would pay you what your worth. Thet want you to know multiple departments and drive every machine in the building.
bad,"The average evening should look like this, but it doesn’t have to be exact. I’ll leave it up to your discretion regarding time management. I just need one “3d Patrol” per night:"
bad,"When you are a hard worker (like me) it is frustrating to see workers around you doing nothing and management instead of get everybody to work equally, they just call you and by the end of the day you are wasted."
bad,"This company is very disorganized and doesn't seem to know what each hand is doing at any given time. The compensation is not worth the long hours and upset/rude customers that come along with the territory. "
bad,"The balance of work/home life is sub-par, the pay is not that great, benefits are incredibly expensive. You have to fight tooth and nail to get a good schedule regardless of how you perform."
bad,"compensation for the amount of work required is not fair. managers do not communicate , absolutely no teamwork "
bad,My job was to unload and stock out i worked on the reach truck .and order picker the pacer and forklift now that job was a good place to work only reason i left is because I moved out of state
bad,"Customer service is top priority for floor associates, even if it means to break your back. Management team is a joke. Hard work for little pay. Favoritism is the only way to move up. Claim they care about their associates but rarely prove it."
bad,I did not enoy it at all. The work that they make thier employers do is just not right at all. Not a great place of buisness i hated working thier not recommended
bad,"A typical day at work you get treated like dirt by coworkers and even by customers, I learned to wear my heart on my sleeve and to not let people get under my skin. Management was terrible and they wouldn't give you time off when you absolutely needed it. Hardest part of the job was waking up every morning knowing you had to go there for a full day with small to no breaks."
bad,"I actually work for a company doing Home Depot deliverys we don't get paid sick time, we don't get overtime, we don't have vacation time and work 6 days a week"
bad,the job was the worst i ever hard they did not care that i had a brand new baby they fired me cause my child was sick and couldnt find someone to watch her.
bad,Working at this place was one of the worst experiences of my life. I dont recommend ever supporting this place. i was treated as nothing but trash wrost ever.
bad,"The only way to move up here is to basically make friends with everyone and turn on them, walking over their corpses to get to the top. People lie, cheat, and throw others under the bus."
bad,"I've been fortunate to have only had three jobs in my life, this is by far the worst. It's not enough to have a smug, corrupt, dishonest, incompetent, and nepotistic district corporate team, they have to pretend like they're the complete opposite. I really can not stress how terrible this company is, it's only saving grace is some of the store level employees and managers."
bad,"denial of respect for employees n customers, im a hard working individual who respects his job/ employees until i get treaded with disrespect then i look at it as a paycheck"
bad,Just not happy with the work environment and dissatisfied with the management team as well as the benefits.There is no room for advancement and raises with the company.
bad,Most stressful job that I ever had. Everyone is hot and frustrated the pay was 9 dollars an hour. physically and mentally challenging. We were always short staffed.
bad,They were prejudice towards me. Very unfair and treated staff poorly for no reason. I worked hard to get a promotion but they didnt ever get one. Others did.
bad,"When I was working there the pay was trash . After a week of work , not even a full week . My check was for 120 and this was after work taxes . You had people at job trying to tell you what to do and they wasn't even the bosses."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work for this company. The management team is horrible all around the broad, promotions are horrible as well as the work environment."
bad,"Working at home depot is an okay job. I noticed that working there they really like to not have people working full time, and hate giving out overtime."
bad,good company good benefits good managers everything good. just need to change career. looking for something that challengeing manaaging is okay just wanted to change
bad,"fun place to work"
bad,Too many irrelevant classes to take.  Schedule was constantly changing.  Less than friendly management.  Employees are not the top priority with Home Depot.
bad,"This company is possibly the worst to work for, they don't care for their employees, especially those who have worked there for an extended period. Their raises are horrible, recognition is nonexistent and advancement in the company is a joke."
bad,Management is full of broken promises and lies of opportunity. They preach advancement but will do everything to hold you back. Refuse to work with your schedule even if you have another job and kids yet they expect you to cover everyone's schedule. No communication from the top down it's a joke.
bad,"I'd just use this location as a stepping stone to something else. The pay is poor, good work is not recognized, people are treated poorly, and the management doesn't back their members."
bad,I have been working with home depot for over a year.  As I am not a favorite of the store managers I am not given any of the chances at the good jobs and they won't assist me with transferring to another store that is closer to where I now live.  If you want to make the least amount of money and get no benefits for it work at home depot.  Just don't trust anyone you work with its worse than high school how many people will try to get you in trouble.
bad,Just a horrible place to work. Most places were very disorganized. Very hard to find an associate and then when you do about half the time they have no idea how to help the customer. A lot of the associates don't do what they are suppose to be doing and very often do what it takes to avoid the customer.
bad,Good job for a high school or college student. This job doesn't guarantee promotions or growth within the company. Good flexible hours however that's always a plus.
bad,"company hires anyone place is ghetto and there's no loyalty here. You are just a number to them, the sups are horrible and this company is a liar. I would never come back here they have lied to me to many time"
bad,"Seven mile and Meyers is a horrible location to work, employees/management don't know how to talk to others and unprofessionalism in front of the customers."
bad,"if you like to stay busy and on your toes this is not the place for you.  you rarely get more than 10 people in your line, getting bored is very easy,but the breaks are nice and long!"
bad,"The managers harass you if you tell them yu don't wanthink to date them."
bad,This job is not the best job but it is something the management is very horrible and customer are very rude and disrepectful job needs to treat there workers better
bad,Being pallet builder at this place is by far the worst job ever. You spend all day building pallets and sweating. The hours are horrible and the pay is not that good.
bad,"no leadership, no advancement, horrible place to work. what a shame to work for a place like this!! no work life balance and leadership clueless........"
bad,"Working at The Home Depot Rapid Deployment Center were the most stressful years of my life. The workload only grew larger and more demanding as time went on and the supervisors were unsympathetic. Upper management constantly treated associates in a condescending manner as if they were children. The money sounds nice at first, but it is not worth the physical and mental abuse, and there is no job security."
bad,"I was a flooring specialist for this company, and was very vocal about the unfair wages at this company and they retaliated against me after 12 years of service.  The pay is horrible but the expectation is high. The workplace culture is quick paced, competitive, and cut throat.  I would not recommend working here."
bad,Heavy work load - did not want to pay what employees are worth. everyone is two faced and based action based on appearances and not factual information
bad,I was not able to get help to do my job it was horrible will never work for them again in my life. They have no concept of how to organize the man power.
bad,"its a high school environment and manager don't a care about you. it all politics, manager stepping over employee's. they put too much pressure on you and not enough paid. not worth it."
bad,"They treat employees as cattle. The spend more time telling you how great it is to work for them then actually doing anything to benefit the employees. They openly mock employees and there is no respect. No health insurance (its offered, you pay, if you wanna give up your whole check). Don't even offer an employee discount."
bad,"I worked there for years, ran several departments responsible for things that I was not being compensated for.  Was asked to per-mote to Supervisory position so that the company could justify my pay, at the particular personal level i was in my life i could not, and was not ready to move on.  In the end they let me go, and it was very unprofessional the way it was done."
bad,Management will work you like a dog. Treats you unkind and unfair. Management will give you the run around about promoting you. Full time is not offered.
bad,If you do not fit in you will not advance.  As is with every Home Depot.  Everyone is sleeping with everyone and cheating on their spouses/significant others.  Definitely do not live by their no retaliation policy.
bad,"I was going through a lot while I worked here, so a lot of it had to do with mt attitude, but the people were very click-ish. I was not one of the click,so it made this job intolerably uncomfortable!  "
bad,"Unless you work for corporate I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Horrible management, they don't keep up with paygrade. They are rarely willing to give you a pay raise."
bad,How hard is it to read a resume and or application to determine what hours a prospective employee is available to work?  I made it clear on my online application that I had another part-time job and could only be available during certain hours of the day.  The interview I had was over in five minutes after I was told the hours they really needed people to be at the store.  But they knew that when they granted me the interview that I had another job.  I don't like having my time or my gas wasted.
bad,"Mangerment does not know how to treat their employees.They like to yell at their than just trying to be nice.when you clock in they start yelling and normally will tell you that they need you to do their work,"
bad,My experience with Home Depot was not a pleasant one.  At first they are all about training but it falls to the way side.  You must have  a cold heart to be a supervisor there because they do not care how things are processed to employees they just want it done.  When you do go to HR with issues they just get swept under the rug
bad,I hate going there but it is a job. I was an absolute fool to become a Missionary for the General Conference of Seventh Day Adventists. I would have never considered working there. Staying on your feet  all day is a crime.
bad,HD does not have competitive wages for a merchandiser. Especially since it is alot of heavy lifting and very dirty and also very dangerous.  MET manager had no integrity.
bad,"Was laid-off after injuring myself at work. No workman's compensation, horrible management, favoritism. Awful employer to work for, glad I'm out! Don't bother working here!"
bad,they don't pay good at all and its really hard to become full time its really a waste of time working at home depot at least the store I was working at
bad,I have enjoyed working here because have gotten to know a whole lot of good people but the advancement opportunities are just not here for me! Learned many skill can carry forward to my new career.
bad,"the work Environment at home depot is bad they have no core values that they say they have the leadership is some of the worst I have ever seen at any job I have worked at, there is definite favoritism the job is not hard at all but the Environment itself drains you each day"
bad,Overworked/Underpaid - not enough employees there.  Had me doing the work of 3 people.  Only paid $10/hr for laborious work.  No room for advancement.
bad,"Helping customers in garden/ seasonal, cooperate with co-workers, self time and task management, dealing with rude, angry customers; meeting and exceeding expectations of customers."
bad,I really enjoyed working at The Home Depot. The customers were very pleasant and the overall work experience working there was great! Management was great and the most enjoyable part of the job were getting credit cards and the Customers.
bad,"Home Depot was requiring straight commission sales people who were hired for outside sales to spend time in their stores, representing the company as a hired paid employee to find their own leads.  We were required to behave and act like we were store floor personnel and help customers around the store.  There was no compensation for time."
bad,"long hours not a lot of time off, when hired for the freight position you are a temp for 120 days and then they decide if they want to keep you for me it lasted until shortly after the memorial day holiday and then they decided that they didnt need me on freight anymore."
bad,management stated an open door policy but it came with a price trust no one its a click job.never had i seen a company that did not care about certain employees they picked who they would help. if you were not in the click your life there was made to suffer only 2 managers were amazing.
bad,u can learn a lot but don't try to make this a career..... workplace cool but boring........ nice girls lol mgmt sucked a lot starter job good for teens
bad,constant changes are difficult to manage due to the lack of training or actual time to complete the training required to perform your job effectively.
bad,"cashiering front end at store, helping customers check out merchandise ,management is okay, stressful when busy, interacting with customers is the best part of this job."
bad,Not good! If you escape with your self esteem in tact you are ahead of the pack. Managers are taught to play the blame game and will lie at any chance to put their short comings on their direct reports. Managers take credit for your good work and blame you for things they did. It is across the company.
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone low pay , bad hours ,unreasonable expectations , no benefits,no holiday pay ,wildly erratic scheduling very poor work life balance"
bad,They don't care about your well-being or trying to pay you a fair wage for the kind of back breaking work. backstabbing its like going to highschool everybody is snitches and b.....thes.
bad,"The do not care about you they only care about themselves Mgrs do not want to help you when needed pay is very low,  To get them to deal with a customer is next to impossible"
bad,This job was great loves to go to work got all the hrs I needed and if they needed me longer if stayed. They always had the best parties I mean everything was great slowly by slowly everyone started transferring to different home depot or quoting all because we got a new manager. I didn't think to much about it thought maybe things will stay the same WRONG my hrs started getting cut because I wanted to work and go to school manager didn't support me going to school so he cut my hrs so I had to go.
bad,"I loved my customers that came and shopped with me daily, the managers in that store the new manager is unprofessional and not liked at all.  I Wont look back."
bad,I worked here as a lot guy and i absolutely hated it. They give great hours and the staff were okay however the customers were what made it the hardest to work there.
bad,There is too much favoritism and politics at this store. If you are not in the in-crowd you are not treated good. You will get push aside for a  promotion if they like someone better. I am good! I don't think I ever want to work there again. Maybe if I had to though.
bad,If you like sneaky snakes go ahead. The management cares more about making their life easier than they do associates own well being. Lame attempts and trying to relate to or boost morale are more like slaps in the face than they are helpful.
bad,I had a shift in the morning and it was stressful being that co workers where broken into personal groups and managers showed favoritism. I was not happy working there.
bad,"Home Depot wants to pay you $10 an hour to run the whole store and to work your tale off. Even their assistant managers work extremely too much and have no work/life balance. When you work at Home Depot you better be prepared for it to consume your whole life and get to spend no time with your family. They do not recognize the hard work either, they just take advantage of it and continue to ask more and more of you. Worst company ever to work for."
bad,"I applied Online, did everything, the assesments and all the steps, so i got an email saying that i was schedule for friday at 3:00, so i arrived there around 2:30 and wait a little, when i get the chance to talk to the one that was suppost to interviewing me, she said ""i got bad new""  you was schedule for yesterday at 2:00 couse a ""job fair"" WOWWW they never send me an email, the never call me to tell me they reschedule me... if there not organize and that serious about the interview i dont want to imagine the rest.... i will never try again on Home Depot, i was so exited then desappointed..."
bad,A temporary job for anyone looking for something to help on the side. People who make careers here move up swiftly and those who are left behind are miserable everyday.
bad,I would not recommend this employer if one is seeking a a career. I would hope that there are better more authentic retail opportunities that actually value its employees.
bad,"I have been here a week and already have found this to be a messy chaotic work environment, Management is nowhere to be found and workload exceeds the amount of pay involved."
bad,"Horrible service and i know because i worked there for 4 years. All floor associates dodge customers and management throws the customers toward the floor associates whenever they need help or assistance. The Home Depot is a joke. The job security is horrible and they will fire people for no reason what so ever, i've seen it many times with my own eyes."
bad,"Home Depot one of the most stressful jobs I ever had, they make you break your back, and push sales but don't care about their employees. Wouldn't recommend to anyone to work there. You have customer constantly yelling at you because quotes aren't up to date but and get no help from anyone"
bad,"A lot of my coworkers are kinda downers. They make the day drag longer, and management is a mess. I like some of the other cashiers but they like to try to not work. I don't mind being in the Garden department during sunny days. A lot of the associates are really late and favoritism plays a big role in the day."
bad,"Horrible company to work for,  they don't care about their own people , If your 18 & look for just a summer job then it's for you, but don't make a career out of it , work for the summer & move on  quickly.  There's no union  in that  Company & this is something you need with them ... Know one to help you out , when dealing with  shoes with the management team. Don't  waste your time calling corporate doesn't help .."
bad,"Management is horrible, They take advantage of the employee, unorganized, Short staffed, Supervisiors changed over 3 times within the timeframe of 4 months"
bad,i help lots of people with merchandise and help contractors with lumber   and push carts help tack out tush.helping out in the store and baring carts inside the in the winter. and lining up carts in the front  of the store and tacking carts in side for customers.
bad,"The worst experience I've ever had, basically treat their employees like slaves, management played favorites, raises were never implemented, if you experienced harassment there was no use in reporting it as nothing would really ever get done."
bad,the job has so many rules and regulations that the bosses dont follow themselves. they love to feed their staff. but once again all the bs that goes on there is not worth your pay.
bad,The company is OK as a whole but no one communicates with each other you can get harassed or talked bad about and no one  would do anything about it I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
bad,"This was my first job, and without a doubt one of the worst. People would say horrible thing about the customers, employee theft was a big issue, people were always dissatisfied with the service, and management didn't care at all about the employees."
bad,I traveled a far distance for this interview. Upon arrival I was told there wasn't any interviews schedule for that day. I showed them my email confirming the time and date from HR supervisor. I emailed the HR supervisor about the issue. I never received an email or call back about the inconvenience. I properly prepared to make time for this interview and to found out my time was not taken in consideration is very unprofessional. It is very clear The home depot is not worthy of my skills and talents I can bring to the company.
bad,"A lot of fights and arguments "
bad,"Very unorganized "
bad,Very disrespectful and unwilling to teach someone who is new to the job. I did not feel welcome what so ever at this work place
bad,This job was All about who you know and favorites. The employees do not care about the customers at all. It was a whirlwind of horrible management and supervisors.
bad,"unless you follow the cliques, then you we will outcast-ed for not fitting in. Everyone there is need to babied. The hours where horrible, the management didn't do anything for the staff."
bad,The job is located in Marietta ga.  If you are coming in as a contractor it will be a long time before you become permanent. The working environment in this small office building is terrible.
bad,"I loved my job here when i first started, good managers, work environment with good pay for a college student. Flexible schedule and bonuses every six months"
bad,They had a lot of people standing around on some days and on the other were extremely under staffed which was frustrating
bad,"Would not recommend working there. It is an awful place to work for. They over work you and you do not get paid for anything you do, the managers get the money for everything."
bad,"poor treatment of employees, minimal training of management, minimal training of employees, basically only learn as you go, and almost impossible to document disabilities that arent noticeable"
bad,The employee is not valued or compensated properly for the amount of work expected. Very low morale at the Parker store.
bad,you have to work really had and get a bad compensation. I would work for them again only if the pay was moved up. mike uranco was the store manager.
bad,you will work and be over worked on the night shift they want the store fully stocked and not settling for you coming up short so you will work with minimum help
bad,"I hated working at Home Depot because there always drama going on and management did absouletly nothing about it."
bad,a typical day is stocking and shelving as well as basic customeservice during operation hours. other shifts included the same thing but during non operational hours
bad,"The store manger buys drugs off the employees ""Steroid's"". if home depot is a drug free company he should be fried. he sleep with all if the Female workers.     the hours suck, you cent a day off family, they only like carnet people there."
bad,Not a place I would recommend for anybody. I worked vary hard for years and been held back so much. Staff was not friendly and vary rude. Management doesn't care about no one.
bad,"everything about this place suck. after being hiring it took them three my to put my into the system before i could even start training. when i started i didnt in have manager, i had to learn evrything by myself"
bad,"This location, and for the company now,  has no concern for any of the associates that work there.  They've really taken a turn for the worse the last 16 years.  Voice of the associate and customer are a joke here.   If you're smart, you'll pass on this company as a career."
bad,they adverstise that they honor veterans but they treat veterans like trash. In order to get advance the asms have to vote on who get full-time. not good
bad,"No communications, no praise, bad pay. I have been moved departments without warning three times with no training and no former, if any, consultation."
bad,Employer doesn't reward loyal employees and is concerned with the bottom line and profits only. There are limited options for advancement.
bad,had  a very bad experince with this compant they didnt want to teach u anything made u learn everything on ur own never wanted to work with u with ur family
bad,"Zero over-time, the management was terrible. Most of the time you are in danger of being struck or hit by vehicles. Very poor work environment. Highly dissatisfied."
bad,"For part time Cashiers, it is extremely difficult to manage another job along with working here.  They want massive hours when they need it, and cut them when sales go down."
bad,I was offered a full time job and never got it even though I worked there for 4 years after I left the first person they hired was given a full time job 2 years later he retired. I was not treated the same way as other people.
bad,Management at home depot is very unorganized. It is almost impossible to advance with the company. You could learn a lot skills and meet a lot of different people.
bad,"Expected to work every weekend and holidays part time.  Requested one weekend off in six months and was cut from 38 hours per week to 20 hours per week.  They showed me exactly how they respected their part time employees.  If you like politics at the workplace this is for you.  Qualifications mean nothing.  It's all about who ""likes"" you."
bad,The company was not worried about the employee or helping them grow within it's structure. They seemed to only care about getting the the new customers and we're not concerned with repeat business. In a small town repeat business is crucial to success. Employees were on average only there for six months.
bad,My first store I worked at amazing loved it... now I'm in a new store new department... trained me on nothing I get written up over stupid things they should have trained me on but didn't and bloody head cashiers and managers can be really rude and unhelpful. I find they get mad over things that I can't control as well as they believe they trained me on BUT DID NOT... never get a weekend off unpredictable hrs
bad,Daily duties were to complete all paint orders as well as stock and inventory. Customer service was a huge part of my duties as well which included even loading the customers purchase into their vehicle
bad,24/7 work attitude for the least amount of pay including exploitation of workers selling a dream but in actuality recycable employees mentality for a company being the top 10 in American companies when it comes to the most revenue you would think that they would treat their employees with a high standard the reality is they don't care at all and will burn you out to the bone and spit you out and to them its just business employees deserve a job with dignity.
bad,"Customers are stupid and rude.  Coworkers are lazy and stupid. Corporate policy: if someone steals anything and you try to stop them, you're fired.  You can work your tail off... after a year, a dime raise."
bad,"RUDE unprofessional office manager. Facility manager unable to lead his team almost afraid of them."
bad,"Expectations are beyond comprehensible !"
bad,"They treat people like dogs. If your in the in crowd you can do no wrong. They state they have an open door policy and you can say anything. However, if you say anything, they open the door and give you the boot. Management is clueless. They are out for themselves. They treat you like a dog. They expect you to work off the clock. They interoupt your lunches and breaks. If your lucky enough to get them. Hey if your a smoker it's great. On an average all smokers go out several times a day to smoke. It's especially nice if your department head smokes. Because you can join them. Or enjoy the peace and quiet while they are smoking more than working. Also, you have to beg for commonly used supplies, i.e.: toilet paper, hand soap, pens, paper and ink for printers."
bad,"Top Store Management ignored safety of employee and customers, and made it policy to let thieves walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then tell you you're up for a raise but then say they don't have the money. Yet the managers get there bonus."
bad,Good people are passed up for promotions. If you are good looking you get a promotion. You get thrown under the bus for the management problems.
bad,no room to grow. mangers always angry. always cutting hours.they wont work with your school schedule even though when they hired you they knew ahead of time about the school schedule.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at store 3632. Management is not fair at all. The hardest part of my job each day was dealing with my superiors. There were a lot of double standards. Policy was carried through to the letter for some and policy was not carried through to the letter for others.The inverted pyramid concept is a falsehood.
bad,The pay doesn't add up to the responsibilities. You cannot survive on $11 an hour. They have the part timers working minimal hours and as a result the full timers are overworked.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at The Home Depot. Morale was always horrible, management clueless, and the pay was not worth dealing with the rudeness of impatient customers."
bad,"Management is extremely disrespectful to the sales associates, the pay is a joke, and they are extremely dishonest to their customers. Fortunately, Lowe's is easily accessible one exit up."
bad,"This company depending on your location is a hit or miss. The management is very bad at the Covington Georgia store. They fired almost 50 people in 3 weeks and after working there for 2 years, I quit from overworking. The day I quit I was working 8 departments solo."
bad,"I would handle complaint of customers that order got messed up, sales, returns, renting out the truck. Management was a joke. They would never help you when you needed it. Co-workers were friendly. I enjoyed helping the customers."
bad,"This job took hard work to the extreme with unloading of various heavy items from trucks, to then assemble them onto a pallet, then wrap them.No benefits of any kind & pay was horrific. One has nothing to gain working in this environment for there is virtually no room for growth & most of the workers are foreigners who barely speak a lick of English. Not a good place to work in the slightest."
bad,"My overall review of the Elyria Home Depot is very poor. The managment team does not know how to work together, and overall does not care about their employees. I have worked there over six years and am making as much money as a new cashier. I believe they do not know how to give the proper raises."
bad,"Terrible, laziest management team on the plannet never do anything don't help costomers complain when store sale reports go down an blame everyone esle"
bad,"it was poor, management overall i disliked it cause they didnt know how to take care of there costumers and i feel like thy need more experience on what they are doing"
bad,I don't like it. I couldn't advance in my career path because of favoritism. Management was horrible. Experienced discrimination while working there. The pay is not worth the amount of work being done.
bad,Had to unload truck by hand and stock shelves and had to keep giving great customer service on part time hours. (27 hours or less) Would not give me more than 27 hours and I didn't get a raise until we were short staffed and 2 months later after my yearly review
bad,There is absolutely no communication to employees or any flexibility in working with employees with families regarding hours .I was told matter of fact by a Store Manager and Human Resources that those are your hours. Take it or leave it. We have hundreds of applications on file and you can be replaced in a phone call.
bad,On your feet moving for your entire shift. I learned a lot - I feel confident to install tile myself. The hardest part of the job is the hours worked without enough coworkers to handle the demand of customers.
bad,"no hours, they dont keep their word on whats offerd when they hire you terribleeeee"
bad,Management is horrible and treat associates like children.  the company has lost its family orientation that was emphasized so much by the founder of home depot.  it has turned from family to corporate greed with a slave mentality.
bad,Management doesn't take care or support it's employees. Not enough cashiers to take care of the customers. Not enough employees for the whole store.
bad,"management did not respond to associates concerns. management showed favoritism towards certain associates. hired new associates instead of promoting or moving existing associates. hourly supervisors have no power or proper training. very poorly run store. i wanted to work for home depot for a long time and was very disappointed with my time there. when i put my notice in to quit, nobody came and talked to me to see what they could do to keep me, nothing. they do not care about their associates."
bad,"if you didn't read my review on H&M, do it. They are basically the same company. they try to brain wash you into believe you're having fun, and you don't hate the job."
bad,Working at Home Depot sucks. I worked in the parking lot where it was super hot 24-7. Plus carry heavy things also sucked. The company overalls is a good company if you are into construction and what not
bad,it was terrible and a very bad place to work. management talked to you like you was a child and the work vs life is terrible. would not work there again
bad,"Unprofessional, hostile environment for a cashier. Most of the employees and managers are amazing but there are a few supervisors that will go out of their way to cause trouble for you. The front end supervisor of the Danbury CT store 6209 is vindictive and will do what she can to inject herself in your personal life. I have been working at the store 2 years, have never been late and have never caused any problems at work but have still been targeted by her. Cashiers quit this job left and right because of this behavior. There is non stop gossiping and inappropriate behavior by the head cashiers and this specific front end manager. They will skip your breaks whenever it suits them and stop you from being promoted. I gave a lot of my time and time and energy to this company and was still treated like trash. "
bad,terrible treatment of employees in Onalaska WI; believed a supplier without any other complaint by another person or company.
bad,They hire people only for seasonal so please stop saying your job secure that b.s. manager dont care about how employee do a great customer services. Training for the company sucks they throw you in the floor and u need to learn on your own. I can tell you by first hand experience.
bad,"I have worked in the Natick, store. don't work for the company they not care for the employees. all the care is the customer and that it."
bad,Home Depot worked with my school schedule.  That is the only positive thing that I can say about Home Depot. I met some amazing people and got to network.
bad,"As an employee at The Home Depot store number 6351, the store manager and the entire management team is horrible. There's too much favoritism in the store and it is forever short staffed due to the ASDS depending on ""The System"" that makes the schedule. The management team tends to intimidate the regular hourly associates and it is just unfair."
bad,"Company does not care for workers, first thing you are told is that you are expendable. I only worked here long enough to find something better."
bad,Mangers did not follow SOP as the workers were trained by so that mad working little messed up some times.. And working on the over night team plus not getting paid for travel time...
bad,Works with the general public in a retail setting. Usually very busy every day. Nice people work for home depot.Management is usually only looking out for themselves.
bad,"Management over looks issues installed by mid-management, such as no assistance during peak business periods. No coverage for lunch breaks."
bad,"Terrible employee attitude throughout the building."
bad,to them you are replaceable and they can get someone to do your job for cheaper so they don't care. Raises were horrible too.
bad,Management treats you terribly and they only focus on the customer.  Sometimes you are the only person in the department on the busiest days.
bad,is at the i pierre job twitter cat dog house home burger alert dinner breakfast lunch bench and a bunch of other things
bad,working at the home depot was a disaster no mgmt. control and customers there were rude because manager allow them too typically a day at my location was rough always busy and no added help to fulfill the needs to operate your dept as needed
bad,fast and busy work place that you can moved up in different positions. the company has a lot of different opportunities and different programs
bad,"Home Depot is not a place to advance and gain in pay. They underpay their staff and their benefits are not affprdable. They are a big profit business for their stock and share holders. They have no genuine concern to keep employees on the job. They have high turnover of employees, and run short staffed almost always."
bad,totally whistled at by men every day yes I am pretty but its a horrible environment its like a mating call fish market fest they want to pay you good to work your feet off and at the end of the day you go home and your soooo EXHAUSTED you can barely stand up
bad,The upper management treats everyone like a number and is only interested in their own interests.  I was a call center supervisor there and you will not be treated fairly or as a person.  They cannot seem to keep any of their managers due to how they treat all of their employees.  My two cents is stay away!!
bad,"I wouldnt work for them again, the management is very bad and they abuse their workers by low pay and trying to avoid paying them and using them whenever they need them, stay away from home depot."
bad,management is unsupportive and does not respect the staff the make it really hard for you to do your job. My experience working there was very negative
bad,"I loved it there fast paced... stayed busy, enjoyed customers and coworkers, management was great!!! Enjoyed working the garden area especially on a nice day. I learned at about tools, wood , molding. hardware items that I didn't know before... which helped me along the way everyday."
bad,"The open door policy seems friendly but it's really a way to identify a complainer and start the retaliation process."
bad,"They value customers more than customer service, and expect you to just take customers' verbal abuse and say nothing. They will take the word of a customer over the word of an employee. Lying and backstabbing are very common. Trust nobody at Home Depot."
bad,"If I could give them NO stars I would........"
bad,"working hard on typical day, learning different jobs. working well with co-workers, hardest part of job is not being able to be productive at all time. i enjoy getting rewarded for doing a good job."
bad,Never work at the home depot on 87th they're jerks and uneducated fools. Never become an lot associate. It isn't a easy job because you get no HELP!!!!
bad,i would never work here again they promise you the world and start giving you hours then when you finally start feeling like you are making headway financially they cut your hours by more than half. also the supervisors take credit for all of the hard work that you put in to make your department look good. again i would give less than one star if it would let me.
bad,Very enjoyable atmosphere with a great collective of people who always support and help you. I am very happy to work in that place.
bad,"It is shocking that a company like Home Depot would treat their employees like this, but if suckers are desperate enough to fill the positions, they'll keep taking advantage of them.  The job is 100% commission.  You don't get reimbursed for gas or mileage, which can be over 100 miles per day.  I wasn't reimbursed for when I fell down a customer's stairs and tore my pants.  I wasn't reimbursed when my car was almost towed and he had to get paid to lower my car back to the ground.  They want you to work in the stores, but won't pay hourly.  You don't even get reimbursed for when they send you to bad leads/appointments.  The better leads (most likely to sell) are cherry-picked by the sales manager, which he drives to in his leased Mercedes."
bad,seems good when you are sitting in orientation but after you have been there a while you begin to realize that you aren't going anywhere there and hard work is not rewarded with better jobs. Human Resources does not do their job properly and shows little regard for the employees.
bad,Working for Coaxum Enterprises was amazing. I was able to grow with the company. Learning the management skills I so use today in my work and home eviornment
bad,My sales manager is a lyer.He didn't know anything about the job we do.They lie about the projected salaries.They say nationally and that doesn't mean here.The leads are horrible.The lead center enters in the wrong information about the customer.The sales manager manipulates the leads.This is the worst job I have ever had.I spent more money than I earned.It is 100% commission and no base salary.I do not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
bad,"Previous manager was great and I loved the job.  Then they brought in an inexperienced manager needing to prove himself.  The culture of the location is VERY political.  The manager would fire at whim.  Everyone was a target.  Management played team members against one another, so you could trust no one to support you with any issue.  Everyone was out to keep their job and would attack other workers to keep their position.  VERY bad work environment.  No advancement unless you were chummy.  Fired every employee as they got to $10 per hour. No full time positions."
bad,buena empresa pero los altos mandos se meten mucho en tu vida fuera de la empresa y no hay oportunidades de creser por la falta de profecionalismo de los gerentes y personas con puesto alto puesto que ellos deciden quien sube de nivel la capasitacion es buena el anviente de trabajo es malo se vive en tencion la estavilidad laboral es mala puesto que si le caes mal a los de arriba te sacan sin motibo alguno obio te liquidan pero no es estable muchas deficiencias y anomalias en sus contratos muchas vilaciones de la ley federal del trabajo ejemplo te obligan a salir de vacaciones cuando ellos lo indican en secciones de 6  dias y tiene que ser en dia lunes despues pasa un mes y sales otros 6 dias obio en lunes tiene que ser despues ya puedes escoger los 2 dias que te quedan pero la ley marca que es tu dercho salir los dias que te corresponde si serseccionados y dice que el empleador puede sugerir que seccione los dias de vacaciones el empleado mas no puede obligarlo y alli en home depot nos obligaban si queriamos salir nos davan un calendario que ellos hacian y si queriamos salir teniamos que firmarlo para poder tomar las vacaciones que nos corresponden por ley el dia la fecha y los dias que nos indicaban los gerentes de rh dehome depot y asi surgian muchas anomalias si pedias copia de tu contrato te despedian cosa que lo marca la ley el empleador deve de proporcionar copia del contrato una ala junta de conciliacion y arvitrage del estado donde se encuentre la empresa y una copia fiel al trabajador y la original se queda en la empresa cosa que si la pedias te la negaban de echo
bad,This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had! The management is really bad. Employees are overworked and under payed. There is a lot of favoritism.
bad,Not much to say about this particular job. The pay was not worth the labor and the headache. Also the Hours were terrible.
bad,"poor H.R. and management (looking at the other reviews this is far beyond a trend ) wasn't given a chance to shine. was promised a call or email weather or not I got the job , only to have my status on their web site say "" status pending for three days "" for over a month. pay attention to these reviews so that you are armed (with lipstick) . happy employees come from GOOD management and that trickles down to happy customers which makes RETURN cutomers (this is why lowes is gaining speed ) which makes happy C E O . but they don't care ...their salaries don't drop ."
bad,"Poor management. Co-workers got away with many things, managers never anywhere to be found. Do not recommend working here."
bad,"management is very poor.  no people skills."
bad,Cashier in garden department or front store. Worked morning shifts. Sometimes closing shifts. Kept work area clean and provided great customer service.
bad,"You will not advance if one manager does not like you. To advance, you don't have to be a hard worker. Just stand around and talk with management all the time so they like you and you will get promoted. The job is way too stressful for what it is. The amount of stress you are left with, you might as well be a brain surgeon."
bad,"Job fantastic with new management transferred from other stores.  New management created from existing associates with no experience in management, change life balance."
bad,Learned some product knowledge. It used to be fun. The worst part is the co-workers. Lots of people with drinking problems and negative attitudes about everything.
bad,No set schedule. Unable to balance life and home. Good training if your able to get to it. Not enough employees to do a great job for customers. People who worked at home depot were unhappy due to the same reasons above.
bad,"pay was horrible. early mornings were horrible, people were not intelligent at all. job was mediocre at best. pay was terrible. part time to prevent benefits. nothing good about it."
bad,"They don't care about your well-being, they will take advantage of your kindness, and they will fire you on the spot if you don't agree with what they think is right."
bad,"The management did not know what others management was doing. "
bad,Constantly short staffed and unwilling to increase the number of employees working to improve customer satisfaction.
bad,"Hostile working environment with a passive aggressive attitude towards it employees."
bad,Not a good company to work for. Workers are over worked(hourly employees). Salary positions are treated better but the little guy is not.
bad,"work well with others, Help run the company. Unloaded and loaded up trucks. i handled all of hazmat materials. Great customer service"
bad,"it's a job, but that's all, sporadic hours and schedules, little opportunity, very political, hard on employees, very demanding"
bad,"no job satisfaction. micromanaged, the benefits are sub-par. hardly any chance for advancement. no support from management."
bad,"It's funny how the company expects us to be to a master plumber or electrician and offer a slightly above minimum pay. "
bad,not getting paid enough to stand their and deal with all those problems people come in having. And the managers hardly help either.
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. They treated everyone under the age of 24 like serial numbers and fired multiple people in large sweeps for client needs.It was inhuman. It was a terrible chain of command and it was extremely hard to work there.
bad,"I contracted with Home Depot Home Services for a roof repair. I had a plethora of issues starting with they mismeasured my roof and told me I would need 10 squares when the job took less than 6, they scheduled installation 7 different times, they do not return phone calls, and finally showed up at 6:30 pm on a Friday night to start the job. They completed the installation more than a week ago"
bad,"I applied for part time position on overnight shift. When I had the interview with the store manager, I was told it was going to be full time so they can evaluate my performance. Right before I was due to apply for benefits my hours were cut to 1 or 2 days a week to prevent me from receiving benefits. I am now back to full time schedule because open enrollment for insurance has ended and I am being forced to work full schedule again with no benefits. I was Told during interviews and orientation what a great company it is, all lies. They said I would work two week rotation on weekends and had to work overnight weekends for six and a half months.I was the only person forced to work every weekend. I was told that there is no seniority and everyone is treated the same - another lie, I was told bonuses were so big that HR manager was able to add extra space to her house just by bonuses and stocks, another lie.  I was told you can get promoted quickly,more lies. After my hours were cut they hired two people full time for overnight shift with full benefits and never asked anyone if they wanted to move to full time schedule. They only promote people that kiss up to senior management. All of the awards go out to people that are friends with their bosses or store manager.The break room has vending machines that are never stocked with food and they charge double the price. I work overnight and doors are locked so getting food is near impossible at 2 o'clock in the morning and I only have 30 minutes for lunch. I was put in outside garden and had to work in the rain with nothing to protect"
bad,"work/life balance not there"
bad,"management was poor, they pick favorites and stick by them, they don't pay much , they don't care about the associates they never have an answer and this store has a high turn over rate"
bad,The only good thing about working for Home Depot was some of the people there are really nice and good honest people.  Otherwise stay away.  Management openly plays favorites and genuinely do not care about employees.  The monetary compensation is awful and not nearly good enough for the amount of headache that one gets from the ridiculous policies and treatment from Management.
bad,This position was not hard at all. This is the type of position you would get if you want to do something to pay your bills without having to work so hard.
bad,good place to work but no opportunities to keep advancing in the company. the weren't as understandable as an employer should be.
bad,It was boring.  You might get 12 hours a week.  You were only hired for 120 days at a time.  There are no benefits.  There is nothing to learn.  Management is cold.
bad,"I enjoyed the pay I was getting, but my manager wasn't supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
bad,"vary hard work with low pay, no pay incentives and impossible to advance in jobs. enjoy working with my co-workers and the management is not bad either. applied for 3 positions in store and was turned down all 3. there is not room for advancement even when the position is pretty much handed to you"
bad,"managers don't know what they are doing, they aren't very safe managers talk about you behind your back. Managers are never around when you have a problem. HR doesn't do anything with when you tell them about any problems that you have with another associate."
bad,"At home depot we receive the pallets of good pre arranged in the mornings and they are sorted and processed throughout the day. We at night then proceed to move the carts to their designated location and off load and stock the shelves in each department. You are rarely given a sick day, but when you do you might fear your job is  in jeopardy. Many a night I spent stocking 4 department only to find other employees have only stocked half a department that should have been quick. The turnover rate is ridiculous, the management is beyond saving, and a past greedy ceo ruined a great company."
bad,the Associate's that work with you are awesome. a typical day will consist of helping out customers and stocking store shelves. I learned a lot about helping people make key decisions for helping them figure out the housing project's.
bad,I hated working here the managers were very strict and excepted everyone to be working even in down time you should be restocking or making it look like you are fixing the shelves
bad,"works well with a school schedule, for the people that are trying to better their life worth and make more money."
bad,no room for advancement. employees barely get any hours. only brown nosers get the option to move up within the company.
bad,"	Conducted the procedures of opening and closing of the facility."
bad,"A typical day as a cashier was working either at Self-Checkout, Garden area, Returns and the Pro desk."
bad,"This is a place to learn how to interact with customers one to one. Also a good place to learn to drive equipment, such as a fork lift and other equipment."
bad,I lived at Homedepot for very little pay I was insulted by customers bullied by staff and over all had a bad time working there. The training was inadequate and they put me out on the floor with little to no training . I am glad to be out of their employment
bad,Working at home depot in capitol heights was not good at all. The management team was not great at all. They can not own up to mistakes.
bad,Days varied sometimes we as pro associates were left to deal with upset customers due to other problems in the store. over the course of seven years I saw the culture go from caring about each other to watch out for so and so.
bad,the hours are so sporatic and varied you can not even get another part time job and they limit you to 25 hours a week. it was a very bad place to work and they do not appreciate their employees just care about how much they can work you and pay as little as possible.
bad,"And the award for 'The Shadiest Cheapskates To Work For' goes to.......The Home Depot!!! Congratulations, you are ranked number one! For your ability to sleep at night knowing, and doing nothing about how underpaid your workers are! Also, for using your employees like disposable scapegoats. You've mastered the art of distraction by presenting the 'customer first' image while continuing to walk all over the millions of people that keep your stores running. The ones that keep money in your pocket!Awesome business sense Home Depot! A+ Corporate American Goofs"
bad,"Complete garbage. Absolutely the worst company i have ever had the displeasure to work for. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS."
bad,"Company does not staff adequate people on the floor to provide good customer service. Was injured and overworked on the job, so I left to pursue other interest."
bad,the job wasn't the issue the fact that no one who was in management knew how to execute their job accurately. more of the leads were acting as managers and the supervisors were way better. favoritism is how you move up here. store in oakwood plaza in fort lauderdale. but maybe another home depot will be better
bad,Make sure that cashiers have everythin they need as in bags for customers and money to complete a transaction.At the end of the night take all the money out of each register and deposit it into the safe.
bad,everything about this job was terrible. I will never work there again. I don't suggest anyone working here. The staff was rude. There is not one good thing I can say about the company.
bad,I njoyed working with the customers and helping them I njoyed I working with the managers n co workers I learned how to use codes top ring up items the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customes but I learn how to deal with them and make them happy I enjoyable part of the job helping the customers and making them happy
bad,"Its fast paced work with heavy lifting but management and promotions are hard to come by it starts to seem like high school with the childish attitude of management."
bad,Great good place to work for but the advancement was not too slow but didn't  pay its worth. Great helping customers analysis there problems and helping them make a fix.
bad,wouldnt work there again i really loved the job i was never out always did my best i stayed over when needed and come in when needed i felt like i worked very hard and did not deserve what i got some of the employees there now are lazy and did nothing but they were rewarded for that i fell like you have to do other things that i dont agree with to make it there when i was hired they told me that i would not be let go without a 2 week notice the whole time i worked there i was bragged on by bosses there was some issues of wrong doin but when i went to management nothing ever got done and is still possibly going on i felt like i worked hard for nothing i went there to better myself but instaed i got hurt
bad,"I was let go on the 89th of my 90 day probation period with no reason other than they just needed someone to get them through their busy period. I asked why i was being terminated and was told ""we are not here to discuss that"". I think in the managers office, being terminated is exactly where that should be discussed. Supervisor sent unsolicited emails to my personal account to ask for favours."
bad,Arrogant confidence is what managers use as their SOP. If 1 word were to describe the experience it would be this: CRAZY.
bad,they dont care about anyone in parking lot if you a lot guy. well get ready work bone off and find out they dont care anything about guys out side
bad,"The job itself is okay, but I feel as though I don't get compensated for the work I put in, and what I do is not appreciated at all."
bad,"love to work and satisfy the customers needs at all times , always listen the there description of there need first and then solve the problem to satisfy there needs"
bad,"often times I can't take a break because there are not enough employees to cover my break let alone my lunch.  I felt I had to be on call, your work availablilty need to be open 7 days a week 24 hours a day.  My work schedule would change the day before and the pay rate for a supervisor is below industry standards."
bad,really not a place to look for a full time job. everyone is part time. management has a lot of favoritism and the hardest part is dealing with the customers.
bad,"Management from the top down have no clue about the people that work for them. They have no idea how much work some do and so little others do. They praise those who are not productive and punish the others. No overtime, no raises, and only part time positions."
bad,"this job had to be the worst job I ever had management was horrible the only thing good about this job was the workers,i learned absolutely nothing there ,would advise anyone looking for this job dont"
bad,typical day at work was judgmental people. always pointing out your flaws. I learned how to do nothing. but was forced to do everything.
bad,Wonderful People and wonderful employees ! Definitely somewhere to work if you like interacting with people and working retail!
bad,I would not recommend working at home depot. Management lacks severely and employees are not treated with respect or dignity. I did not enjoy working at home depot
bad,I have learned new skills that will apply to any job referring to customer service. I learned how not to be socially awkward working at a place like this and grow to like customer service
bad,"micro managing, minimum wage, 4 hrs week, management will yell at you in front of customers, discrimination from other associates & management and overall not impressed.  Ever wonder why the have 4 job fairs year?  The turnover rate from one store in Calgary has to be 10-15 quit every month."
bad,Home depot is fast paced. employer's do not value their employees at all. Customers are disgusting.badddddddddd jobbbbbbbbbbbb!!!!!!!!!!
bad,no full time no medical no salary increases until one year. and what they are offering after one year is not worth waiting for.
bad,i was pregnant while i worked here and they had me moving heavy duty items and i worked late nights i also got robbed on the  job and they still made me work didnt like it
bad,None of the management team introduces there selves. Because everyone is hired on a temporary basis.So they see no need because nine time's out of ten you won't be there after 90 day's. Then if you get a permanent position and receive a promotion to department manager. Your ASM say's I didn't have anything to do with you receiving your promotion witch leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. and that they are so confident in your ability to do a good job. Then after your department turns in the best numbers in the store after inventory shrink. The only one that said good job was the other department heads and one ASM that wasn't even over your department. So you tell me what do you think of Home Depot so far.
bad,"Worst company I ever worked during my entire adulthood."
bad,Long days and long hours nothing be negative vibes all around. I'd rather work at lowes atleast their healthcare plan covers illness.
bad,"Very very very very very stressful and uncomfortable!!!!!"
bad,"pay too little for a lot of work, higher management favor others based on friendship."
bad,"staff incompetent , careless, no interest in plants, management not interested in working with others, no plans for selling plants, go to lowes"
bad,"Home Depot used to be the employer of choice. BUT in the past year, it has become oppressive and threatening. Management is constantly waiting to point fingers and lead through intimidation. Every staff member now comes to work dejected and paranoid."
bad,Low low pay. They will give you multiple shifts in other areas but still pay you as a cashier. unfair conditions. don't work here. go to lowes.
bad,I can do my job better then my supervisor. Safety and SOP are not taught and trained to employees very well. I would never recommend anyone work at Home Depot.
bad,"this is a survival job."
bad,When I first started working at home depot everything was great but soon after they had new management. Then everything went down hill fast. They started firing people and giving invalid reasons for letting people go. Almost everyone quit from their poor management.
bad,"a typical day in the delivery dept. would consist of pulling orders for the Pro truck for that day, orders for the next day and online orders that stop you from pulling next day orders. people in the depts. would not pull orders from their depts. also, delivering orders for that day by going on the road in the pro truck. they really need depts. to pull orders for next day if there is no overtime or management needs to step up and have someone pull the orders."
bad,Management does not know what they are doing.  Everyone will tell you to do something different until you get fed up of their incompetence and quit
bad,"Maybe it's just me, but this was probably the worst place I've ever worked. They put me in hardware team, and I love hardware, but we always got 1000 calls a day between 5 am and 7 pm. Always 1000 calls. How many people did we have? We were lucky if we had 25 people. Other teams that handled software had 40+ people and only handled 300 calls a day. "
bad,"Home Depot is a good place to work.  I have learn many things at the Company.  Being a Cashier, Inventory Associate, Merchandise"
bad,"Management favoritism and pettiness and an unwritten policy of acquiescing to all customer wishes no matter how stupid, poor pay, written up for following proper procedures. Nothing matters but the bottom line. No one has your back when dealing with abusive customers. Store manager took three weeks to introduce himself. Not introduced to key personnel in store. Left to your own devices to figure everything ""out on the floor"". Lack of business best practices....could go on and on, but the bottom line is ""Living the Orange Life"" is to guarantee that you have no life at all. Company needs a UNION to shake it up. Might be biggest Home Improvement Big Box Store at the moment but is heading in the wrong direction. Poor place to work if you have a clue."
bad,"Exciting and rewarding work environment. A atmosphere is customer friendly."
bad,this place will take over you life and drain al your life from you fast as you turn into an orange zombie and serve rude customers when they can find you
bad,too small to hold inventory.  Always crammed full and disorganized due to vendors forcing inventory that would not fit and did not sell.  limited small items that were important for jobs just because they weren't big money items..forcing customers to go elsewhere.
bad,"they pay less than all competitors, offer no compensation for appointments that may take you 2-3 hours of drive time, they constantly try to find ways to take your commissions away, the install department is terrible and you lose sales because of them .... Management could care less about anything but numbers, and basically the turn over rate is so high there is never anyone in any dept that knows what they are doing,customers are treated terribly -  just a terrible unorganized environment, run from this job there are far better companies to work for"
bad,Woefully understaffed and not enough recognition.  Management needs to recognize others for their efforts and not just their favorites.  Home Depot is turning into a high pressure sales environment.
bad,"ok job to work at. management was a con"
bad,"A lot of customers are in your face and will not take no for an answer, having to keep your cool is a must."
bad,Company was slow in the winter so hours were cut all the time. Worked extra hard in the summer with no breaks sometimes. the employees didn't work well today.
bad,"Deluded people who believe that the company is worth working for going on the reputation earned in the 70's. All benefits require you putting money back into the company, ie share discount. Got the best dental insurance co-payment was $300, no employee discount however you can knock the price down $50 for any customer, also proving the stuff is overpriced. My bonus check aka success sharing was a massive $18.00.My Manager was former military draftee who acted like a drill Sargent and grunted when ever he asked you a question then ignored you. The worst company I have ever worked for, and will never go into a Home depot ever again."
bad,"If you like no respect for your time, expense, you will love working for the Home Depot. Management is disorganized at the training level. Management expects you to stand around the store 25+ hours a week with no compensation. The store associates know almost nothing about product, except a few who have some tenure. Their lead generations is poor at best, no leads no sales!!!"
bad,"Almost no chance of advancement, and the management it a joke. Unless your become friends with the managers then you are treated as a god no matter how terrible a worker you may be.Never work for this company."
bad,home depot was okay at first until the supervisors started treating us like trash and talkn to us anykind of way. except this one supervisor who i respected so much cause he was the best but he moved to another shift and thats wen my shift started falling apart. so i quit
bad,The worst place to work in they give no hours and don't care About you the supervisor and manager think because they have a higher position than you they can treat you like garbage
bad,"I Really enjoyed the ""ya never know"" factor bout thia work enviroment the people who tend to breach thease store seem to all shae a since of buisness ony savey ."
bad,"poor teamwork. everyone seems to be all for themselves but will work together if it benefits making the company name remain in good standing. other then that, forget it !"
bad,"If you enjoy standing on hard concrete floors 7-8 hours a day, then this job is for you. The company does not hire full time and you must work a full year before you can qualify for benefits."
bad,"I got treated  differently from  management, other employees.  I had two break downs at this location because I got treated like a slave."
bad,"A large corporation, only worried about their bottom dollar.  The pay sucks, just over minimum wage even for people that have 20 years of experience.  They don't want to hire anybody full time.  Managers are encouraged to keep as many people part time so they don't have to pay benefits.  Management is always trying to make them selves look good, especially when they have a walk and higher ups are coming for a visit.  They say the company cares about you, again a bunch of BS.  I worked at 3 stores.the first sore the whole management team sucked, the 2nd store was ok. the 3rd store the management team was ok,except 1 ASM was great. very nice, very fair and a great sense of humor.   Management will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat.  They all have their favorites.  If you are an associate at Home Depot you should always be watching your back. No associate discount.  Honest repeat customers get nothing.  The  idiots that make a scene and throw a tantrum practically get stuff free."
bad,This was not my favorite job. The management team was not very good. The job in general was not something I would do again.
bad,Its a bad jobs over all the customer are rude and the management are bad on trainning
bad,It's a very good company. Great schedule/good benefits/learning new things as time goes on in my work day. Helpful co-workers and fantastic management team to learn from. Overall a Great company.
bad,was told in my orientation for a department head position that the company expects you to put in 60 hrs worth of work into a 40hr work week.
bad,"They hire you as a W2 employee, straight commission, but do not treat you as such.  You are expected to lie to get the sale closed the same day for $20,000+ jobs and are given no contact information for the customer.  They post numbers that employees who are going through the initial training see that make it look like everyone is making very good income.  Problem is, if design consultants get a customer to sign, but the customer is not approved for credit, the design consultant makes nothing.  Yet, that was still counted as a sale.  It is very deceptive.  Also, there are laws that straight commission sales people have to make at least minimum wage.  I spent a lot of time and money driving up to 2-1/2 hours from my home for almost 2 months and made nothing.  We were also expected to spend a lot of time in the Home Depot stores trying to get leads for no pay.  Yet, we had to wear Home Depot aprons, which made customers constantly come up asking for help.  So, basically, Home Depot got free labor from us.  The sales managers hire way too many people for the number of leads they get and then only give leads to their buddies.  You are expected to be at the office for mandatory, unpaid meetings several times a week.  You don't know what your schedule is going to be like from day to day.  You don't find out until anywhere from 11 pm the night before to 7 am the day of where you are expected to be for the day.  It makes it very difficult to plan your life around this.  Finally, the customers are getting prices for new cabinets in the Home Depot Stores and then, when HDI design consultants"
bad,"I work there for two and seen three different store managers, every time one gets fired its like a complete reset for all the current employee it doesn't matter how much you have accomplished before you have to do everything over again if you to stand a chance working and you know that new store is going to get fired in a year or two so he/she doesn't care about you or anybody else they'll fired you for any reason to keep their jobs. I work in every department and all kind of shift still I haven't move in the company yet."
bad,A typical work day at home depot is based upon servicing the customer in a timely fashion .  I have learned the aspects of shipping and receiving as well as making sure the customers orders is correct before being shipped. My co- workers are very helpful and reliable and also work as hard as I do to make sure we are performing our job safely as well as servicing the customer . The hardest part about my job is the labor. The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing that the customer has been serviced at the end of the day.
bad,"The deadlines are unrealistic and not based on how long the work will actually take.  You are expected to work extra to make the deadline, even if it's months of 70+ hours."
bad,"imagine having 6 different managers giving you different tasks on the complete other end of the store.  then, they wonder why its taking you so long."
bad,"Managers were horrible, it was all favoritism if they didn't like you they found any way to fire you"
bad,"I have no comment so I will refrain from posting, Home depot has lost its values of doing the right thing."
bad,Phone interview went great for a cashier position. Face to Face went great. The question  dealed with how to treat customers. I got hired on the spot and got sent to take a drug test... Then received a phone call 10 minutes later I couldn't get hired because I worked at a different Home Depot which I never did... They lied to me and made up a excuse to pretty much fire me.. Then on the spot.. Very disappointed.
bad,"the old days were better• 11 years in customer service"
bad,"The job itself is not bad at all, it's mainly the management. They don't value their employees."
bad,"Management doesn't know what they are doing:"
bad,they only like to hire part time so they dont have to pay associates too much money. they are always hiring and barely giving you hours
bad,I learned a lot about being a cashier and what that position consist of.  I also learned a lot about the products that we had throughout the store. I got to learn about a lot of new products and what they capabilities were.
bad,"applyed many many times and never a call back or email. Hr promised a call back and never happened. They don't hire veterans, only say they will for business genrator purposes."
bad,bad not for a family or make money not a good company how they say
bad,they require too much from their employees for what they were paying
bad,"A typical day at this job was you had to work by yourself while helping a lot of customers with no help. Management was horrible at their job, co-workers never helped all they would do is goof off while I would be stuck doing the workload that was given to them. The hardest part of my job was getting my co-workers to help me do the jobs that were necessary and management would not do anything about it. There was absolutely No enjoyable part of my job except the fact that I would meet a lot of new people and get to successfully help them with whatever it was they needed."
bad,"A typical day at work was taking the long walk to clock in before you were written up for being one minute late. Then, finding out who called in sick so you could figure out how busy you were going to be. "
bad,"working for home depot was an eye opening experience"
bad,"I gave everything for fourteen years, then I was given the door."
bad,"poor heath and safety practices "
bad,I worked in every department and acquired and mastered each section at Home Depot.  It was a lot of work being on your feet on the concrete floor for 9 hours.  I was certified to use each machine the company has.  I left to further my education to financially support myself and my daughter.
bad,Assisting customers. Co-workers are decent. Hardest part of the job is working the night shift.
bad,A typical day at homedepot consists of assisting customers and completeing your daily check off sheets. I gained some new insight on building and construction projects from the regular contractors that come in on a daily or weekly bases. I cant speak for all management in the overall company but in the store that I worked at management deminstrated poor comunication skills and in my opinion could have had stronger leadership skills.  The fellow co-workers were very plesant to work with and helped the work day go better. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers and the pay and benifits that the company offered was very poor. Not a job you could live comfortablely and be able to pay your bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you worked with.
bad,"Your work day will be standing a lot, however you learn a lot. Management are not flexible with you and some co-workers will work hard and some are lazy. The hardest part of the job is to carry heavy boxes sometime and the enjoyable part of the job is when it's time to go home at the end of the day."
bad,"typical day at work consisted of helping customers, making special orders, and maintaing a communication with other departments."
bad,"Home Depot does not care about its associates.  Management is only out for one thing, to increase their own bonuses."
bad,"Associated not treated fairly, efforts  not appreciated. Management not the best"
bad,helping customers with demands such as cutting lumber to there demands.  using a variety of fork trucks to move stock and move it around the store.
bad,"The company as a whole is garbage! Poor pay, poor benefits and only the brainwashed are advanced. Management is two faced and only looking out for themselves"
bad,Liked the place. great if you like short hours and no room for moving up. managers have no idea what they are doing. alot of drama
bad,Worked at a fast pace environment. Learned to work in various departments. Gained great sales skills. Enjoyed the customers
bad,"Terrible management and there IS favoritism."
bad,Fun store very friendly work place a..my coworkers very very friendly and clean store
bad,"Assigned a area for the day, have a $100 drawer for the day ring customers up at end of shift count money and send to vault."
bad,"I have met some very wonderful people at The Home Depot and that's what makes the company wonderful. They are thoughtful and display a sense of family."
bad,"I worked here 4 years, every year my raise was 30 cents, and that is the highest you can get.  Knowledge and skill gets you nowhere in this building, I've seen some of the most intelligent people I've ever met be fired for something ridiculous, and I've seen the least knowledgeable associates move up because they ""rubbed"" a manager the right way.  No job security at all, they need a union, and if you do something to anger a manager whether personal or not, they will watch you like a hawk and fire you for a rule that is not even generally enforced, even in front of a district managers presence, which can be extremely confusing and aggravating.  From my own personal experience... Apply here as a last resort"
bad,I hate it. They do not accept your availability and deny your requests to change your work days.
bad,"Management was very passive-aggressive and caused a lot of drama within the work place by talking about other members of management or other employees to the rest of the building. The pay is low and they do not schedule according to anyone having young children or families (although in the interview, they said they would). I would work nine days straight at times. The co-workers are great people, I made a lot of wonderful friends there, but management was utterly awful and made each work day a real struggle to get through."
bad,Plenty of training. Anyone could play a management role. Some good people work there. Knowledge was there for employees.
bad,"High stress environment, poor support, two-faced and backstabbing management. If you value your sanity and soul do not apply."
bad,Cashier at home depot is not a job you want they give you all the pressure to sale and up sale as well as credit cards and everything is placed on the cashier and no pay increase
bad,"I was hired as a cashier, was expected to work like a man. Lifting heavy merchandise, going get the carts outside in the heat, cold, or rain. Benefits sucked. Pay sucked. Hours sucked, only giving me 20 -25 hours a week. Management / supervisor over the area I was at had his click, and if you're not a brown noser, you wasn't in his click."
bad,i got fired for having pneumonia ....and hospitalized .. and i will never shop their again.
bad,"I provided telephone support for Home Depot Store Associates. I addressed a variety of issues related to software and hardware (printers, faxes, Point of Sale systems, scanner guns, mobile devices) in the store.  Supporting Store employees across the US and Canada."
bad,I would not recommend this place for employment. There is no room for advancement. They only hire part time workers. And the part time benefits are not that spectacular either.
bad,"Worked very close with the merchandising department,"
bad,"Corporate hole, George Orwell never would have survived. Hostile work environment, to anybody with a disability, anybody of a different ethnic background, anybody with a different gender. I was seriously traumatized by my time there. my parents were alcoholics, and i never understood any possible motivation to drink myself stupid(er) and numb until i worked at home depot. i will always hate and cringe whenever i think of my time there."
bad,"Boring place, standing on your feet all the time. Rude customers and management."
bad,"Never get a job at Home Depot! No hours, manger look at you like your suppose to be happy with 15 hours a week. BAD management!"
bad,"Typical call center 2nd shift no Sundays one day off a week. Poor and non-existent supervision...always at meetings, no training on computers or new software."
bad,"A typical day at work would include completing check lists, being a team player, interacting with the customers while maintaining the quantity and quality of the paint ordered, and making recommendations to DIYers who wanted to repair such things as bath tubs and decks. "
bad,Not a good company to work for.  They do not work well around your schedule and do not give requested time off.
bad,if you dont know anyone youll be disregared as a human being.
bad,The day shift wasn't bad. Working the freight shift from 9-1 in the morning wasn't fun at all. The whole team is very disorganized and the manager is very disrespectful.
bad,The managers do not know what they are doing half the time.  Plus they like to promote people to positions that doesn't make any sense. They also do not care about there employees at all and their personal lives
bad,"If quotas are you thing, then go do LP at Home Depot. Quotas became the biggest problem working here."
bad,The Home depot is only worried about selling a product without the pleasuring or ensuring a great experience. My time working for The Home Depot was bad. The ASM's don't even put in a effort to work with co-workers to make work run a lot more smoothly. Out higher ups are unreliable.
bad,Management cares only about salary and bonuses as I fear other retailers in this age who have fallen so far from their associate based claims of inherent success.  As they rage through the 2nd depression with their foot on the throat of the American worker at $7.25/hr.
bad,"A typical day of work at The Home Depot consisted of being demeaned at every possible interval. I would consistently sell upwards of $10, 000 per day, and wound up making just over $11 per hour after 3 loyal years of customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and gaining knowledge of a diverse range of products, but that doesn't compensate for being treated like disposable trash. Management is by far the worst part. I suppose working at The Home Depot is better than being unemployed, but after being bullied into quitting as a result of a serious injury, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There is little to no respect for employees, and often management would go out of their way to sabotage your attempts at advancement. Do not apply to the Home Depot unless you want to work too hard for no money with no possibility for advancement."
bad,they dont care about the associate all they care is about customers
bad,"currently working for Diversified on ups grounds as yard man compacting cardboard plastics and maintaining grounds. Looking to accept any offer starting at 14 an hour. willing to send photos of grounds that I keep upon request. 39 years of work experience and can drive a forklift as well as a standard or manual light truck, I'm also bilingual, fluent in both English and Spanish."
bad,"My co-worker were great to work with except 2. Special order service desk, retail sales and cashier was my job description. I volunteered to work in other departments. I worked hard for the minumim wage I received and was willing to work extra time and early morning."
bad,Was with the company 8 years. District team refused to support me when I needed help and when Regional team noticed help was needed it was easy for the district team to point fingers and get rid of me. They were also scared of racial law suits so they kept a manager who was sleeping and harassing associates and kept a Russian who got caught lying several times to keep up with their mix nationalities ratio. Store was great to work for they just leave too much power to district team and HR in Atlanta with their horrible phone investigations.
bad,"They have a system in place to get rid of older workers making higher  wages, so they can hire in young kids for low wages. Each time they cut staff they do not replace them. Even though I was an appliance specialist, I worked in plumbing, kitchen, bath and kitchen design. Most nights I was alone in charge of five departments. It was not fair to the customers. "
bad,"Computer scheduling is done by Atlanta, management signs off on the schedule and takes no accountability when there's a hole in the schedule, yet they approve it, and then act like you can't take breaks and when their understaffed and expect you to do two things at once like help customers, ring customers, cut wood and pack down and up, you can't also take your lunch which is in fact illegal and its not their problems, when you page a manager, the manager hides in managers office and doesn't responds to any calls to them on their first phones. Management tries to pin the blame on you when a customer complains without hearing your side of the story and expects you to sign their pathetic write up without showing proof even if you ask them making you feel set up. A new manager comes in from another store and cleans house of associates they don't like and forms their own click and if your not in it with them, your toast. They make you work in multiple departments with little or not training and if you say no that you don't know how to do something like cutting or fixing something, they act as if its an act of defiance instead of teaching you or ask you to do something that you know you don't know how to do without asking if you know how to do it and then if you get hurt, they deny responsibility that they ever told you to do it. I have never worked in a store with so many ""walks"" and ""meetings"" that when you page a manager, all of them are having lunch with associates in the break room, which which is ""fraternizing"" especially with male managers and female associates in the break"
bad,"a typical day at work.  Review OSHA requirements. what I learn"
bad,What I disliked about The Home Depot employees had to work in 8 degree weather outside to sell Christmas Trees If you became ill/sick to them that was no excuse if you did not have the sick leave hours to accomadate for the days you missed for being sick. Your life has to revolve around The Home Depot
bad,"started working for this company year before they tried to fire me after 6 month and took out my name from appreciation boards i made complaint to human resources corporate they changed the story and lied and managers waited another half year they dropped my review and fired me."
bad,"Do not stress or overwork yourself for this company"
bad,"Home Depot is not a good place to work. Although I do like the work that I do and helping customers the company's motto is ""We put customers first"" but in reality they really don't. Management in Home Depot really doesn't have the best interest of the associates in the grand scheme of things which fosters a really hard environment who work in, be productive in and to get ahead in. Basically they want you to do the job of several people by yourself for very little pay which gets old after awhile and that's why they have a high turnover because people usually wind up leaving"
bad,"Work day consisted of constant harassment towards guests insisting we offer them assistance even if it isn't our department. Whenever guests wish to be left alone, we were deemed not to. There is a buddy program placed in the system like UPS where if you are seniority or friends with one another-the group will gang up and bully individuals. Not even management will comply with discrimination nor diversity issues.  Oh and Benefits? There are none given free. You must pay for ALL out of pocket."
bad,Used to be a good company that VALUED skilled tenured employees that helped build the brand. Now its about eliminating tenured and full-time positions and replacing with part time positions.
bad,"they are strictly a numbers driven company that could care less about an individual that works for them. I worked as a salaried manager and had to work 80 to 100 hours a week to keep up with the work load and they just said it sucks to be you and "" if you don't like it - there's the door"".  they ended up getting sued and an converted us to hourly associates and were forced to pay some overtime compensation, but the lawyers collected most of that money."
bad,home depot is a good co but a lot of the stores have bad mangers and make it very hard for workers. I have seen grown women cry at work because mangers are so bad. i HAVE WORKED AT SOME STORES AND IT WAS GREAT AND OTHER STORES ITS LIKE YOU WALK THRO THE GATES OF HELL.
bad,"Only work here if you like working long hours, low pay, no perks. Its like working at Walmart but for home improvement."
bad,"No advancement, nor can anyone move to full time hours. Departments are always understaffed."
bad,OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID. Management didnt care about coworkers
bad,"typical day at work is be a cashier, repeat your receipt to every single costumer about surveys or what not. Stock shelves. Over all just not a place to work. I worked there for over 3 months and was not impressed with the management, the co workers, or how they ran things."
bad,If the store you are working at does not make the sales quota set out by the corporate office don't expect to have a job long if you are a new hire.
bad,"there are many places you could work that are better than this pit of doom , minimum wage for extremely hazardous labor and bad hours especially if your part time. unpleasant experience."
bad,This was the most viscious and abusive work enviroment I have experienced in 40 years of employment.
bad,"A typical day at work: fix power tools while customers are pouring in many distraction due to understaffing where I'd have to pick up slack and multi-task, make rental contracts for customer, file paper work and customer agreements, "
bad,"Home Depot will look for ways to discard your employment when they are finished with you. If you are full-time, you are on the chopping block!! Home Depot only hires seasonal and part-time people with less than 20 hours a week, mostly about 10 hours a week. Don't ever think you will get full-time employment, it just won't happen."
bad,The home depot is a ylarge corporate company with little to offer to its in store employees. This job is ideal for part time workers.
bad,"Managers are not working together. The employees are not pleased with their pay, the customer service need to go above and beyond, and the managers need to appreciate their employees more."
bad,"Poor management, not productive staffing to meet the required needs of the department.  Little to no assistance from co-workers."
bad,"Poor management, excessive work for one person. Lack of workers, low pay, low hours."
bad,"ICQA,supported the whole building.Any issues I took care them,damages,shortages,overages,RTV, and system issue."
bad,"please ask me, i did not like working here once I found out and confronted why they were dong these mean actions to customers."
bad,Works you to death for very little money. Schedule changes weekly.
bad,"Typical work day is stress on stress, undermining is a blood sport along with bullying from Associates and Management. Most of the coworkers are great, it's the mob mentality when it comes to bullying is hard on a person.Hardest part of the job showing up every day knowing you will be bullied and undermined. Love the work just can not take the harassment and bullying. After 18 years and being bullied for the past 7 or 8 years it looks like it will be hard to get up and go to work every day. I have seen the ASM team look at cashiers that are being  creamed at by customers told to go back to work and help that customer with a smile, even when the cashier is crying the ASM will say you either help or you will be written up.I could write a book on the bad things that I have seen and I would not recommend Home Depot to anyone."
bad,"Do not work here if you want a life, if you want decent pay, or if you expect decent bosses."
bad,"The harder you work here the worse you will be treated. The best advice is don't even bother applying but if you must be sure not to show that you will work hard, if you do they will work you like a horse while everyone else stands around and watches. Their Human Resources department is the reason why people want to Unionize a company."
bad,"I was a HD associate for 15/12 years i worked every department and about every position there was to be except management i have been department head of  4 departments they have but as years went by and magement changes went off like  rocket changing all the time, I hated this cause every manager had there certain click of a crew that they wanted in the store with them so they would make stuff up and make up ways to get rid of people to bring them in. I was let go because i seen a new assistant manager be rude to a customer around christmas time while myself and a new associate were trying to help this customer this asm  started yelling anf said a few rude things to this customer which i though was way un appropriate and i gave the customer the 1800 number to call so since then she  had me do things that take two people to do and would yell at the assocate who would try to help me on top of this i was having medical issues wich the store manager knew about cause i kept him informed after weeks of the abuse from the asm i was gettin worse so my doc had me file for leave of absence once i did that the asm got worse and making me go out side and clean the outside garden from ice and pine needles out side the asm yelled and  and brought me in side the office the next day cause i didnt finish. i told her i would love to see her melt  an whole area of ice and pick up with just me and one associate to help customers at the same time then i was loading a customer with the reach wich is a stand up forklife and then all hell broke loose and some how  after 15 years of laoding people the"
bad,"Turnover rate is incredibly high at this location. If you opt for the front-end, beware of the FES. She petitions to the front-end-ops manager to terminate anyone she has a personal (not work related) issues with; not professional and is often rude and Management is awarded to those who are favored. Executive management often placed blame on lower job levels for their mistakes and lack of communication. Front end coverage was extremely poor and blame was placed on those who had no control over scheduling. Compensation is supposedly ""livable""; however, it is not. ""Standard Operating Procedures"" often changed without notice and without proper communication. Don't be surprised if you are given a performance write-up for their mistakes. In addition, store contains an antiquated money air-tube system. Even if the money returns to the point of entry after you have clocked-out, you WILL be punished."
bad,home depot is an aweful place to work benifits arent that great and management sucks. there inventory sucks they new a new way to do pack down.
bad,no hours management were jerks learned nothing no hard days nothing enjoyable.
bad,You would come clock in and start working right away.during my time there i honestly didnt learn nothing no one really healped me out and there was lack of team work. Management was very lazy and didnt really care about being there. co-workers always have had a negative vibe and there body langue showed they didnt wanna be there. Hardest part was learing to do eveything on my own. i asked two co-workers for help and they never really helped me out and they have gave me attitude.
bad,"Filled with older, burnt out and disgruntled people who do nothing other than complain and treat newcomers terribly. Stay away."
bad,Pay was horrible and labor was extensive. There was always favoritism.
bad,Home depot don't believe in taking care of their employees they are one of the richest companys in the world but start employees with minium wage.
bad,love this job. I was a cashier talking and meeting new people. and gave excellent customer
bad,The district team is horrible. They couldn't manage a gas station.
bad,"I did not working here at all.  This position was temporary because I am a full time graduate student.  Its not the most pleasant work environment, the only thing I enjoyed about this job was to just be productive and help others."
bad,They promoted young people who had no experience to handle people because they were friends of the boss instead of people who had experience and earned the position.
bad,Don't bother working there management would let vet. associates break safety rules & basic work place behavior. Hated every second dealing with my co-workers. Lethargic nature of the people around me was the worst part of it all !
bad,nothing much to tell. crazy place to work and rood customers.
bad,"Not the best, not the worst. Could be better - the environment and the quality of people that work there is not great."
bad,"Its a fast paced day with a lot of unexpected things happening. The associates are very close and work well together, relying on each other to ensure great customer satisfaction. Meeting customer from different cultures is very enjoyable."
bad,this is a wonderful place to work for and the co workers are very nice and love to help others
bad,"great place to work, i was very happy there and i was sorry to see the store close"
bad,"I broke company records, very proud of it.  I made sure I learned the store, so I could assist customers in finding anything they needed, the management could not see the value."
bad,"Once a progressive forward thinking company (part time employees used to receive benefits) that considered customer service top priority, Home Depot seems to have elected to step back and protect its corporate image at the cost of its employees and customers."
bad,"This is a true assessment and not sour grapes.   This is not a pleasant place to work.  It is sad.  Employees walk around on egg shells in fear of being terminated.   This store has a heavy turnover.  This store works on favoritism rather than performance.  If you are not a member of the ruling clique, your days are numbered."
bad,"The company is more concerned about the product instead of the safety of their employees. I had several situations where i had to deal with shoplifters by myself as a 130, 19 year old, female, outside in the garden at night, and couldn't get ahold of anyone. The head cashiers were all self-centered and arrogant as well as most of the managers. This job is not one that I would reccomend to anyone."
bad,"Most days I would walk into a disaster area that took me 3 to 5 hours to clean up.  Management very rarely came back to the receiving department to do the markdowns, most of the time they sat in the managers office texting.  I was probably injured from lifting heavy items off of delivery trucks once a week, I didn't report them because that would just be more leverage fro them to fire me. I was making $2-$4 less than others in this same position.  Noone was held accountable for not doing their job We did not work as a team. Most of the time everyone was trying to stab each other in the back. Home Depot was a great and friendly place to work, up until 4 years ago when HR was removed from the store level, We all turned into numbers instead of human beings. Managers do not know how to do a good job and stand up for good hard working associates."
bad,"Probably the most poorly managed atmosphere imaginable. Pathetic. No communication, information, response, respect. "
bad,"Home Depot is okay to work at, but it depends the store. Team orientated co-workers."
bad,"I will give my honest answer."
bad,"When they first opened not a good place to work.  When employees were hospitalized it did not matter to them if you were sick, or in a car accident.  All that mattered was that you showed up."
bad,"I worked at HD for a while, it was just not something I was interested in doing in the long run."
bad,como buena empleada ya que desde el primer dia de trabajo lo desempeñe con responsabilidad a pesar que la jefa del departamento no me quiso capacitar y sin embargo muchas personas se acercaron al gerente a felicitarlo por la atencion brindada de hecho me dieron un reconocimiento el primer mes de laborar
bad,"A part time one at that, but the hours worked for my schedule at the time."
bad,"I felt trapped there, i enjoyed working with the customers. The management kept changing how the inter acted with the employees."
bad,very strenuous work. work conditions not always favorable. enjoyed co-workers.
bad,working here is for someone that doesnt have much to do at home
bad,"Your schedule varies each week. I was part-time and didn't mind the schedule changes. Since it's retail, you work weekends. No problem."
bad,"Good for a part time job."
bad,"When hired on for a temporary position, they didn't even bother to tell me anything about the duration of the assignment, I just figured that they would give me some kind of heads up. Instead I show up to work one morning and get met right at the door, told to clean my locker out, an envelope with cash in it and that my assignment was over. "
bad,they would garentee you 40+ hours a week and then after the summer with out any worning droped everyone to less then 25 hours a week
bad,Unless your part of the quote unquote supervisory position or higher.  You will always be looked down upon and be treated like you know what.  It's not good enough to show up on time and do a proper job.  I was expected to _____ up to my superiors.  For Nine dollars per hour.  I just can't do it.  Let me do my job and we'll get along just fine.  Thank  you very much.  
bad,dont do it. not my cup of tea. steer clear. lousy. If your strapped for cash try mc dons first.
bad,"When I start there 12 years ago yes it was a nice place to work in now it just like aliens took over the company and they don,t care about anybody or anything no matter how many years you work for them the more years you work for the they want you off their property before you can retire.The employee say they go work not knowing if they have a job or not they are working under a lot of stress that is not fair conditions to work under."
bad,"Start out part time with promises of full time work that never happen.  Scheduled hours and I would show up and they say, ""Oh, the schedule got changed, but they never call to tell you."
bad,The more yrs your with them the harder they try to fire you or make you quit they treat you like garbage 
bad,"I would not work there again, it's not a very good company to worki for."
bad, 
bad,"A typical day at work for me consist of getting to work on time, come into my work place ready to work and having a positive attitude. When I come into work, my mind frame is to the upmost energetic nad people friendly. Im a quick and fast learner and willing to learn new things in all different shapes and sizes. My co-workers would describe me very opened-mined. The harder part of any job, is what you make it. The enjoyable part of any job is where I see and make my customers smile and make their day bloom."
bad,"Get along well with customers meet all their Paint needs, I also work in Hardware and Lawn and Garden, have learned all these jobs since employed here."
bad,"A typical day at the home depot i was working at was horrible. The staff was so unorganized, they wouldn't come to help you with a customer on time when called over the intercom. Everyone thought they were the boss. One of the head cashiers had a nasty attitude and sarcasm. I didnt enjoy working there with no co workers. When i had to shadow with someone, they had attitude and wouldn""t talk, they would walk away without informing me. Luckily im a smart girl and learn quickly. But the staff there is very unprofessional and very unorganized. I had an issue with several people there and when i took it up with the manager on duty they never got back to me about it. One of the managers there would talk inappropriate to the employees there, something that should not be tolerated at all. The hardest part of the day was not knowing whos in charge and having to deal with rude co workers. & also, they have no consideration when it comes down to taking a lunch break. One day i had no money and askd if i can wait 4 my partner to bring me something and i was told i had 30 minutes to wait, or I had to take my break regardless if i had money or not. I truly hope that not every home depot is the same. "
bad,This job should be a stepping stone when you're waiting or looking for something better. Cant wait to leave !
bad,"A typical work day would be for me was work hard & take care of the customers. Typical day for 80 percent of the people who work there complain about their job, sit at the desk area in the department ,  & give you the skink eye when ever you ask them to help you with a customer. what I learned from this store is the management is incompetent & a lot of the employees are CLOWNS. Hardest part of the job was going there knowing I would have to work with rude & lathargic people . The most enjoyable part of the job was when I went in 1 day & realized I didn't need this ""malarkey"" anymore ! "
bad,I've learned to Communicate more with others more and understand the Responsibility of Working 
bad,"A typical day would start with a morning checklist,make sure aisles are clear of any boxes or mercandise. I learn the value of customer service and how to use the tools i sold. My co-workers were a great bunch to work with i learn a lot from the more expirienced workers. "
bad,"At the store in Paducah, it needs new management. It is all about them. Slow to promote anywhere and only if you are best friends with upper management, no matter how well you do your job. There is no respect for employees. Don t even think about leaving your job to serve your country then coming back, because they will give you your job back, at a lower pay and strip you of advancements you made."
bad,"It wasn't a terrible place to work, many friends to see every day. If management was bad, you would have a bad day. Customers treat you like trash, but that's just retail."
bad,co-wrokers are rude to each other and customers.
bad,This place will work you to death. Upper management has no regard for it's employees. I was a salaried associate and had a years worth of hours in half way through the year. Max paid time off you'll ever earn is 2 weeks and you better not ask for it.
bad,Don't try to have a life if you work here. You can get in trouble for requesting days off. I worked here for almost 6 years and wish I could get the 6 years of my life back
bad,Typical day was busy
bad,"Good customer service and values. Helping customers, ringing up customers, answering phones, and providing excellent customer service."
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work for the home depot rapid deployment center in Tolleson!! Management plays favorites and if you aren't a puppet for upper management then you will never get anywhere in the company! They say they like to promote from with in but they have had a area supervisor position open for well over 2 years now! how's that for promoting from with-in!!
bad,"It's nice there, the people were friendly, but I wanted more than just handing a customer goods and sending them on their way."
bad,"No training for employees. No communication , No ladder to climb."
bad,"I worked here for 5 years, good company when I started however quickly went to hell. Management is filled by anyone with a pulse. Low wages, retail level. Expected to serve customers and also restock and heavy work load. not enough staff around, customers not happy, take frustrations out on you. Management is very low level, ""Skippy"" type management. Too young or too old, can't get job anywhere else,"
bad,i got the chance to meet people and build a stronger company with the great new people i had the plessure on meeting
bad,CLOPEN!!!! no weekends. no help from management. crazy stupid hours and no love for employees.
bad,Hours were terrible. They required too much of their employees. The only enjoyable part of the job was getting to drive the heavy machinery.
bad,If you want to work for a company that doesn't walk the talk - work here!
bad,Second shift pulling alot of orders. Compensation bonus was a lie. Management was lack there of. Coworkers and a language barrier. Understanding what direction was very hard because of the barrier. I didnt enjoy the job it was a paycheck
bad,"horrible place to work, back breaking labor, low pay, no breaks, bad management"
bad,This company does the cheer in the morning and expects the team approach to all policies just dont question ANYTHING.
bad,"when i interviewed i was told it was a full time job and only got 30 hours a week at $9.40/hour. now they are cutting everyone back to 20-24. i have to be at work at 4am and have merchandise (enormous amounts often. like the framing of a 1,200 sq ft house or more) and have it loaded on the delivery truck by 6:30am. doesn't sound like a bad job does it? i'm the only puller in our store. i have to pull deliveries, will calls, and BOPIS orders."
bad,I learned how to operate a fork lift and pallet jacks. The hardest part of the job was placing merchandise into the overhead storage areas without damaging anything.
bad,"what I love most about this job is the customers I come in contact with every day. They are awesome. My co-workers are fun,and the management team always go above and beyond to ensure we have a safe and fun enviroment.Not only for our team, but for all the customers as well."
bad,"the managers at the I-55 store in Jackson, MS would make racial slurs at the store meeting. The store manager said that we had to cut down on thieves and he referred to them as Ray Ray and Pookie, which are common nicknames for black people which are very offensive, like only African Americans steal merchandise. The assistant manager has cussed directly at me and other employees. the other manager constantly looks like she is on a narcotic. The poor management is the reason the company is not flourishing, sales for the company were much higher years ago and research has proved it. The managers abuse their employees, do not care about availability and took away our grace period time for people to gain occurrences faster and fire people for no reason, no room to move up, and the pay sucks."
bad,Overtime is frowned upon being a hands on team leader is an offense for which many have been fired.
bad,With a strong work ethic and desire to advance it can be a great company to work for. But often you have to sacrafice your family time to do so.
bad,"If you have any self worth, do not apply here. They take your self respect and leave you like a feeling worthless fool."
bad,"In the last few years Home Depot has been paying steadily decreasing wages. Raises are usually 20 to 40 cents annually for all hourly associates. Opportunity for advancement is there and fairly easy like most retail establishments but wages will be low. Once you have advanced you will have even less job security and can be fired very easily. Despite it's ""upside down pyramid"" propaganda It is really a right side up pyramid with all the usual corporate abuse of the employ at the bottom of the pyramid, which is composed mostly of part time under paid people. They follow the typical trend of all the big boxes which is increasingly crazier hours with no regard for employee's work/life balance."
bad,"very little pay after 5 years, little bennifits no garenteed hours..if you apply for this , you may as well find anouther part time job cause you wont get many hours"
bad,I would rather be working in the medical field instead. The hardest thing about this job is working with the coworkers on my job. The customers are not bad to work with at all.
bad,"To begin with the management stinks, they don't train you, good luck trying to become one of their full time employees and the pay sucks."
bad,"your day is rushed to cover a lunch or break that hasnt been covered on time by management. returns desk is a mess , theres only one cashier working and has to handle multiple customers and large returns with attitudes. some registers dont have enough money to complete a cash return and have to wait for an increase. management is a joke. they all have theyre favorites who they treat different than others. some employees hang out with managers and go to bars and drink. mamangers dating dh's and so on. the most enjoyable part of my job was when i got to clock out and go home."
bad,long days with no lunches 11 to 12 hours.like big high school
bad,"Home Depott in Hilliard, Ohio was a very hostile racial environment, do not apply here."
bad,I worked at home depot for 8 months as a lumber stocker overnight I was never trained on the lift truck or fork lift so I walked around lost for 8 months I asked if I could get my training in but they never trained me
bad,"Employees are just a number at Home Depot. No job security, no full time employment, low pay, no recognition, high level of stress, know many instances of employees being ""railroaded"" out the door with no support from head office."
bad,"With the exception of a couple GREAT managers, they were always nowhere to be found! Now, I'm super independent, BUT there are things you need them for like manger approvals, cash/change, price changes and totally IRATE customers!"
bad,"Home Depot makes it seem like they are the best company in the market and no other company is better than them. This is false, all they care is about the numbers regardless of who's life they damage or ruin. When I started with the company it was one of the good companies to work for, a company that cared about its employees and look out for their best interest. Now, managers only cares about their bonuses and disregards the most important part of the business the consumer. When they he company promises employees a good raise if they work hard at the end of the year and then they disrespect the employee with 15 cent raise. Managers say that the raise is low because of the economy but then they go to Las Vegas for the company's high pay-out because of the successful year they had as a business. Then the insurance package is the most expensive package ever offered to an individual with family with high paying co-payments and these are just some of the issues going on in the company."
bad,Great company but lack the right management to take it beyond all other building material companies
bad,management young and had discriminatory problems for many years and the company does nothing to back employees
bad,"I learned how to work with people,receive frieght, and working with the plants. The hardest part was not being able to fix a customers problem"
bad,the company is a great place to work at its just that many managers over their dont provide good leadership.
bad,"Work there almost three years. Every day was stressfull. i did learn Great Customer service, home improvment, Forklift Truck, Reach truck, and Order picker. Management is horrible, to concerned on what you couldn't get down, then how hard you worked on what you did work on. More worried about customer concerns then employees. Some many co-workers, some are friends, some you can't stand, some you pay no attention to. Hardest part was to complete your full day of duty's, while dealling with customers. Managements will write you up if tasks are not complete reguardless if customer stop you left and right. Yet home depot is all about ""customer First"" and if a customer is displeased another write up. either way you can't win, that why management is horrible. and the most enjoyable part of the job was punching out."
bad,"first time i bumped a plastic poll guard two supervisors stated that i did no damage that whatever damage was ther before i hit it due to the dust on it ,2nd i was written up for being coached off the clock on driving a pallet jack, 3rd time i bumped a poll no one had seen it ,however being responsible i told my supervisor, again ther was no damage to the guard, after telling my supervisor another supervisor stated that"" dont worry about it ther is no damage they wont fire you"" after which they fired me"
bad,"ulture supposedly built om=n customer sevice, unless you roam out if your job description, then, individual DS's and ASM's dont care about Home Deopt values/ they ONLY WANT YOU WORKING FOR THEM IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS SO THEY CAn maximize their own carers."
bad,Worked for company for over nine years. Started out with a great management team. Had to leave when friends of management were being promoted over skilled workers.
bad,Management was poor. ALOT of work for Little pay. The bonuses were good
bad,"If you are female or older and looking for opportunity, don't go to home depot. Almost all promotions go to young white males. You see VERY few women in management. They talk inclusiveness but it ends at talk. As for other forms of recognition, selective perception is the rule. Once management decides how they are going to think about you, they only look at behavior that reinforces the opinion they already have. As for scheduling, ""flexible schedule"" in their definition means you will be scheduled to work until 11 pm one night, then be scheduled back in to open the next morning at 6am. As for ethics and following SOP, the joke is those things are only important when it convenient to do so. I could go on, but I will just close by saying apply here only as a last resort."
bad,Wanted you to learn all about everything- with pay the same as when you started-$7.50/hour. Asked manager about raise after 3 months- he said no raise for from 6 to 12 months. Very big employee turnover.
bad,The last several years since the original founders left to pursue other interests have resulted in a downward spiral in all phases of HD operations. The original store in Pontiac had over 300 orange apron associates when the store first opened to back up their claim of customer service first. The current staff is under 50 and consists of mostly inexperienced part time employees. There is no future for advancement and no commitment to customer service at any level.
bad,"Maybe the values back in the USA work, but in Puerto Rico, they don't, management is poor. The employee does not get a fair valuation. It is incredible that a multi-millionaire company set their raises rate based on its economy and not on the employees effort through out the whole year!! what's the good of giving that extra mile if it is not going to be taken in consideration? Values? what values if the management goes out with their employees?? The Home Depot Management in Mayaguez sees their employees just as numbers, work mules, not as people. Not to mention that the only thing a person needs to become a full employee or supervisor in this store is to be liked by the district human resources manager, incredible but true, that's why there are so many incompetent employees in this store."
bad,"i only worked with home depot for a month, but when i would start the day things would be fine until the managers came and criticize everything you did even witnessed a customer tell my manager how good i did and he did not even care. i learned a lot about household products, and garden products, because i had no training. so i was forced to go on the floor and read and learn things as i went on."
bad,"Conferred with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products or services, take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or obtain details of complaints."
bad,"First remember that this is only one store and for Lawn & Garden. While the corporate training focuses on customer service, safety and how important associates are, the reality in the store was far from that. I was treated better by management at my first job at Burger King. I have never seen worse morale in a job."
bad,"I didnt enjoy my almost four years at home deopt. My typical work day would be cashiering. I was a po desk cashier. I would also stock shelves, answer phones, and clean. I learned alot of good customer service skills from this job. Management was horrible and very unorganized this was the worst part of this company. The hard part of the job was working a long period of time with no lunch. the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers."
bad,"On a typical day we were all treated with disrespect, our schedule was changed without notice and employees were always disgruntled."
bad,"Typical day: repetitive, not being allowed to make immediate changes."
bad,when home depot was run under the original founders it was a great place to work then they stepped out and it went down the tubes from there withe the new ceo the company only cared about the bottom line when the board of directors bought out the contract of that ceo and brought in the new ceo it looked like it was going to turn around and for a while it did then the economy took a turn for the worse and then some where the company started to get rid of all the long term employees that stuck it out through thick and thin the employees don't have any place or any one to turn to the company puts on a good face and says the right things in public but behind the scenes it is another story if the employees ever got together and joined a union at this point the employees would be better off but the managment has the employees running scared with verble threats of loosing your job or they get you when it comes to your pay raise the company use to give out good raises now they think a two percent is ok managment says it has an open door policy if you try to use it they pay nack is so that they force people to quit or do something to the point that the person will do something to be fired they also have a hot line that you can call they say its a secret and that no one will find out thats wrong they tape the aware line then play it back to the person or persons that the complaint was made about i used to say to people that home depot was a great place to work that the problem was at the store level only i now feel totally diffrent in that upper managment just doesn't care as long as
bad,"The home depot is a big business house, however the employees are never get satisfied with management. Poor management, favoritism, discrimination, keep long term temp positions are the features of Home Depot. This is a worst place to work."
bad,"Love to work for Home Depot, because you are treated as a family, it is a fun workplace, training program is excellent. Overall it is an awesome place to work."
bad,"Management is sucky, was sort of like a joke. Nothing I already knew, co- workers were not much help, staying late straighten aisles, off days."
bad,"terrible work enviroment, management uses intimidation to oversee associates"
bad,"Work hard, everyday. You need to be a specific type of person to work here."
bad,A typical day at work is me running around trying to do my job and everyone else job. And I never have anyone to help me so when something doesn't get done I get yelled at. What I have learned about this job is I need to get out of here. My co-workers suck they are lazy. Management is a joke because they are involved in certain groups of employees and they always get better treatment than any of the others. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I go home so I don't have to see that place or anybody else for that matter.
bad,Point blank worst job ever I have ever worked at in my entire life....no comment no more to say.Apply at your own risk.
bad,"It use to be a good place to work,things change alot over the years, low pay .the associates are very nice ."
bad,"Incompetent staff, managers and they work you to the bone for basically no pay, no benefits. View you as a profit margin not as an employee"
bad,When I first started working here it was pretty good. Shortly after I noticed how they schedule you to work 40 hours one week then the next week you work 10 hours. They don't work with.your avaliability the don't have enough lot associates to load orders for people so you end up doing it yourself. The human resource lady is worthless and sucks up to all the managers and thinks shes to good to talk to anyone. This was probably the worst job I've ever had. Something needs to be done at this location. I don't even know how they stsyvin business cause management is always giving customers free products.
bad,A lot of cashiers didn't like to work. Only two or three worked while the Front End Managers just hung out all day at the Self Check out machines.
bad,"Home Depot is a great place to work. Very professional, excellent benefits, great work environment. Allows for advancement."
bad,managers were not very bright or people persons. would never go back to working there
bad,The company is very unorganized and the managers show bias to employees.
bad,i loved working there i gave them 2 years they work me to the bones and they let me go ... and my manager used to yell at me in front of customers
bad,"Grown people participating in high school cliques and gossip. The problem starts with the unqualified/uneducated management. Promotion is based on being a tattletale, not job performance."
bad,this is a job any high school student would do to try and supplement their income
bad,Home depot was the worst job i ever had ther managment was rude and didnt care and the other employees didnt know anything or didnt do there job properly
bad,"They Offered was $12.00Hr I received a more generous offer. I politely declined the offer. 2012 I reapplied 9.50Hr same position more experience and they want you to be flexible.Or on call. You need two jobs to live in miami,fl There is no such thing as flexible if you plan on making real money. Let's face it no one gives overtime anymore. So if they don't pay you have to find other means of bringing in the ca$h Flow.on other jobs exetera on call meaning you pay me full time and I sit and wait if you call during the remaining time agreed upon That's on call. Not taking advantage of."
bad,if you enjoy hard labor for $10hr then this is the job for you. i worked for this company for a long time its no joke on labor you definatley put in a hard days work. most of the time their is no problem getting a full 36-40+ hrs a week. for a group of guys working together their is a lot of drama and unprofessional behavior. i was not impressed by the management due to ethics and railroading employees. the turnover rate while i was there averaged 200% . zero job security. the BCBS of texas healthcare was good but the dental and vision coverage was no name companies that had very little or no coverage by local doctors.
bad,"Great for kids, but not a career builder. Tons of managers that are never to be found that do not back up their associates. Training is in word extolled, but in practice never done. Always under staffed."
bad,"They encourage you to rat people out so people that are not your friend falsely report something and then upper management believes them before they even investigate the situation  "
bad,"In my region the Manager was Jamaican, thus on our main store the HR Manager was Jamaican and all good paying positions were occupied by Jamaicans. Even though I was among the top in sales, attachments and warranties I was paid less than a newcomer that was, you guessed it, Jamaican."
bad,If you’re a female prepare to be sexually harassed daily. Management does absolutely nothing. The pay sucks & you’ll be required to train in multiple departments just so they can make you do other people’s jobs too.
bad,"Falta que el equipo de RH de OAT realmente realicen su funcion y tengan mas sensibilidad del campo. Falta que visiten las tiendas y que escuchen a sus equipos de campo, no tienen sensibilidad de lo que suceda en  las tiendas"
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Company practiced favoritism, favoring newer people who had started, giving them promotions, and completely overlooked people with seniority. Horrible management, customer service, many customers at the time I left the company had horrible things to say about the company."
bad,Large corporations don’t care about you and Home Depot is the worst. Management tells everyone that they are the next one to be promoted. So many lies it’s unreal.
bad,"This job doesn’t pay good at all, the more you work the less pay you get.iv bin working here for almost a year and from my experience its not worth it"
bad,Plenty of work hours in the summer but no hours in the winter that is the reason I left home depot. Management is not very supportive or helpful at training employees. I learned the business on my own.
bad,"This review is for the warehouse in topeka, not the store. The management has no actual care for the physical well being of its employees/workers. Though they couldnt 'fire' anyone for a workplace injury, no matter how accidental, they would find loopholes to provide write ups. You're expected to do ALL functions as an associate but only get paid as much as new people who start."
bad,"It was ok for the first two years working as a night stocking, but I switched to delivery coordinator and what a mistake, between the bopis, the actual deliveries of deck orders, management, and the afternoon delivery employees not doing there job. So I would get to work at 4 am and have to pull all the deliveries for the day in 2hrs. ( HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!)"
bad,They don't pay for you speaking spanish even when they say you will. Poor work hours. Management have favorites employees.Nothing with cultures.New hirings
bad,non productive stressful working environment with a lot of unresolved conflicts between management and fellow associates with no chance of advancement!!!!
bad,The pay is horrible and management is worse.  The shifts are long and take a toll on your body.  You have no control over your schedule if you are full time.  You have no control over your position if management wants to move you to another department. It is not easy to get requested days off.
bad,"The security is based on customer service and security related functions are given a back seat. Initial training is good, but after that no further security training is given."
bad,"If you are not in a clique with your manager, they will make your work life horrible no matter what, even if you get exceptional responses from others."
bad,"Home Depot pays minimum wage but expects perfect performance. I worked as a vault associate and if the company had been honest with me about what the job entails I never would have accepted the position. In that position the associate is responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in cash, but the job pays close to minimum wage. Additionally, you have to be clocked in by 5:00 and being even a few minutes late will result in immediate threats to terminate your employment. The store I worked had a toxic work environment and constant turnover. I would strongly caution anyone against accepting any position with HD."
bad,The management does not care about you. The pay is absolutely terrible for the work that you have to do. They put to much work on each employee. You have to work every weekend and all holidays.
bad,Was hired seasonal but was told would become fulltime soon as season was over went from 40 hrs. a week to 1 day a week and you get paid biweekly go figure. Not even a great starter job DON'T DO IT!!!!
bad,The Home Depot is one of the lowest paying jobs in the current market.   Use your brain and do a small amount of research before wanting to work here.
bad,"Merchandiser was extremely boring,hard and heavy work."
bad,"Very poor pay. Very punitive management style. No vacation days until after one year, then only one week. They keep you on part time status by working you 40 hours per week with one short day every six weeks so they don't legally have to make you full time. The entire management style from the 1940's."
bad,i have nothing good to say about the home depot it was bad.low pay hours horrible bad management at the time and he was fired one will help  up the ladder you have to be a monster and rellay kiss alot of ... to get anywhere
bad,"In short, Home Depot has adopted the Wal Mart mindset of expunging employees that make too much and are experienced in favor of cheap labor. "
bad,"You are just a statistic at Home Depot, anyone can be replaced on the spot at any time. Pay attention to their meaningless policies if you don't some day you will become a meaningless employee."
bad,"Management uses fear as motivation and incompetence is explained away as nobody is perfect. If you do whatever management ask, then you do not have to do anything else( like your actual duties). Hard work may be recognized if you are on the good side of management."
bad,I have experience running larger machines like front end loaders and excavators but I never had the chance to run forklifts. I knew gaining that experience would make me more versatile as an employee.
bad,They don't care about you. The higher ups don't care how hard you work and give all recognition to the people who have been around longer. It's a horrible working inviroment. The mangers are all about telling you what you are doing wrong and never show how to fix the problem. It's a complete negative inviroment to work in.
bad,Very little training & are thrown to the wolves. As a design consultant you are at the mercy of the project manager to put your job into production before you get paid & it’s only .75% up front & .25% when the job is complete. As a single mother of three I went over a month without pay on several occasions and still had to run all of the appointments that were set & some weren’t confirmed. Many times the clients wanted to paint their cabinets rather then spend 15% of the total cost of their home to reface their kitchen.
bad,Worked at store 3311. Store falling apart. Store manager does not care about employees. Understaffed and over stressed. Stay away from this company. Better places to work at.
bad,You’re expected to be an expert in whatever department you’re scheduled in as well as all other departments around yours. Training is sub-par at best. Promotions are not given fairly. They would rather give an open position to someone from another state than from within- regardless of job performance
bad,"Typical day: Understaffed across the store.  Management nod their heads and smile a lot, that's about it. "
bad,Home Depot is an embarrassment to work for a company that doesn’t care about their employees  they treat them with no respect whatsoever  I work for the Hendersonville Home Depot for nine months with little or no pay for the kind of work that I did
bad,Managers are ignorant and only worry about their selfs and don't care to help out any employees make you work outside in the heat and don't bring you water or give you a break
bad,"I learned very quickly it is a favoritism based company. Your performance, Your work ethic, None of that matters if your not well liked by your peers. I literally got called into the office and told that I need to suck up more so that I fit in better. Horrible. This was just my store, I'm sure its different based on the store and staff you get."
bad,"During my time there, it was nothing but favoritism and lying. Most times when you wanted to express that you wanted to move up, good luck unless you are buddy-buddy with the managers. "
bad,"This company has been paying people less and less while cost of living keeps rising. The business model is not sustainable. They can not retain quality employees due to lack of competitive pay, high stress hours and a general lack of consideration for employees lives outside of work."
bad,This is a man's job hard labor low pay long hrs and no benefits very hard working job. Plenty of lies told bout crossing over after 3mths but instead they fire you and you never cross over they certain picks which is unfair worst job ever and that I ever had.
bad,Got wrote up because a customer wanted a refund for the products i scanned for her. Management sucks unless youre a girl. The pay isn’t worth the stress you get
bad,When I began there the store manager who had interviewed and hired there I loved it. Had no better place I was ever employed. When store manager changed the store went downhill. I have been gone from there for over a year and I am told that the downward spiral has continued.
bad,"The freight lead was geared to work with men, He feels women are useless and only good for unpacking freight. Doesn't give women the chance to advance or utilize them with the experience I had. Would not recommend Home Depot to any one."
bad,"It is not what you know. But who you know, and kiss ***. Supervisor will scream at you every time. There is no communication between the entire stuff. They will set you up for failure, when ever they want."
bad,"Started extremely strong, working 40+ hrs but at the end of my job I was going through a lot and I needed the time off they will give me a hard time about it not only that but then it was very high school,gossipy & cliques. I was underpaid and overworked I worked in the plumbing department and nobody but me worked then they would have me also work at the paint desk which I was initially trained for and worked for six to seven months of before transferring over to plumbing and nobody would ever show up for their job but nobody was ever fired for not doing their job I was going through something and then they fired me because I wasn't able to make it to work for one day"
bad,Home Depot did not train me properly for the job i was working for. I was not able to succefully help customers and I felt stressed 24/7. They also discriminate people because of religion. When I first applied i let them know that i needed Sundays off. A few weeks after I started working my manager told me I had to work Sundays! Co workers were  unprofessional. Home depot is not a postive environment to work in!
bad,Manager sat in office all day long laughing and talking with other managers. Manager very unprofessional. Assistant Manager was rude. Some friendly co-workers but not many.
bad,"The level it takes for you to be a supervisor or a manager is a 3rd grade certificate. Very low level of education with no proper management skills, and leadership is so poor no one has an opportunity for advancement,  only if you brown nose well and fit in a sort of click. Petty people and management sucks.You'd be lucky to be put into a dept you like."
bad,Working at Home Depot in getting beat down day after day till you can't take it anymore. Never enough employees scheduled to get all the nessesary work done. No accountability for the many slackers working there. Just a horrible work enviroment. Nobody is happy and the pay sucks. Huge employee turnover.
bad,Their productivity scale is to high for anyone to make performance. I drive 32 miles one way an hour out and work 10 hours a night from 5 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. I need to find a job closer to home and during morning hours so I can be home for my kids.
bad,I work at the one in Rockwall! The freight team is not a good place to work. They require you to do 40 packages per hour! Not everyone can do that many and work that fast! I have a shift supervisor that’s always giving me a hard time. This work is back breaking and you can’t lift heavy stuff and work super quick. It’s dangerous and you should be able to take your time. They don’t want to hire anymore full timers even though we are very short handed. They also don’t pay very well for all that is required.
bad,"Upper management shows favoritism and don't hold them accountable for their work.  Conflicting instructions from upper management and major safety problems.  "
bad,Did not enjoy working here. This place dragged. It was unsafe and a long day everyday. Do not work here if you can help it. You will regret it. The management is a mess
bad,Florida ave in tampa is the worst job site and they never have cashiers only self checkout cashiers are rude mangers are clueless this company makes alot of money and treat the employees bad go to lowes less stress
bad,"They make it seem like it’s this great place to work because of the flexible hours and outside work life, but the job itself is stressful and takes a huge toll on your mental wellbeing."
bad,Been with Home Depot for awhile now and was finally given full time just recently after it being given to other very undeserving individuals who are known to sleep with the managers and supervisors. Work us like crazy for little pay and small 25-39 cent raises once a year. Store is very understaffed and most of the time you’re covering at least one other department as well as your own
bad,"If you are lucky and get in a great store you better thank your lucky stars! Worked in different stores as ASM and they all are about the same. Way too many hours a week and Store Managers who have no business being in the position. Most get there because of who they know in the District level. Stores are under staffed which makes us work even more hours. Too many ""walks"", ""ad sets"" and ""meetings"" in this company. Every store I worked in the ASM's worked way more hours then the Store Manager ever did. Most associates make more per hour then the ASM's and no, the perks are not good. Nobody can do this long term, it just isn't possible to abuse your body that long. This is why they lose all of the good managers. I stayed longer than I should have hoping it would change but it isn't going to because they don't care."
bad,"Worst place to work at! They ""train"" you for two weeks and then throw you out there. By ""train"" you, I mean sit you down on a computer for 8 hours for two weeks and expect you to know everything. The managers don't even know what's going on. They just listen to  their employees talk and get involved in drama. It's honestly ridiculous. Most of the time you are just wondering around wondering what to do."
bad,"A typical day includes listening to 20 year veterans complain about change and new hires quit because of low pay. HR does not help anyone - they make you call a call center for help and most people cannot help you.  The store managers talk bad about the employees.  And getting a day off is like pulling teeth.  Working in dangerous conditions is common and they do not have security in the store to protect the employees from irate customers.  Overall, unless you joined 20 years ago and got free stock, this is not a place to make a career.  And the recruiters do not call you for any position unless you know someone, even if you have more education than the person hiring you.  And the aprons look ridiculous.  Seriously, how sexist that they still have a Do it ""herself"" workshop.  So they pretend they have diversity - there is one leader who is the only story they have - a AA cashier who started 34 years ago and now is a millionaire.  One person, everyone else is a work horse with no pay.  Stay away please.  The founders are billionaires laughing all the way to the bank.  The employees are expandable."
bad,"To many ""bosses"" around.  One person will tell you one thing, another will tell you something different.  I'm still not sure who is who.  No one who's ""in charge"" ever carries a first phone so good luck...……….never mind.  It's so disorganized and chaotic that it would take to long to explain.  Oh I will say this.  The threw away my badges.  At my old store I earned 3 platinum badges and 3 gold, 4 silver and 4 bronze.  That means LOTS of badges in between as well.   The really were a point of pride for me.  The just threw them away.  They claim it was because they put up signs saying they were going to throw away everything in our lockers because we were getting new ones.  That is NOT what the sign said.  But that's the way this store it.  They have the worst communication skills.  The customers are awesome actually, it's not the customers.  It's the people I have to work with that makes the entire atmosphere depressing."
bad,You dont move on unless you know someone or are related with management.. It was afoul...customers yell at you and management gives them discount s. They dont have your back.if someone in management dont like you your out...saw that a lot....
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for the home depot, the management is worried about advancing their own careers to the point that they stop caring about the people they are supposed to be supervising, remember, at the home depot you are just a number, and if they don't like your performance they have no problem hiring another number to replace you."
bad,Store managers often tell associates to abide by policies but do not stand behind the policy when called for customer complaints. Company has unnecessary policies such as open availability for all shifts on Sunday despite adequate coverage for your area because they want to force you to work in other areas where the associates make more money. There is no compensation for working in the additional department.
bad,Its un organized always the last five years d.s managers all manage differently instead of following a set process people they hire don't know anything no pro people anymore to teach people they hire don't even try to help customers alot are lazy I shocked there still in business they need more on hand management always out of stock inventory always is wrong
bad,"As a former employee... 7 years as a MET associate and I finally had to just give 2 weeks and go. Store employees NOT MET friendly and always hearing out of associates  mouths “F’n MET!!” . MET sup, lazy, always smoking. And let’s not talk about wages. 7 years making $12.22..... while new people coming in , who know NOTHING... making more...?!?!.  Sad and disheartening to say the least!!"
bad,Things I've seen is something I never seen in any other retail business ever they treat and talk about the employees bad behind their backs and you can't get anyone to help especially the men or managers
bad,"Don't expect to have any life as they schedule you long shifts and give you a hard time if you request off. In the winter and off seasons dont expect to have more than 8 hours a week! Managers basically bully you around. Unless you're a man don't expect to be treated fair. The men just hang and talk and demand you to do everything. Was constantly yelled at and told I did everything wrong even when I know I did it right. Also be prepared because the guys who drive the forklift seem to think they're management and that they can boss you around. They also make you lift everything and do it all by yourself because they wont leave their previous forklifts. As a 150 lbs woman, I couldn't possibly lift a lot of things by myself, and if you asked them for help, not only did you get an attitude but you heard about it for weeks! The guys hang around on their forklifts and do nothing. You really can't find them anywhere when you need them! They also make rude comments and make you feel horrible about yourself. I cried everyday I worked there. If you ask anyone for help they give you an attitude and act as if you just asked for their leg. But dont worry when they want you for something or to cover a shift they're so nice! They also live to gossip and talk about you behind your back.  I have never worked for a company where people treat you so poorly.  Theres a few good people who treat you right. But they are few and far between. Customer service and the cashiers are complete air heads as all they do is gossip and talk. If you ask for help or for them to ring a customer up or you know..."
bad,"Horrible pay for the amount of work you do.Always customers needing help and understaffed....They don't want to spend anything on staffing the place,to take some of the pressure off of their employees"
bad,Very high turn over rate and management down to employees have been disciplined do to harassing women employees. Also the management sucks they dont listen or care about your needs and are just there like they just hate there job.
bad,"Management doesn't care about employee problems, pay not living wage, blames everything on corporate policy.  DH's need more personnel training instead of kissing butt."
bad,"This company likes to preach they have a culture of values, but managers will tell you they understaff the store on purpose because they would rather stress the associates than pay more people to work there. Management told me specifically the customers are still going to purchase whether they wait for help or not."
bad,At my store there are only 2 women managers. Men are priority and if u work night shift treated like 2 hand help. My direct manager was cool but store manager couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag
bad,"Working as a cashier is horrible, you have to get customers to apply for Home Depot credit cards and if you didn’t get enough cards, they would discipline you. Management is horrible, the hours you work is crazy and the pay is low for what you have to deal with on a daily basis. Some customers are great and some are rude. They need better management"
bad,"ItIt was a OK place to work at for A while but there was no room for advancement, and the pay was not good. And in other words to summarize all of the words I’m done"
bad,I would not recommend any one working there. very unfair place to work unless you are African american. If this is the case then you only have to work as hard as you want because management wont say a word to you but will ride on your back if you are anyone else.
bad,Management is horrible. I don’t know if it’s just this store but it needs a lot of work . Don’t depend on teamwork . It’s like high school all over again .
bad,The Home Depot should have more flexible hours and make way/encourage people who would like to move up the ladder. The management does not get along or agree with each other half of the time. It is a very discouraging and draining place to work.
bad,Getting reprimanded for doing your job managers not on the same page you normally have 3 managers on duty at the same time and managers that refused to talk to customers when they were upset
bad,"The customers that I have dealt with are very argumentative and self entitled, the millennials that work there get away with anything."
bad,I definitely would say the corporate office is not a great place to work! The management for the customer service department was terrible and underhanded.
bad,Working For This Company Is Stressful... You Get Treated Unfairly ...The Managers Have no respect for their employees.. U work like a slave there ...they don't appreciate nothing or give u anything for the hard work u do..but force u to get home depot credit cards..and they let u get bullied by other co workers and don't do anything about it....Don't apply for this job if u do good luck.
bad,The Home Depot has horrible management they also play favoritism and they will exclude you from certain shifts. They tell you to help as many customers as you can do you do so and if the customer takes you out of your department and if there’s other associates but everyone is busy management still won’t let you help to your full extent and they will tell you to pass the customer off to someone else. In orientation they tell you not to do that unless you have no knowledge of what the customer is asking for then you may ask other associate for help but to stay with the customer and associate the whole time until the customer leaves. Another Home Depot store may have better management but store 0408 in Casa Grande Az is not a good work environment nor a place to move up at. Over all the Home Depot is not a place I recommend to work.
bad,Would let you assume jobs of running front end never giving any extra pay any type of recognition or acknowledgement the absolute worst company I ever worked for would never go back again manager extremely unfair and has preferences on who they want to give advances to
bad,"Working here was easy, but I had wanted to advance for months to a paint associate or a garden associate; both positions they needed to fill; and they never did. Theres management was rude, and the was way too much drama working there."
bad,"My review was being brought aboard under false pretenses. Many colleagues enjoy putting their work on you, or asking for help, but never to return the favor."
bad,Working at the Home Depot in CA is a last resort. The management group and corporate only see numbers. The wages and hours are so poor a second and third job are going to be required to keep affording the bills.
bad,"When I started in 2003, The Home Depot was a very good place to work. Clear objectives, clear instructions, positive reinforcement."
bad,"I will never work for these racists again. From the customers to the upper management they will grind you into the ground with racist comments or actions. Whenever you bring up anything about it they will pretend like nothing has happened and sweep it under the rug. The monthly quizzes that they have you take will say how much this company cares about its employees when it doesn't. There are no discounts, breaks are unorganized, and there is very little respect in that place. The company will also try its best from paying you for what they want you to do. This company is horrible."
bad,24 and three-quarter years is what I poured into this company blood sweat and tears PS I got paid yes I got vacation yes they got one heck of an employee and what I got at the end was there’s the door very disappointed three people  just like myself with  tenure  was shown the door on the same day so that they wouldn’t have to pay insurance so they wouldn’t have to have a full-time associate and they could hire part-time little people suffer it hurts.
bad,Very grim compensation for a job that required a lot of hard work.  Never allowed to sit unless you had a note from a doctor and even then they were dubious.  The insurance was insufficient for any type of real illness and the raise I got on my already appalling salary was .10 after a year's time.
bad,outside sales HDI was nothing like the store. It's a disjointed division of the company. It's a poorly  managed arm of the company. I was never given all of the money owed to me and i actually went into the red with this job.
bad,"been working for HD for about 10 yrs and no room for advancement there employees get mistreated and feel like stress just for working there everyday, management are the worst with in any other company that i work for. take my advice if your looking for advancement dont work for this company take another job that will value there employees and are looking to promote employees for there hard work. not by favorites"
bad,"Very unprofessional and emotional management, highly under trained, not enough help in the stores,, the pay is absolutely positively horrible you literally have to be a high school student to work any position in these stores because being a grown up you can't afford working there as a single job, I mean seriously the money is horrible, you get paid more working at Chick-fil-A"
bad,"The SSA position is not boring.  Time will fly.  I enjoyed multi tasking, problem solving, variety of tasks and responsibilities.  I enjoy working with a variety of people. I did NOT enjoy:  the slow computer system,  system locking up or shutting down when I was in the midst of helping customers,  associates not picking and locating customer's orders correctly, the shortage of associates to provide coverage and customer service, the LOW PAY for this intense position.  The Pay does not match the position. One will wonder why he/she are doing this when there are many other job options that are less stressful that pay the same or more."
bad,"At the location where I worked, they showed a lot of favoritism and those who they didn't like they either let you know in how they treated you or just completely ignored you. Professional employees are looked at as brown-nosers. There is also a lot of closet racism."
bad,"My manager was VERY rude! Didn't care about ANYTHING but, the job. Which, I guess is good on some levels. Doesn't look at your work till you are done, then says WRONG, do it over!"
bad,to tell it thru the eyes of an employee. it was stressful to the point of having a mental brake. trying to keep to unrealistic goals and time constants.
bad,"No a good place to work,  hours and payment too low, bad environment. Too much work for poor payments. Just don’t go. I hated when I was there. Call me if you want a professional opportunity, seven eight six five four nine 9060."
bad,If your a manager you good otherwise youll be written up and fired after 6 months or year. If your area does not meet quota they write you up like its your fault sales are low then they ultimateley fire you.
bad,"Management is poorly trained and plays favorites.  I came into the job withe the required skill set.  The service desk supervisor favored her friends, and didn't care about the rest of us."
bad,Management send you on the floor with little to no knowledge of the store or the products your trying to sell. No one really helps one another it seems like everyone is in it for themselves.
bad,"do not go if you intend on making it a career, you will be stuck, you dont get promoted, and they have badges that allows you to get discounts on their online websites. if customers gives enough raving review you get one. if you get enough credit cards open you get, and they almost never gives you yours only their friends. some of the supervisors, ASM , and head cashier wont promote you unless you sleep with them."
bad,"The philosophy being of associate driven minimizes the ability for people to lead; especially if it is different from what has been previously done. Senior leadership is not involved to know when the locations have ""cleaned up for company"" or if what they are seeing is the ""normal"" wasy of business."
bad,"This was a great place to work in the beginning. New management came along, and that's where everything went downhill for me. The morale in the workplace for a lot of us was never the same."
bad,"management was not fare to anyone they picked and choose who stayed and who they fired. they also picked who they advanced in each department. the people were good, the pay was okay but you never knew when you were going to be walked."
bad,"Well in all honesty most of the people are cool, The hourly ones at least. Management is a joke though. They treat their people like replaceable bags of meat, Zero chance of moving up unless you continuously kiss butt no matter how much experience you have. I ran a store for 5 years outside of home depot and was passed over 4 times for any promotion. Twice because of a disability that in no way hindered my ability to work. Even being turned down in favor of a 17 year old kid that hadn't even finished high school despite 2 years working professionally in the field. The benefits are laughable. They provide insurance for your pet but want 600 a month out of your check for your insurance that doesn't cover squat. You have to deal with running 3 to 4 departments at a time because they never schedule enough people even on really busy days. If you complain about anything you face immediate retaliation from department heads and management. Theres plenty of harassment to go around for women working there. You get talked to like you're 3 by male contractors no matter how long you've been working there, worst 3 years I've ever wasted in my life. If you want to work at a hardware store that badly get on at Lowe's at least the management treats you like a person there. Don't work here unless you 110 percent need to or your brain will explode."
bad,"While at Home Depot. I was in high school, they always scheduled me during school. The management was poor and when there was a problem the store manager never helped."
bad,"Very Bad Training, Just watched a few video's and put out in my position as head cashier, after one day of shadowing a FT cashier for 1 day. My supervisor who was supposed to be training me on being a ""Head Cashier"" was interviewing part time cashiers the first 2 weeks of my working there. They said that If I had any questions or problems I was to call the Manager on Duty if my supervisor was not available. The MOD's were always busy with other things or in meetings to really be any help to me."
bad,"Management started firing associates that made more than 10.00 per hr, they constantly harassing employees writing them up for sneezing wrong, not paying overtime and cutting  people's hours, spreading rumors."
bad,"worst company ever, management at the eagle store 1809 was the worst. did not take care of there employees. it is all about the numbers and not individuals. would not recommend at least at that store."
bad,"Well I worked here almost 6 yrs , they made a lot of corporate changes and makes its even harder to truly earn a buck. No mayyer if they consider you an asset or not , I’ve seen many sthings house as myself and better , get treated like it didn’t even matter.  This company has taught me one lesson more than I even realized. I’m well aware of my worth and look forward to all those who have tried to hire me out of that place. I turned down asome great opportunities because of my faith in the orange apron . Trust me, after the 3 rd year I really started to second guess our company’s overal “Morale “ . Don’t take my advice for it , take your own experience , apply today and you’ll see very soon."
bad,Over my 9 years with the company i have done a lot of job titles at the Colorado stores and when i started it was a great place to work in the first few years. I would say since the change in the CEO the company has seemed to be worse and the demands on the employees is more with no added benefits it seems to take more away instead
bad,Home Depot does not offer many advances but promises many.  Dead in job. Left to seek other opportunities. Department Manager took in appropriate pictures of crew and blasted throughout he store.  Was called Names like Fat  etc... very abusive environment.  I'm an excellent employee who did not need to take it.
bad,The management was horrendous. They would yell at you over everything. I told them I could only work part time ( less than 15 hours) a week while in school and they still scheduled me in for ore than 20 hours a week.
bad,Need to hire more staff. Wonderful team of people to work with but the company has somethings that  they need to work on like deliveries and installs they have some people in the wrong place and it's not beneficial for the operation of the company.
bad,"Home Depot is not a great place to work as the make it seem. The management lacks experience, the employees lack training, customers expect you to know everything about every product sold. I worked there for 3 years and got $0.35 worth of raises in that time. I was responsible for stocking 3 departments they were plumbing, kitchen and bath, plus millworks (all very large heavy items) for a wage of $9.65 an hour."
bad,If they don't  like you they find a way to get rid of you. It's so sad you can call there 800 number to try and get help. But I feel it's a number that gets rid of you .Home Depot does not like whistle blowers! For me its just not a safe place to work!!!!
bad,"I did not enjoy working at the Home Depot. I was really happy when I was finally able to seek better employment else where. The management is over worked and stressed and is encouraged to make decisions solely based on profit rather than on whether or not people are good employees. Consequently the job is very cut-throat with little to no opportunity for advancement, or full time hours with reasonable wages."
bad,"When trying to get the job you have to go through 3 separate interviews which is insane. Orientation makes Home Depot seem like a great place to work! But after orientation is when the real job starts. Management is the worst i have ever seen. So many employees yet they give you no life balance with insane hours. Job is horrible, and training prepares you for absolutely nothing about what you need to know. You are just thrown out onto the floor and expected to know everything by customers and managers. Could not say enough about how bad of an experience this was. Works 2 months then quit because of bad management, demanding hours, bad customers, and so much more. DO NOT WORK HERE UNLESS YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT."
bad,They very rude never gets help managers reallll rude they doesn’t really care about reasons you not at work or nothing they pay very good but not a job that give a lot of hours
bad,"Order Fullfillment/ Order Puller is a terrible job. Stressful, not supported, overwhelming workload, constant lack of inventory on-hand issues  horrendous software system fraught with problems all this and low, low pay. There are all kinds of really good people at the HD but upper management has been whittling away- ever decreasing the payroll to the point where, in my opinion, it has become absurd. I think upper management has figured out that they have a bi-opoly with Lowes. In other words we can deliver poor customer service (few employees to talk to/help customers, long wait times etc...) and people are still going to shop here. The employee on the floor is overwhelmed with work because payroll has been cut back to give upper management bonuses for the profitabiliy squeezed out of still more payroll expense reduction. Management talks about how online sales and deliveries are the growing part of the business and yet they are only willing to invest in the growing part of the business by offering only $11.00 an hour in pay to someone who is a key component in that plan.It is stressful difficult job to do well and for next to no pay. Run, do not walk away, Run away, save yourselves, RUN!"
bad,Don't have much to say on the good side of Home Depot the Home Depot stock purchasing plan and the Homer fund or great the all-around the Home Depot is not a place for me to work if you're not willing to kiss butt and not make friends you can move up
bad,Was advised they would not do raises more than 20 because of min wage increases. So each year you make the same as a new hire but more responsibility.
bad,"A typical work day consists of standing in the lanes of the cash register in order to greet customers as they walk by. The whole act is superficial and annoying for everyone involved. Furthermore, the cashiers are asked to go to the garden section regardless of the weather which can result in some terrible work days. Management sucks, they expect you to go above and beyond for the customer but then turn around and treat you like dirt. The workplace culture is all about the customer and the employee does not have any real sense of worth or importance. The hardest part of the job would be the non stop sense of having management watch every little thing you do. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out."
bad,"Negligible pay, no hours, benefits or meaningful, comprehensive training.  The majority of actual communication (not modules)  is negative about ""making the store numbers""  instead of informative, constructive interactions and relationships with superiors."
bad,Most of Management is not getting thier hands dirty. They walk around mirco manage people that are doing well. They don't know what thier doing. And when you ask for help they direct you to a supervisor who is over worked and under paid. The co workers try to help with getting customers out and get wrote up for doing extra work. They add responsibilities that your not trained for and writes you up for not knowing.  This job is for a high school student who is looking for a job while looking for something else. Not a carrier. Just a job while you look for something else period.
bad,"Home Depot In Bossier City, LA does not prepare you well for the job. You view videos for several hours which are helpful but does not give you anywhere near the training you need to be successful. Then you are put out on the floor to ""sink or swim"". I ended up literally annoying other associates asking for help and some of them were very helpful. Some not so much. If you ever needed help from an assistant manager, forget it. They were clueless. They had no idea how to help you and no the inclination to do so. They seemed to feel that a managers job was running around barking orders at people. There was no support, very little training and you were expected to always know what to do via ""mental telepathy"". It was a stressful, unprofessional environment. All in all it just wasn't worth $11 an hour at 25 hours a week. Don't waste your time!"
bad,"Some workers tend to hide from productivity, while others get overworked (especially full time employees), and the customers tend to get in the way of everyday operations including off loading any 18-wheeler's, cutting lumber, and restocking of your area. Management sometimes cross manage workers causing friction between other managers and supervisors."
bad,no communication between management and workers. workers feel like pawns controlled by the people in charge. possibly the worst job experience i've had.
bad,"Learned the 2020 drafting program on line, that was the one and only excellent thing about this job."
bad,"> On your feet all day with customer service"
bad,"No follow thru with upper manament. Poor pay.  Too many chiefs not enough indians. Start time is 5am ,meeting then off to work. I change prices in the store for 8 hrs a day,help with general service"
bad,I don’t have much to say about the job. I loved the job itself but the people I worked with werent very good. People stole stuff all the time and no one cared.
bad,"Just another large corporation, and retail job. Compensation and benefits are not good. Culture of the work place is rigid, and does not encourage creativity."
bad,"SO INCONSIDERATE!"
bad,"Horrible place to work, cares only about retail, never about workers. The management was constantly rotating due to inept hiring and firing procedures."
bad,Just wouldnt advise no one to work there it's not a peaceful environment everything is chaos chaotic it's not a place where you want to get up in the morning and go to work I'll get up in the afternoon to to go it is a very respectable environment clean environment Associates that work there a friendly on occasions really not talkative people
bad,"Good if you're a young man looking for quick job advancement, terrible if you're a young woman period, especially if you are younger. I watched male employees get hired next to me and within maybe a couple weeks of being hired they'd be dragged off to some other department. I had to fight to get minimal training for the service desk, and when they wanted to actually hire someone over there they just started training a different associate instead. They don't even offer discounts, they honestly treat employees worse than customers when they try to purchase goods. They would also ALWAYS have the ""now hiring"" sign up, but could never seem to get new associates. Then on top of having a skeleton crew, they'd cut hours all the time."
bad,its a horrible environment filled with higher ups that will eventually stab you in the back. If you are ever planning on working there you need to always watch out for yourself and be weary of those who smile in your face.
bad,"it truly sucks Rate this company*required"
bad,"This job posting is a bait and switch. You apply they call say it no longer available, then try and get you to apply for another position. "
bad,Don't work for this company management sucks and so does HR. Want you to work 24/7 365. You had to tell people where u were on the weekends couldn't leave work phone.
bad,"Construction based job, acquired 5 licenses for machine operation associated with certain tasks which include fork lift, order picker, electric ladder, electric pallet jack and reach truck.. No night shift differential or any type of increase for the knowledge of on site machine licenses. Management had target on peoples backs for any mess ups or just accidents/mistakes. Never hired or promoted anyone that I knew in the multiple stores in the year and a half i was there."
bad,Was a cashier for over 11 years often took on the roll as line manager provided excellent customer service always went above and beyond when i was on the clock
bad,"I had worked for 3 different stores. None of the management was personable or cared about the associates. Veterans are treated like trash even though they are often the hardest working individuals. Profit sharing is ridiculous considering the money the stores and company brings in. You are expected to not have an opinion or bring other experience to the table to help improve processes. I could go on and on, but spare yourself from this terrible company and incompetent management."
bad,"Not paid nearly enough for the amount of work I do. ""Do your job well and you get to do other peoples jobs"" is what it's all about. You work your tail off so supervisor and above can get large bonuses while they give you peanuts."
bad,The Home depot has the Worse Management System in place in certain stores. Absolutely No One follows the quidelines put in place by  the Corporate Off.
bad,"This company may be the golden egg on first glance but once you see that it is every person for themselves you understand."
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of pack downs, customer assistance, driving sales"
bad,"Please don't work here, very stressful and low pay. They expect you to work like a dog and pay you $15 per hour for a job that needs to be paid $18 + ."
bad,I like helping people and learning new experiences. The managers were not very supportive to the workers.  Many workers did not take their jobs serious.
bad,"What I learned is that if the head cashier doesn't like you she can make your life miserable until she can get you fired. I have never been so harassed and unprepared for a big fish in a little pond before. The people I worked with were great, friendly and formed a family bond.. I loved that."
bad,"Don't get me started.  Labor code violations, less than adequate time to do trips to the restroom/lunch/no rest periods at all.  I learned that I didn't fit into their ""culture"".  Many other ex-employees got the benefit of the lawsuit after we won from my initial filing.  I'm proud my name was on the header of the suit."
bad,best place to get your tools at and price estimates for your house upgrade.and its nice atmosphere with nice people. great hours and flexible house as well
bad,"I think the freight team has since been disbanded. At the time the manager was awful, but I believe that he has been fired. I don't know how the company is doing currently, but they are under new management."
bad,Great place for college students but atrocious for senior citizens.  Decisions are bias and discriminatory.  Manager's are retaliatory.  Cronyism is prevalent.
bad,"Over worked and under paid, Never enough people in the store to cover amount of required daily tasking and take care of customers. Compensation was absolute minimal and there was no incentive for growth or enthusiasm. Pay increases were yearly and no more then 3% no matter how hard you strove to be the best at your job. No matter what your review evaluation was, everyone still got a raise. Store associates mentality was to show up, put in your hours as easily as possible and go home."
bad,"Not a good chose for a single parent as at times, without notice, they cut your hours making it impossible to pay rent.  Then they increase it the next month, and this repeats."
bad,Everybody work with each other. Only problem the supervisors and HR are not very understanding to certain situations. A worker kept persuing me and I reported it and they did nothing about. At the end they terminated me and the other worker
bad,"Good people trying hard but not appreciated by managers. There is a lot of frustration among the employees. Some workers not as dedicated to their job , which in turn affects everyone else."
bad,"Basically unless you knew people in higher places than you, you could be denied for advancement and or raises.  When I worked there was highly unorganzied and management didn't really know how to correct the problem which left to Dept managers and usual were turned town on ideas and suggestions."
bad,"I worked there for 2 years, was treated poorly by management, got tasked with the duties of a supervisor without the title or pay of a supervisor, chauvinism and name called seemed to be a must for management, and I was expected to force their credit cards with obscene interest rates onto our customers which I refused to do. Most of the customers were DIYers so it not only didn't make sense to have them open up a credit card but it was cruel. 26% interest is terrible."
bad,"management only cares about the numbers to increase their commission check. manager turnover is crazy, 5 mngrs in a 4 year period and each one wants to run things differently. makes for constant changes in how departments are run."
bad,"Rely heavily on PT employees to do the bulk of the work while under paying FT employees."
bad,"To work for Home Depot is to leave your life behind! Home Depot's aim is to own you! Every week your work schedule is different! It is a terrible co. to work for!!!  The co. does not choose its store managers nor assoc. managers based on people skills, work ethic, or product knowledge. And the overall decline in the work place, and respect for the employee has increased in the past four years"
bad,"This company is not conducive to or support you if you have a family or if you are a student or what have you. If you're not doing what's best for the company than you are on your way out the door. Always short staffed. Women make less than men. Veterans do not get Veterans day, Labor day, or Memorial day off, those are retail holidays. Mandatory Store meetings at 5AM on Sundays, get ready to cheer, ""Bleed Orange!"""
bad,"This is a job that you will not make a living wage. You have no outside life and you get to work every weekend. Forget about Holiday's you will be working them."
bad,would not work here anymore. management was horrible and to advance you pretty much work all hours and do different positions without them giving it you. They like to just dandle a carrot and make you think you can advance but they will use you
bad,"I've worked for The Home Depot for five years, but don't ask myself about sacrifice. The Incorporate has been one of the (worst) experience's in my life. I stayed with the Incorporate for so long believing The Orange promise. The Home Depot is ran like a bunch of middle schoolers and principals. They ""beat up"" on each other just to keep their under paid position's."
bad,"Home depot does not allow for a good job/personal life balance, they schedule people all over the place so that planning anything is pretty much impossible. Management is very aware of the issues within the store but refuse to do anything about it other than look the other way. The upper management team has favorites and protect them even going as far as illegal actions. Customers are allowed to berate employees in front of management with no ramifications. Management allows abuse to employees from customers and other employees. I would never recommend anyone seeking employment to apply to Home Depot."
bad,"There are too many things wrong with this company. It's just a penny-pinching group of hacks. You get a whopping $0.20 raise every year. That's right, 20 cents. The only bonus you get is called a ""success sharing"" check which fluctuates based on your position, seniority, and how much of your sales plan you covered over a six month period. So if your store doesn't hit sales plan at all then you'll probably get a lovely $40 bonus. This was implemented in place of $1.00 raises per year. The only thing this company wants to see is you kissing a customer's butt. You can get away with little to no tasking as long as you walk around and talk to customers. There are multiple types of lift equipment you can get trained on to use to bring merchandise down from the overhead space but the nice thing is there is zero incentive, as in no pay raise or any form of compensation, to get licensed to drive any of this equipment.This is only a fraction of what is wrong with the company."
bad,"Where could I begin, first off its been awhile since I worked there which was 2011-2013 and the management was the most god awful thing about the location. A lot of down time for sure.working as a lot associate was very, very slow. Hardly anybody showed up customer wise. I hope and pray they have gotten rid of some of the management. GM was nice though, since I had worked with him in Plymouth MN."
bad,i worked at home depot for nearly two years over night and they were very under staffed and showed poor leader ship while always expecting more from a over worked staff
bad,"Hours are horrible because they dont give over time, and no set schedules. I learned nothing. Management was awful and inconsistent. I wouldnt recommend Home depot to people that are serious about making money. This a job fit for high school or beginner jobs."
bad,They have shift bids and there is zero job security. They also have limited vacation time and its very hard to go to doctor appointments. They did have a cafeteria and nice break rooms though.
bad,"ne recommande pas cette compagnie "
bad,If your a good worker they will pile more and more jobs on you to make up for the lazy people because they're too afraid to manage lazy people because the lazy people will tell corporate on them for making them do their job. Stay away from this corporation all together even buying products from them they don't stand by their product they just tell you to call corporate and they give you the run around until you give up. Smokers are allowed to take 6 smoke breaks in an 8 hr shift because some management are smokers. Took 2 months to get hired in don't bother applying.
bad,Very busy place to work. Keeps you busy with customers daily. Its a very fast paced place. I only work there part-time so its not really much. Would like more pay.
bad,"Terrible place to work for any one, management is a joke at best and HR is highly uncooperative, bosses will take any opportunity to emotionally abuse you and will get away with it, bosses will also discriminate against you for any thing EG: appearance, music preference, clothing. Bosses will also threaten to fire you if they feel you are better than them or you stand up to them. Horrible place to work, corporate does nothing to help."
bad,I left this job because I felt uncomfortable in the work environment. horrible management and communication between management.
bad,"The managers are usually to busy being social then focus on actual work, and most of the time they don't know what they are doing or why. The micro management is ridiculous and the peer interaction is hostile. Management doesn't communicate well to floor members and most of them are rude."
bad,"Management at this establishment treated employees in a rude  manner. After working at this location for two years, and being promoted I did not feel like a valued employee. Management was rude and unpleasant."
bad,Management sucks. They advance if you become likeable and kiss their tails. Theyae prejudice biggts. They set their cashiers up for stealing and let the customer walk out with thousands of dollars in merchandise. The manager sucks and the hiring person is nthing but an a kisser she will sab you i the back. This job ws a disasters. All wrong. Not a good job.
bad,"a circus, no real direction, no real leadership in management. set up for failure. no work life balance. No trust among management. CHEAP GM"
bad,"There's just nothing good to say."
bad,"The job is basically what you make it to be. Its a job to have, not a career, because the have there favorites and don't work to show gratitude to the real hard working employees"
bad,Pay is good for store manager. Options or stock grants stink. Benefits are among the worst in the market... Would not recommend you work there.
bad,"There is to much emphasis placed on making sure everyone is getting along with  everyone else.  If there is an issue presented, actions will be taken based on how well you are liked, and not your performance."
bad,i worked for the company for eight months it was great company to work for you can easily move up they have great programs they offer
bad,Low pay super hard work not flexible with schedule always cutting hrs and no way to get full time work. benefits to expensive for what you earn greedy managers
bad,I was a great employee who within my first year was number one in the entire company for the sales of their Adopt-a-SKU. My reward for this accomplishment was to be transferred to a new store where the management team used intimate knowledge of my PTSD to make me so emotionally distraught that I wound up back in a mental hospital.
bad,The Home Depot did not show much room for advancement within the company. A typical day at work was very hectic as most of the time I was alone. I did learn many skills from the tools and products that are stocked. The hardest part of the job is management. Management does not seem to appreciate the hard working individuals that are employed with The Home Depot. The most enjoyable side of the job was seeing the satisfaction in the customers as they leave.
bad,Its unfortunately that the company is to coorporate and not more compassionate for their hard working employee's that are struggling to make a living
bad,"Working for The Home Depot was the worst experience of my life. As a merchandiser, you already have people hating you, because the ""store associates"" believe that you don't do much and took part of their job. On top of that, I had a manager who forced me to work 10 hours in a gas leak, and that wasn't even the worst of what she did to her associates. Two of my co-workers got hurt on the job and instead of writing a report, she told them that if they called hr to make a report that she would fire them. I should mention, I worked for the Night Merch crew. So not only did you have a horrible boss, but if you called hr, they didn't listen. I personally called them 3 times while others on my team called at least 5 a piece. The Home Depot is a horrible company that would rather listen to a terrible manager than the voices of ALL her associates."
bad,"Management consistently insists on unreasonable completion of tasks within short time lines.  Department Heads are merely regular associates with additional responsibilities that get blamed for everything that goes wrong in their departments, even when management makes unreasonable mandates.  They are consistently understaffed and overworked and taken for granted and it is impossible to do enough for the demanding management team."
bad,"Low volume store, low morale, poor management, a bunch of bitter caged rats. Unqualified Supervisors.  Understaffed...  Run away!"
bad,"I have never been with a company so disorganized and biased with employees. Never accommodating, and there were always employees coming and going."
bad,"Although Home Depot offers ways to move up in the company, they don't recognize the hard workers and the ones who go above and beyond to take care of the customers needs.  "
bad,Have the ability to work with a diverse group of individuals (coworkers and customers) in a fast paced setting with minimal supervision.
bad,"the summary explains it all, I lifted something heavy slightly tweaked my back and they gave me an ultimatum to maybe be fired if I didn't pass the safety test they were gonna setup for ya which you would be fired  that's a quote btw if you didn't pass the test IN THIER EYES or to quit now"
bad,"I worked for the North Store for some time. You may experience friendliness and appreciation for the first three months but that's about it. This store as many of us referred to as the ""mans club"". Management will throw you under the bus if given the opportunity. They say family is important but don't let something come up on the day your scheduled at work. The conditions on the floor are very hostile. There is no room for advancement unless they ""like"" you. Persons l worked with wanted to learn different departments and were turned down not because of their skills but by popularity, if the department supervisor didn't like you, they would bury your application. Your considered expendable. Good luck if you decide to apply for this position."
bad,Management is horrible. The compensation for the amount of work is laughable. There is favoritism and lack of professionalism. Amount of stress they put you under is not worth it. I will never work for or advocate this company as long as I live.
bad,"If you're looking for something to live on, and want to move up, be ready to wait a while.  The company is looking to spend as little on its associates as possible.  Management has little interest in motivation or morale.  My coworkers were mostly alright though."
bad,"A day could start out with zero to a few smoldering campfires and end up a towering inferno!!"
bad,"Required to mix paint colors for customers as well as provide various products within the paint department. This required knowledge of all  products sold in the department in order to provide what customer needs to complete there project. I enjoyed helping customers and learning about various products. "
bad,"The thought of not doing anything at work and getting paid is nice, but after a while, it gets old.  I had a 10pm - 5:30am shift, we were essentially done before 1am, I got yelled at for leaving when the 1am ers left.  Why would I want to work when I have better things to do?  One associate on the other end of the warehouse suggested I sit in the breakroom from 1am - 4pm because noone will notice even though there was no work.  I did just that for about 3 weeks.  Enough is enough."
bad,The management is this  particular store needs to be trained how to perform their jobs.  I enjoy meeting new people and to providing the best customer service.  My co-workers are very nice and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is not having any cooperation from the management.  The big deal is made in orientation about how this company puts the management below the associates is not true.  The most enjoyable part of my job is just being able to help the customers.
bad,Job is physically demanding and not enough pay.  No opportunity to advance or competitive pay. No flexible schedules.  Attendance policy overrated.
bad,the scheduled hours at home depot were so low I could no longer support my family I made good wage which is why my hours were cut to save money
bad,"Lots of hard work, if that's what your looking for.  Manage will not hire more employee causing everyone to work much harder."
bad,Worst Company I have every worked for. My job is a very simple cleaning job but always made to be like your saving the world.  They love to drag everything out and make it more difficult than it should be.  There is no respect for you from anybody there.
bad,"For a company that claims they will not tolerate racist behaviour there is an awful lot of it going on there. I was fired the second they found out that I a white male was dating a black lady.  "
bad,Management is terrible. They have no respect for seasoned workers and show favoritism. Hours are great for a student but not for someone with a family. A very gossipy environment.
bad,"As a part-time, shift are were very irregular, so work/life balance was horrible. Learned a lot about building materials. Management was horrible. Most coworkers are lazy. The hardest part of the job was ""the customer is always right"" and watching how managers let customers literally yell at your face."
bad,"Great team of people i work with, fast paced.They don't give enough hours time to look for another job that is better geared to what i have gone to school for."
bad,This is the worst company to ever work for. They make so much money but don't pay you anything. There is no communication skills and you have no chance at having any advancement unless you kiss a**. The only good part about this job was the food during the holidays.
bad,"working hard , the job was great but co-workers was something"
bad,"They promote outside of the company.  I had managers who knew nothing about the job I did. So when I had a customer who wanted to speak with a Sup no one would take the call or ask you to get a name and # and they will call them back.  Also when requesting vacation time off no one cares about why you want time off.  You can request a week off to go out of town and they might only approve one day.  You have to put in for vacation time one day at a time.  The Scheduling dept will not speak with you but you can email them and pray for a response. And there is little to no seniority, I busted my butt for two years and got No where. They hire in some people as Gm rep and some as MA reps and some as duel.  This mean you can work there for two yrs as a MA rep and a new employee can come in and be trained as a dual and pass you up.  You have no control over what they train you as just depends on the business.  I have worked at a call center before and this was the worse!!"
bad,"i worked as a seasonal cashier, then i was ""let go"" afterwards any and all attempts at getting rehired at direct part time were futile."
bad,HR is very unorganized and can barely do his job. He often comes of as rude when trying to talk to him about anything from work related issues to the weather.
bad,"This was one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. The ""Job"" presented is complete c.rap. All you do is clean and scrub and fix things in bays, it is not fun, it is not worth the measly little few dollars they throw at you."
bad,This place was wonderful once. That's why I wasted 5 1/2 years here. Then the store manager changed and so did the district manager. If you don't kiss the right booty you WILL be fired. Even if your 9 mo. Pregnant. They will find something on you. Then they will target any relative you have there to get them out too. I used to consider this place my second home and my fellow employees were my family but come to find out there were a bunch of two faced department supervisors watching my every move. When I was fired the store manager had a smirk on his face NO REMORSE what so ever. But now I'm free from pointless changes in rules snarky comments from management or pointless babbling from the store manager about himself and how awesome he is. The ridiculous crazy hours and having to stay late because nothing got accomplished while the store manager hid out in his office. I recommend if you take a job here document everything! That way you can sue them for wrongful termination because at this place it is a sport. Usually 3 people a month.
bad,"Don’t be lured in with their lies. They will tell you that there is room to grow with the company because they are expanding. They will tell you that you might even become a store manager and have your own store one day, but the truth is that they are not expanding but in fact closing stores, so much so, that some of the corporate higher up have jumped ship and have transferred to the parent company which is The Home Depot. The strategy is to get bodies into the store to cover shifts because it’s very hard to keep people employed once they realize the mess they have gotten into. "
bad,"Management is not loyal to ANY employees. They will get rid of you, especially if you are a long term employee by making your work/life balance unbalanced to the extreme forcing you to quit, and replace you with a new lower paid employee. They are underhanded and will undermine you whenever they can and are not honest with you when asked about your position with the company. Turnover is HIGH as morale is always LOW. BEWARE!!"
bad,I found the work life boring  and they cyclical through employees fast.
bad,"I had a very honest and consise review until my browser crashed, so ill try and start all over. IMO you will not find a more physically demanding job in any retail box. I'm a bottom feeder ""lot associate"" (when did this ""associate"" moniker replace ""employee""? WE ARE ALL EMPLOYEES, PLAIN & SIMPLE). As a ""lot associate"" you WILL be considered the b***h of the entire box with at 3 so-called managers asking for you to cover all loading needs, which falls under customer service, throughout the store with not co-worker offering to help. Expect to be dedicated to the Pro Desk, front end (checkout) and the service desk. Count how many pocketpool champions there are watching you running around the store with absolutely no offer to help and you'll blood will boil. The POS Pro Desk manager is as worthless as they come; he used a forklift to bring a pallet of 80# of Quikrete to load into the customers small trailer..the customer asked for each bag to be handstacked and since we're all about customer service this POS Pro desk manager (laziest employee in the box) looked me in the face and left it for me and the customer to unload!!"
bad,"Did not like the management team. Co-workers, some of them were good friends, most of them were loud. The hardest part was dealing with bad customers. And the good customers was the enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"a lot of standing around, most customers are nice. the best part of this job is the end of my shift. management scheduals shifts for 8 plus hrs at a time. which is to much standing around for one person."
bad,"It's a fast pace retail environment. Management never gives you credit for the good, They only point out the bad. This company doesn't care if you have a family or even if your kid is sick. They will tell you to find someone else that can be with your kid. They will make your work even if you have pink eye. They level of service to the customers has gone down hill because their doing away with ALL full time employees. Meaning no one on the sales floor to help the customers. They have a dress code in place, but if your the managers favorite you can wear whatever you want, dye your hair whatever color, but others get suspended till their hair is a normal color. Their raises are either 1, 2, or 3% of whatever you make."
bad,This was one of the lowest paid with higher expectations the expensive benefits. Overall this is a terrible place to work the company treats the department managers with no respect and as if the entire stores progress is never good it treats employees as slaves. I would never suggest this company as a place to work. The coworkers are like dogs who have been kicked to much nice people in a stressful job.
bad,This is a place that i have experienced and plan not to be around again
bad,"Unless you like being treated like a sub-human, don't work here. "
bad,"store was open for long hours, the shifts weren't the greatest but when you are a student, it worked out. "
bad,My review for this company is overall not strong.  Not a great job to advance in.  Pay is very uncompetitive.
bad,"Every customer I came into contact with was unhappy, not enough employees, angry employees that would not help the front end customers when needed, disgruntled management that didn't want to help customers. Management defending employees against customers was a regular event. I learned despite not enjoying this place to work, that I love home improvement projects."
bad,"Management liked to bully people, they were not nice to there employees at all. They need to find better cashier supervisers"
bad,management is horrible and the lack of hours is outrageous. the benefits doesn't help at all and is very expensive
bad,"Don't waste your time with this company. No room for advancement. The management does not care about their employees, to them you are just a number. My manager refused to let me off for my wifes baby doctor appointments. He also wrote me up for missing work,even though I called out 24to hours in advance, to attend court(a family member was murdered)."
bad,"Didn't enjoy my experience working at Home Depot. Lots of favortism lies back dooring and new managers who bring in their own people from other stores to take you position you earned. Store #222 in Davie Fl is GOD aweful .I am glad i am no longer a part of their team after 6 years of loyalty they kinda bullied me and blacked balled me so i couldn't get a better position so they can keep me at nights. Management always said it was an open door policy and if you spoke up you were never going to get any position you wanted or even be considered. I am very happy i am no longer their and it was definately the worst job i've ever had. Would rank it lower but there isn't a minus rating!! EX.. Had a pack down specialist position, Had it for 2 years then they said they eliminated it. Week later it was giving to someone else who step down as DH. He had no experience and no liesences. This is typical moves from management"
bad,"This was one of my worst work experiences. The annual raises were always either none to avg of 8-12 cents per hr raise entire time I was there. I excelled in customer service,received 18 customer excellance awards and even 2 presidential awards during my 2 1/2 yrs there. I was the only saw operator able to insure precision cuts every time and deliver.I needed to transfer to another store due to high cost of fuel and a recent move.I was told could transfer from 100 oaks store to smyrna store and keep my current rate of pay and full time hrs with benefits. Once transferred was told everyday from assigned start date had no hours for me,come back tomorrow this continued for almost 2 wks and finally allowed to work for 22 hrs of 40 promised and scheduled for but kept getting told not enough work to keep me on entire 8 hr night-go home,by end of 3rd wk and only 20 hrs in 3 wks came in clocked in on time and got to wk 2 hrs of 8 which made 22 and called into office and told was let go due to customer complaint. When asked for what and by whom complaint came from and which mgr talked to customer,was told never mind,go home.When insisted they pull video to support their claims that I walked away from customer refusing to help him after argument supposedly occured they said they did not feel they owed it to me to produce any such video even though do run video 24/7 in all isles of store.Told me they didn't need me their nor want me there. I did some research and found out I was making $1.75-$2.50 per hr more than any other employee and managers their because I came from higher paying"
bad,"Assist customers in finding what they needed for home improvement/repair or find them someone who could help them if I could not. I trained and certified on the use of the forklift. Stocked all items available, set displays, did weekly inventory in dept. as an assist to Department Head. Trained and certified for Kitchen Design."
bad,I'm a current student who goes to school full time and the management does not care to help accommendate with my school schedule at all. They only want you commit your whole entire life to THE HOME DEPOT which is completely unfair.
bad,Days were really long and employees were very difficult to work with. I learned how to deal with people who are not nice or very over barring. I did enjoy dealing with the customers I got to speak spanish and get better at skills I needed to fine tune.
bad,"Worst job I ever had. Unhealthy and unreasonable working condition, multiple store seasonal changes, no ventilation I restroom facilities. Dishonest and rude customers, corporate mngmt ignorant and overbearing, unreasonable. Two holidays per year."
bad,"Constantly changing shifts and schizophrenic management, but most (98%) associates are a pleasure to work with."
bad,Dead end job!!!...Managements only goal is to save money to make their bonus bigger!!
bad,"Bad pay for what they ask of you. Poor management at my store. Bad hours. Pay alot for health benefits. I liked my coworkers, good people. Garden is the only area of the store that I would work. Outside and with mostly happy customers looking for solutions to enjoyable projects."
bad,"A typical day at work entails helping customers with their purchases, providing answers about the product they're interested in and stocking shelves."
bad,"They take take and take until you have nothing left to give. Then they get rid of you as fast as they can. From the moment you are hired then the talk starts, you will get fired for that or fired for this. They work you at ungodly hours, your life is not your own. They abuse the system how ever they can. Work you 16 hrs on day and tell you to cut it the next day so they don;'t have to pay OT."
bad,"It was ok, in to work early out early and off on weekends. meeting new people was an highlight."
bad,"They don’t care about you or anything but money. They pay garbage. I worked there for 2 years, and in that time, they said they could only afford to give a 35-cent raise. The “managers” were some of the most arrogant, disrespectful people I’ve ever met. The store owner told us we were all getting a bonus, and then said during a store meeting the equivalent of, “Oops, my bad.” One of the worst and most disrespectful companies I’ve ever had the displeasure of doing dirty work for"
bad,"It will take you a whole 20 years when your able to get to the compensation that you deserve. Company isn’t fair in how they give out raises. Some people come to work and get paid for nothing, because nothing is what they do."
bad,"The work was ok. My immediate supervisor was great. The days and hours changed every week and there was little advance notice. Not much of a dress code, no shorts below the knee. But the environment was extremely uncomfortable. N word said often. Can only be a good person if a Christian.  Immigrants only come in to make trouble. People with disabilities should stay home. Expressing concern about about the expression of opinions and comments showing antipathy toward different peoples,beliefs, etc,  is not allowed or is punished."
bad,I know getting injuries are inevitable but with Home Depot you get seriously injured and they will get rid of you even if your on workman’s comp. I tore my lower back muscle and they tried to make me bend and twist when I wasn’t supposed to. My doctor further said to stay out so I didn’t further hurt my back and they fired me almost instantly
bad,"When you want someone to know something be specific"
bad,Tell the male management and leaders to stop have frolicking relationship with the female employees and to be fair to all employees across the board give us the right wages that we deserve treat us like we mean something to the company I'm not liking number or prisoners
bad,"If you like being put in a box, this is for you. If you value the shareholders and senior management profits and bonuses, this place is for you. Not me. This is a big retail chain that stays open everyday except 2 per year. No family life or free time.  Go to BJ’s , Amazon..."
bad,"as a home service specialist we're treated as non-home depot personnel, even tho we are Home Depot assoicates.  we get no training and no support.  sales managers at the district and regional level don't support us.  we're told no we can not use or do this or that to market ourselves or the products we told to market.  and they don't provide us any marketing material and we (as Home Depot assoicates) can not use Home Depot marketing material because they're for Home Depot associates.  WHAT????"
bad,"The female managers at this location are the epitome of ""peaking in high school."" They often displayed the behavior of teenage bullies, engaging with those around them as if they were in a high school cafeteria. The managers would speak disparagingly about other managers, department leads, and employees within earshot of the employees themselves, in hopes that the trash talk would be heard. "
bad,"Toxic environment, Management and leadership have a top-down look at the employees. They are non-technical but politicians looking for you their own benefits. "
bad,the management is terrible and they treat the good employees terrible and bad employees they dont care about the home depot rdc looks for reasons to fire you after time has passed they may be a good company but youd be miserable the entire time they dont want you talking and treat you like kids and like your in a prison the only positive is some of the prople are friendly
bad,"Poor management and poor management skills amongst the management team and the supervisory teams. None have any motivational or team building skills. Majority of the team has worked for Home depot for their entire career and do not have any other skills. Lots of discrimination, intimidation and aggression towards new associates with better experience"
bad,"The management doesn't care about safety, health, or situation that an employee is in.   They don't care about their workers at all.   I've never worked for a worse company.   I can't speak for the receiving department, or the truck loading department. But coming from the shipping don't bother with them."
bad,"I’ve worked for Home Depot in Seattle and Austin. You can’t trust anything they say. Management will give you a promise of full time but never deliver. The culture is backstabbing.only the worst of the employees get somewhere.the good,hardworking ones they tend to find a way to get rid of.those who have injuries,surgeries or disability catch a hard time.the pay is extremely poor for the work.if you don’t fit in then they get rid of you.they don’t give notice on schedule changes."
bad,"I speak on behalf of others, you are not appreciated as an employee.  When I first started working there I won prizes for sales, I got Cashier of the month for great customer service. However, I won a monetary reward which I was promised but never received. Then I won a contest, we were supposed to all go out to eat as the reward..they canceled that to  The Mgmt has their nose up in the air because they are a ""manager""..oooh this is retail folks, lead by example and stop thinking you are all CEO's of the company!   Your rudeness and lack of leadership don't go unnoticed by others! T Managers have no empathy. The store manager gives out illegal info on his past employees when outside jobs call to verify employment.    The store mgr assumes why associates quit and provides that info to the job they are trying to obtain.  Home Depot loses all my respect as a company.  I say  do a class action lawsuit !!! This company "
bad,"Home Depot first of all is an ableist organization - not taking into account people with differences when awarding promotions and upgrades to full-time work. "
bad,"Your safety is our first priority - False"
bad,I worked at the store support center in Atlanta as Sr Director. The services division is great but has horrible management at the VP level are the worse vp’s ever! Favoritisms and the good old boy network lives strong here especially if you are a female or are a minority
bad,One good manager at my store that makes people feel appreciated and actually coaches associates toward success.  Extremely high turnover makes it hard to stay connected to your team and actually accomplish anything.
bad,"Top-down culture with management it's okay for them to make elitist and racist jokes but you cannot turn them in without fear of reprisal. "
bad,"Terrible place to work, back stabbers everywhere, God forbid you work outside in rain and snow and get pneumonia, when you take 2 days off they can you, and guess what, you are stuck with all the medical bills. Don't wish this place on anyone."
bad,"Working at the Call Centers was a very unprofessional experience. Working at the Headquarters was more professional but very shady. Could not trust peers or managers. There was not a lot of ""work life balance"". The call centers do not provide many options for holiday breaks. Headquarters was cold and very cut throat. Definitely the worst place I have worked."
bad,"I worked for Home Depot Interiors for a year and four months as a Measure Tech."
bad,Terminated for writing down a license plate number from a known shoplifter. Home Depot fired 4 exceptional employees for doing the right thing as a concerned citizen . Look the other way because if you don’t you will be terminated for violating company policy .  So don’t be a model citizen and let everyone shoplift and look the other way and don’t get involved. You’ll be fired !!!
bad,"It’s a very okay place to work once your a bit older, they rope you in with this idea of “team” and you never feel more alone once you get into the flow of things, managers don’t talk to you as much, don’t ask you questions. Attendance policy there makes no sense. You acquire a full point for being just one minute late, you also get a full point if you just call in to work? A point stays on your record for 6 months"
bad,"The interview was literally 5 minutes, and then a few days later hired/orientation. "
bad,"I was there 2 1/2 years and the customers were never a problem- the management was.  We had a GM who would come in bragging about his new $75,000 truck or $150,000 RV or family vacation to Disney World, etc- all while us lowly employees who provided the hard work that earned him massive bonuses lived paycheck to paycheck- often having to choose between food on the table or gas in the car. This guy easily made $150,000 a year and was a total dolt. Ex military and barked orders at us like we were too. I can't believe he's still there and can't wait for the day when they finally let him go.  It's inevitable.  Just wish I could see it.  But am so much happier outside of that hellhole."
bad,"Most of my coworkers made it a joy to work there.  We supported each other emotionally.  Because we were all in a financial bind and that’s why we were at Home Depot.  No one was thinking about having a career with Home Depot because the managers did not respect their employees, they were very unorganized and the managers were morale busters."
bad,"This is a retail environment. Your pay reflects your value to the company."
bad,Honestly the worst company I have ever worked at. Constantly being harassed by customers and some employees. Pay is awful and sometimes will be scheduled outside your availability (which sucks when you're a student). You HAVE to work a weekend day.
bad,"When I started with the company in 2015 there was almost a visible energy around the building. Everyone was excited and happy to come to work. The building manager regularly walked the warehouse floor engaging with everyone. He knew everybody's name and remembered everything they'd discussed. They regularly fed everyone or had celebrations. Over the years that gradually changed. The supervisors lost their smiles. The replacement building manager hid in his office, only leaving when he had to. Yearly cullings began to occur, where batches of associates were terminated with the flimsiest of reasons. My last year there was probably the worst. I watched them terminate wonderful associates with forged paperwork and harsh overreactions. I myself was subjected to two of these overreactions, which prompted me to leave the company. The work itself isn't too bad. Unload trailers, throw freight, load trailers. It's physical but can occasionally be rewarding. If you're lucky enough to find a facility with managers who care about your well-being, you can stay there for years and years. Those facilites, however, are few and far between."
bad,"Regret all the toxins I exposed myself too working with tgus company my 2nd day the manager dropped a metal crate on me and watched the whole thing and didnt ask if I was okay he only blurted out ""are you bleeding"""
bad,Management does not care about the workers. The work is to extreme with not enough support from supervisors and proper training for situatio sare not given
bad,"Whatever you do, do not apply to be a lot associate. Everyone including cashiers will treat you like dirt. You will be the hardest working associate in the entire store and get paid the same amount as someone who stands around with their thumb up their butt all day long. I have met some of the worst co-workers here at The Home Depot."
bad,"Home Depot's excellent reputation as an employer seems to be based off the company's behavior in the past, and doesn't really apply anymore and certainly not to younger employees."
bad,"With absolute bottom minimum wage paid for most levels of positions, complete lack of training (expectations are at pro level though ), hostile work culture,  and a huge barrier to upwards growth regardless of skill or time put in, I would highly avoid this company and go to any other retail as  HD is way behind in terms of compensation, or any growth potential ."
bad,Management does not care one bit about employees. Company is very profit and credit focused. No one listens to concerns or addresses issues. Management only cares about the job you do if it makes them look bad. Currently work in 4 departments and still paid 11 a hour it's ridiculous. Store is very short staffed and you as an employee have no resources to effectively do your job.
bad,"If you were to get hired at The Home Depot, good luck. management is so horrible, they DO NOT care about their associates whatsoever. most head managers and supervisors are ALWAYS in the back doing nothing when they claim to be doing ""paperwork"". Asm's give attitude when called for help, supervisors get annoyed when you call them as well. Most Asm's make you feel so small and like you're in the wrong for asking a questions when they specifically say in the beginning of training 'there are no stupid questions."" All of the managers would go on lunch together leaving this poor girl doing everything by herself and I give her props, she handles the store better than the actual store manager. Home Depot is a complete joke."
bad,"Worked here for over half a year. The only good thing about this place is your fellow coworkers. The pay is low compared to places literally next door. Theyll work you 40+ hours as a part timer without full time benefits, theyve put underage workers in places they shouldnt work, theyve fired people for sick days, they deny religious day requests, theyre constantly understaffed, despite being told. Honestly a terrible place to work."
bad,I worked for them for many years I made a decent salary only because I was there  when they gave much higher raises the nice raises dissapeared the last 7 yrs I was there it went to 10cent and 5cent raises I was great at sales and knew how to help people and was barely recognized for it even when I sold over 30 million in a year they give shared bonuses only if they make there sales quotas managers some are good some are horrible but it's a club and very hard to get anywhere unless you become a manager pet. For at least 2yrs minimum. Home Depot used to care about the employees and the customers now 15 to 20 years ago now it's a corporate mess. I should have left when the higher raises stopped. The last three years I worked there I was basically hunted to be terminated. So it was very stressful. And a horrible experience I would not wish on my worst enemy.
bad,"The pay isn’t very good it’s minimum wage. Like most jobs they don’t want to pay well and yet expect everything from you and more. The store on mount Vernon seems dysfunctional due to how they treat their employees. Honestly give people respect and alittle appreciation and the store would be better."
bad,"The Home Depot wants you to be loyal to the company, but they will not be loyal to you at all. Once they want to get rid of you they will find something to fire you."
bad,Didn’t like the place at all they treat u like a dog in that place 14 15 hrs for 10$ a hour treat u a slave not s job to b at all the manager team don’t care
bad,do not have any option on this company and would not like to make a comment about them I have nothing to say about them and would be happy if I wasn't asked
bad,"If you like to help customers, Home Depot can work for you, but you first must be willing to be micro-managed and treated as a number vs a productive, experienced, trained human."
bad,I worked my tail off and learned more than full time people could do. Yet i was repeatedly turned down full time. I was always given lame excuse. Lack of customer experience. But i had 20 years in retail. They promote their favorites like their click. And part time can work more hours until they realize it and knock you down to 20 hours.
bad,Just another place where they progress people through shmoozing not hard work. Performing well only guarantees you will be stuck in your position. Pay was decent.
bad,$11 an hour is what the start everyone at with a 10 cent raise every 6 month.  Only management and kitchen designers make more.  But if you like to be underpaid despite your experience level this is the place for you.
bad,"Management all bleeds orange & thinks telling a customer “we’re The Home Depot & #1” will get sales... meanwhile the 1st interview is with a person in India (they say Atlanta) & they’ll tell you, no using your personal car past 30 miles a day, then you start and get sent to appointments 147 miles away & get no compensation, besides told “way to be a team player” (although you lost $18 in gas & made $0.00 pay)"
bad,"Management seems to be friendly, but after a few months there, you start to see the flip side. I had a workplace injury that was caused by repetitive motion. Upon informing management of my injury and applying for workers comp, I was pulled into thier office for a ""meeting"". They then put me on a final warning and said that I had broken safety regulations. All in all I'd say management does not care about thier employees and will do anything neccessary to cover thier behinds. If I could give the home depot a 0/5 rating I would, but unfortunately they make you fill in at least 1 star."
bad,This job was less than amazing. Management was nothing to speak of. I hated waking up and going to work. It was miserable. Management was never consistent in what they wanted
bad,"Very high expectations and low pay.  Often not enough help in each department to be able to service all the customers."
bad,Home Depot hires anyone who can pass a drug test and hold their stupidity in for the length of an interview.  Then pay those idiots to walk around while the people in receiving and overnights do all the real work for the same pay till they've had enough and leave.
bad,"Was great the first year I worked here, the front end DS actually cared and took the time to listen to you I'd you had any problems but since the new DS it's been a nightmare, He doesnt listen or take any steps to problem solve, You constantly get called in and if you say no they make it sound like you're really inconveniencing them. Avoid this place, because you dont get paid enough for what you have to deal with from customers and other staff"
bad,I gathered that seasonal manager bonus amounts are directly connected to employee injuries so to discourage acceptance of injury complaints. I was told by a manager there that he was only willing to accept a work related injury report if it involved bleeding or unconsciousness.
bad,Bad company. Lack of morals. Very high turnover rate. Employees are bullies and can't keep their hands to themselves. Mangers are no help. Plus tax fraud.  None working registers. No calls no shows. Working 95 plus degrees in the garden with no bathroom breaks or any breaks.
bad,"Comienza bien, todo termina mal. Existen favoritismos"
bad,"They are great about hiring people on, but after a while you realize why, and it's because they have to do that often. Many lot associates wouldn't stay longer than a few months and for obvious reasons. They are understaffed pretty much constantly, are given too little pay for the amount of work we're required to do and anyone part time is pretty much s.o.l if they need a day off. Calling out ahead of time makes no difference as you still get written up. I would only recommend if you're happy being stuck pushing carts and not advancing until you're ready to leave the company altogether."
bad,"Too much heavy lifting, and lots work for low pay. I will not go back to work there, or I will recommend anyone work there because low pay and heavy work."
bad,"Though the team was a great team, the management was not about work/life balance. The associates work WAY to hard there, for very little compensation."
bad,Dishonest ex cons put in mngment over decent hard working people. Preferential treatment. Discrimination and harrassment against women on the floor. Mngment turns a blind eye when reported. Worse place ive ever worked at.
bad,Management is terrible and childish has no communication skills. Basically told me they didnt care if i dropped dead. Nobody is professional.  They tell confidential information and major gossip.  But its a good place to work if you dont ever get sick or have a serious health issue.
bad,Management go out thing working associates for a little better pay for associates and they don’t don the about people steeling there stuff u work it off while other over there siting in management office goofing around and still get paid one head cashier is rude and the coach is a hipócrita
bad,"A company as tenured as Home Depot, one might think it operates efficiently and associates are well compensated. Quite tje opposite is true indeed. Lack of organization cause work to be done two amd three times. The Pay is absurd at the entry level and dept supervisor level. Raises are annual an rarely exceed $.30. That's 30 cents. Generally speaking the work environment is not conducive to high productivity or totally safe for that matter. Not recommended"
bad,"I worked for 9 years at HD because I needed the job. The job kept me fit because I averaged 15,000 steps a day & I'm not a young person. Standing at all times, bending, lifting, climbing ladders. Annual increases are truly insulting. Excellent annual reviews earned me an increase of 30 cents an hour. This is an unfullfilling place to work."
bad,No organization structure and bully management with employees in dark cramped quarters.  It's pretty terrible.  No opportunity for advancement.  The employees are encouraged to compete and no promotions come from within.  All outside hires that ruin moral.  They've NEVER hired a Black Woman to a permanent design position.  Ever.
bad,"The schelduling is all over the place. "
bad,"Management does not know how to run the store."
bad,The work environment was okay. It could be stressful at times.  The supervisory and management team needs more training in stores across some of the states would contribute greatly to associate retention.
bad,Can't have fun and joke around with anyone cause they get butthurt. They want you to go above and beyond what the job calls for but won't pay you for your worth.
bad,Senior management is horribly rude. They think they own you. They get away with creating a hostile work environment and are not held accountable. References of hourly associates being “window lickers” is the norm. Middle management is abused and never supported. Hourly associates are held to unattainable standards. Would NEVER recommend being middle management at this company. It’s about the almighty follar and never about work life balance.
bad,"Absolutely loved my job for 13 years in South Florida, then made the mistake of transferring to North Central Florida. My salary was too high for the region and they let me go within a few months. Manager and assistant managers lied to me and said I had a security violation, but refused to show me on the security recording. Trumped up charges to let me go."
bad,"I worked at a specialist and only on the weekends. I could never count on the mangers for help. Everytime I called to ask for assistance they gave me vague instructions and quickly hung up. One of them would give me an attitude. They are not the least bit flexible with how many hours you want to work or when you want to work. They don't pay you commission, but you have to meet a salee quota. Some of the other specialist are rude. This place just plain sucks to work at."
bad,"Los jefes hacen propiciar un mal ambiente de trabajo, trabajas practicamente 9 o 10 horas, no te dan uniformes, los gerentes no impulsan a tu superacion,  no quiern ni que saludes a los demas porque segun ya estas platicando y perdiendo el tiempo"
bad,Companies that are able to make their employees feel valued and satisfied with their work tend to have a more productive workforce. Anyone who has frequented a Home Depot can see the 'results' of how associates are 'valued and satisfied'.
bad,Difficult place to work: very clickish and extremely Political...Many staffers have been employed 20+ years and allow very little room for advancement.
bad,But home depot -head office at Ellesmere road -Ontario has no job security at all...they won't give even short leaves for very important reasons with proof too...and they will just randomly fire anyone anytime...but they will still lack employees and keep needing new employees and fire them too later....or fire the experienced ones
bad,"Poor management. Vile people. Low pay however extremely high benefits packages. I used to love it, but if you’re not sleeping with one of the managers you will not go far."
bad,"You can be an excellent hard worker and they will reward people that kiss up and do very little work. They will get better pay and rewards. Run.Dont walk away from this company. Wrong people are promoted."
bad,"If you happen to be a woman, you will be harassed by customers, and management will do the absolute minimum to support you.  Stores also operate on lean staffing, which makes everyone - staff and customers- unhappy.  Cashiers must stand on hard concrete floors, and management will want you to double as theft deterrents by making you stand in the way of possibly violent thieves."
bad,do not like Corp model all profit to meet investors expectations don’t take care of employees. No regular schedule as to accommodate people have responsibilities beyond the job no advancement
bad,I loved working at Home Depot work environment was good and quickly grasped my responsibilities! They trained me in two departments . Being from a First Nation family and working on native land and helping native customers was my dream come true . Until I had hurt myself on the job which led to a hernia mesh failure. I continued to work and give them my best . Assistant manager was wonderful and said I could not have medical leave but would hire me back without resume in April 2019.i put in my resignation in August 2018 to go have surgery and heal .  Unfortunately He was transferred when I was ok by surgeon to go back to work .Being a graduate from Woman in trades and having experience I felt qualified to continue to give my best again . My deep disappointment was when I learned they did not report my injury as I had trusted . Because of inside problems with management . I did everything I could to get back to working April 2019. Head office even phoned me for interview and I was to go to local Home Depot for second interview . When they seen me they changed and treated me less than kind . I was told by HR they couldn’t give me a formal interview . After chatting I was told I would get a call in two days . The next morning I was sent an email stating I was not qualified . This unfortunate unfair situation  is not right . I had planned to make a career for working for Home Depot . I have now let Woman in trades program aware of how they treat trained up woman who work in the construction sector . Very disappointed in how I was treated . I still have every two days a match in
bad,"Unfortunately I'm still stuck working for this company but am leaving very soon. The managers are completely horrendous. They will micro-manage you, blame you, threaten your job on a daily basis, and basically make it an ""un-workable"" environment. "
bad,"The company wants you to invest way more of yourself into it than it will into you. You’ll spend months, maybe even years there just to get cheated out of pay, deal with way more bashing of what you do wrong rather than what you do right. Everyone thinks they’re your boss and the management never seems to be on the same page. At one point I thought it was a great place to work until I really opened up my eyes and saw what was really going on. Don’t waste your time nor energy."
bad,The managment they get in seems like they dont know whats going on and try screw you every chance you get. Dont trust anybody there. Manegment will step all over you
bad,"apart from my store manager and two or more of other department management this store 0816 was awful to work with. Constantly short staffed, constantly critiqued on my job by cashiers who would run and complain or threaten to quiet, because their breaks wasn't right on time, or they didn't get to clock out exactly at closing; first this is supposed to be customer first company so as long as there is a customer or a few customers in the store we can't just leave. Then my supervisor had inconsistent direction/supervision, my supervisor was rarely on the floor and when issues arose I felt I was handled and not the problem.Good example if I'm short cashiers I need drinks and trash done I need to ask the cart pushers. Well most of the time you can't find them or they won't respond or they just simply don't do it. I shown proof to my supervisor of them on their phones in the cart corral or standing out their talking; nothing was done. on top of that my supervisor told the cart pusher their job was the lot first and if they can get to the drinks then to do it, this changed one cart pushers perspective entirely now he just doesn't do it. No cross training and when I suggested it I was told there was no time to do so."
bad,Here’s my review for this store as I worked here in the freight department. I wish I never applied at the Home Depot. Training was forgotten about after orientation and managers treat you like they don’t care if you ever come back. I put in 110% every night I worked just to have others barely put in 50% then was told I had no right to be mad about this. You’ll have no voice here much less be apart of a team they promote. I was fired for standing up to people that treated me and others poorly. HR department isn’t there for you as I was toyed with after speaking up and then fired by another manager/HR representative. It’s affected other opportunities I’ve had after leaving. DON’T WORK HERE!
bad,"I wish I never applied. However, the only thing I gained was being a Merchandiser experience and yet that was didn't always go as smoothly.  Venders on occasion, when it was a huge project or even a small project, would not send all the parts for a project."
bad,"The Joliet DC picks unprepared, lazy and hostile management as their people and they do not have the willingness to fire or transfer bad management. This causes good management to leave and it is rinse and repeat."
bad,"They have to take care of the workers and review the salaries. "
bad,"At first it was a fun place to work.,  Over the years, going to work became difficult. I twas really management.  They really didn't train people they made supervisors how to be supervisors..  They really promoted based on who you were friends with or if someone liked you.  They didn't look at your ability or knowledge of the job."
bad,Do not work at the home depot.  They are always understaffed and you will end up doing the job of 3 to 4 people.  They only care about one thing and that is sales.  I worked there 6 years and the last few years were a joke.  Over worked and under paid!
bad,"When they do interviews for positions (in house) they have already decided who they are putting into place. The interviews are for show only. It's not about the quality of work you do, it's a popularity contest basically. "
bad,"Working there makes me depressed. Just the thought of going there the next day makes me miserable and depressed.The management sucks. I've tried switching to 4 different departments and every single time they gave me the same excuse ""oh it's a full time position"" or ""we don't have open slots"" within a month the same exact position was taken by someone who didn't even work at home Depot. Also management is up your behind for every tiny thing"
bad,"stressful, busiest department in the store. Not enough coverage, poor management. Too much partisanship. learned how to enhance management qualities that were already there"
bad,Treated workers unfairly. Just not a great place to work and also very sexist. The pay was 10.50 hourly not enough to feed your family full time and the work was slavery.
bad,They rarely authorize overtime. Skeleton crew. Bad employees got all the rewards and attention. The store owner had no idea what he was doing. Bled for this company over the summer doing 50-60 hour weeks and rarely got a thank you. Tons of toxic employees. Good/hardworking employees left.
bad,"I worked there for five months and more hours were always tight and the overall moral was constantly low, I ended up leaving because my hours got cut down to four hours a week"
bad,"no comment. Im sorry i have no comment. It is a typical retail store. Very big on cost cutting, small five cent yearly reviews. skeleton staff, and every manager has a different objective."
bad,"Policy. Each employee must be able to lift 50#. However, 95% of the employees at St Augustine HD don't but expect another associate too. And even carry their workload too. Ofa n lumber n garden n receiving do the work. Everyone else just about has their hands in their pockets looking to avoid customers. And management wearing slippers in a retail construction type warehouse? I suggested some excellent ideas to help improve like in the PR dept. But associates again bucked the idea for better organization for quicker products retrieval n cleanliness. Buy store mgr said, that means changing the culture. Yes that's correct. However, still a socialist mentality working environment."
bad,You get your schedule and you clock in and out and sign in to the system.  You work with customers until you get a break which were given when they got around to it.  I learned something new and management was okay and the workplace culture was okay.  The hardest part of the job was getting there and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.
bad,"Find something better to do with your life. "
bad,"the least they could do is provide an ample amount of hours per month for a call-in, 2 hours would never suffice or 4 for full-time workers. They need a better system for discounts as well."
bad,"Management was extremely poor and was never helpful in resolving issues with customers, work atmosphere was poor and often felt like middle school, work safety fell by the wayside, benefits and PTO/Vacation were subpar, and a lot of corners were cut by other supervisors and managers"
bad,"As a Department Supervisor you are required to preform all the sales associate duties as well as supervisor duties and whatever special tasks the managers are “asking” of you all while being the only one in the department for most of the day. You MUST complete your whole chore list they give you every day without fail, but you’re not allowed overtime. Managers are obsessed with their bonuses. They are based on the overall performance of the store. If your store is having a difficult time making quota because the foot traffic isn’t there, be prepared to see the managers outright lie about employees to be rid of higher paid associates. You’re REQUIRED during every review period to have a certain number of employees listed as “improvement needed” regardless of whether or not there are deserving associates. This is a failing grade and indicates they are close to termination. The stores are notoriously understaffed. The managers will publicly tout how they take care of their own injured at work, then in meeting rooms gripe about the people on the payroll and express their disgust for those people for siphoning money because of legitimate injuries sustained at work. Highly stressful environment. For the few benefits they offer, it’s not worth the effort."
bad,"Home Depot will abuse any work ethic you have.  Coming from a military background I supervised 3 departments in which we were short staffed, people called in sick daily and there was a toxic dynamic between other department supervisors.  Typically I was asked to accomplish an impossible number of tasks daily between covering my employee breaks, inventory, merchandising, and whatever Myapron requirements were required.  Upon advancement you are expected to do a ridiculous amount of useless online testing and training that has nothing to do with your expertise in your department or job and expected to run your department while completing it all (if you work in a high volume store this is utterly impossible).  I averaged over 13 miles on hard concrete floors daily and was paid 14.00/per hour.  I would not go back for 25 an hour."
bad,"Poor management, favoritism, wanna be bosses, managers don’t know how to talk to people, and they are prejudice. Minorities are reprimanded differently than others."
bad,"Hired for full time, turned out to be part time(with full time hours and a lack of benefits). Management would delay giving me my contract several months until hours dropped in the winter to keep me on part time, even though I was working full time."
bad,The Home Depot is one of the stricter employers I have ever worked for. They have way more regulations for employees than other companies. They have very poor management which has a tendency to be hostile to those under them. The only benefit to working at The Home Depot is that the hours aren't too bad.
bad,"It's an OK job if you're a full time student, They are very flexible with hours,  Also they do have benefits for part time and full time employees,always hiring"
bad,"After almost 5 yrs of employment it has been a nightmare at Dickson City. Pa on the MET team.As a former supervisor and certified Horticulurist I have tried to fit in the company to use my experience and knowledge to help the company at what I know best and enjoy as the company promises advancement.  I have witnessed 13 employees qiut during my first 12 months on the MET team at HomeDeot in Dickson City, Pa.. All attempts failed. However, I have experienced poor mangment and a lot of favoritism, yelling and screaming from management at employees. The companies so called values and reality are 2 different things. Managment is disorganized and a disgrace to the workforce who is always to blame for their mismanagent.Not a good place to work if you expect fairness and decency as a human being. Shame on Home Depot for not having a strong HR department in house."
bad,The best thing about Home Depot is their health insurance and that's where it ends. They have the worse managers I've ever seen. Don't bother going to corportate for anything as they are part of the problem (they hire these managers) and don't care. I did like the people I worked with and they are the reason I worked there for as long as I did.
bad,Worst job I ever had racism and favoritism is out of control at the store I was at would not recommend this store to anyone looking for advancement unless you are a miniority
bad,"I worked Part-Time for Home Depot for 5 years. I was a student so they were aware from the beginning that my schedule would change each semester. This was perfectly fine for 4.5 years. I was promoted and had an excellent working relationship with everyone. Management changed and would not work with my school schedule. I went through the proper procedures to change my schedule. I was also accused of taking money. Police were involved and they found the money was stuck in a carrier tube between the deposit area and the safe. Not only did the supervisor not apologize for almost having me arrested, I believe that the embarrassment of the supervisor being wrong led to them not accommodating my schedule for the current semester. I was vocal that there was no way I could work Wednesday nights and they continued to schedule me on Wednesday nights. I was let go because I couldn't come in on Wednesday nights. I was cashier of the year, cashier of the month, promoted to head cashier, had a great relationship with my coworkers and customers, and overall a loyal and dependable employee. Do not work for Home Depot."
bad,"Leadership is incredibly poor at their jobs and are frequently trained by associates who should have been promoted instead. There is no appreciation for the harder working employees while lazy individuals get constant praise. Associates who have demonstrated loyalty by working many years at the warehouse in Westfield, MA are treated like a burden instead of people who should be pushed for promotion. Personal politics play an incredible part in decisions made by management, where those who suck up get preferential treatment. Do not work at the RDC in Westfield, it is a waste of time for any rational thinking person."
bad,By far the most annoying people to work with they love drama and conflict  it's like being in high school all over again basically 50 year olds going on 14 they gotta grow the f*** up
bad,I believe Home Depot is a good company but not exactly at the PC Home Depot 1702. Management sucks and they have favoritisms. Some ASM doesn’t treat employees fairly and equally as others. They are always understaffed and 100 percent of the time you have to go without a break especially as a head Cashier but lunches are guarantees whenever that is too. That’s my experience with this Home Depot particularly 1702 but I know in my heart it’s a good company. Oh and the other thing too is so many fake people in that store. From the HR management to ASM’s.
bad,"A typical work day involved being screamed at by employees who you've never met, then helping a customer that even the managers refused to help. I constantly did everyone else's jobs and I worked 8 hours shifts in the summer heat with no break. Home Depot should honestly be shut down."
bad,Home Depot is a very much if they like you you can go far but if they do not you are not going anywhere. They only promote people who kiss their rear ends.
bad,Depending on your goals and aspirations The Home Depot is a nice place to work.  The pay is low but there is room for advancement if you are ambitious.
bad,Management is horrible! You do a lot of work for less pay. Supervisor in flooring department  is disrespectful and rude. You call a manager for assistance and it takes hours before one shows up.
bad,the home depot in north Conway was is a very bad place to work the managers aren't good everyone back stabs each other just not a fun place to work and the dh on the freight team just yells at people for no reason
bad,"If you do not want or cannot drive the equipment, consider yourself as a low hours employee. One day you get praised next day you may get stabbed in the back by management, HR works more against you than for you , although they make it like they are on your side. Plus HR cannot keep confidentiality, this makes it uncomfortable environment to work. Full timers get most of the benefits not part timers, as it seems ."
bad,Love my job at Home Depot just had some issue. But loved to work there so much that I would take more shifts to help out. And enjoyed my friends that i had meet cause of my job there.
bad,"Started out as a great, fun place to work.  The last 1.5-2 years there, management got very inconsistent in all areas of the operations. Inconsistent schedules, not holding certain people accountable, no empathy, no concern for their employees; only profits."
bad,The hours were less than 8 hrs a week. I kept asking for more hours but I never got them. My supervisor was a young guy who was very bossy and always watched what you were doing.
bad,"Dying retail company which try to look  sucsessfull and transfer all problems on their employees."
bad,"it was a fun job in the spring and summer, i worked in the garden so when july/ august comes thats when they either keep you or let you go. it was a good experience"
bad,This is a company that doesn't value your education nor your skills. They can have you learn each and every single department in a store and still keep you at minimum wage.
bad,They have a pay cap so you can work there a decade and still only make what a new employee is making.  If you dont pay attention to your hours or your schedule you can get screwed on your time you actually worked.
bad,"Their pick of management is horrible. I've been to multiple stores and worked multiple positions at Home Depot. The trash managers are all over the place, in multiple departments and different stores. The weakness of poor managers shreds the morale of any team. Dealing with that on top of your occasional rude customers and being pulled from your department or project multiple times becomes stressful. The pay isn't bad if you're looking for extra ends but just prepared for what you're signing up for."
bad,"I liked the freight team I worked with but we definitely worked beyond our pay grade and the 8 cent raise after a year was pretty insulting, which is when I left"
bad,I’ve been with Home Depot for six years no room for advancement but I still loved working with my crew and helping the customers to find what they are looking for I take pride in my work love the holiday resets
bad,"I would not recommend working at the home depot because they pay minimum wage and ask way too much of you. The management is very bad, with no one wanting to do anything. The store managers would get upset if you needed them for anything. The department managers would hide and expect you to take care of any customer issues. If you did anything wrong they would throw you under the bus and write you up."
bad,This was a great place to work woth highly competitive wages. It is not anymore. The changes to staffing and culture the current CEO has implemented have almost all been for the worse and wages have not kept up with inflation at all.
bad,Working at homedepot was a job in itself. Understanding the process was easy. Getting the job done was sometimes tough but once you got it down you were good to go.
bad,"Home Depot was once a great company to work for, but that was a lifetime ago. Management are sheep and have no clue. Constant petty infighting. People are not promoted based om merit. People are promoted based on how much and how hard you are willing to screw someone over"
bad,"There's nothing fun about having a group of managers who play favorites and only promote the people they like. I'm sure not all home depots operate like this, but the store I worked in sure does. I had to fight for and was only offered full time after I threatened to quit in the middle of annual inventory. they knew they needed me and my worth but they refused to respect me or even consider promoting me. don't waste your time working there unless you are retired and are tired of sitting at home all day and need something to do."
bad,I think it was a ok job but wish it was easy more and I kind like it when I was help the customers out at the cars so if u enjoy doing things like that u will like it
bad,The Home depot was probably the worst job ive had so far. The management did not care much about the employees and did not bother helping most of the time.
bad,"If working for $11/hr and going home physically exhausted every day is your thing, then this is the perfect job for you.  You'll work with a team of men and women but don't count on the women to do very much of the physically-demanding heavy work."
bad,They seemed annoyed by my lack of knowledge almost immediately after starting. No training and I had to apologize to a lot of customers because of it.
bad,"Home Depot Bathroom Remodeling is one of the worst sales positions I have ever had. Turnover is over 95% and getting paid looks like it will take a lawyer. "
bad,At the store I worked at the management was more concerned about percentages and statistics than real life situations. It was explained by the management this allowed them (the management) to receive bonuses and incentives when the rest of the employees were required to work harder because of being short staffed. In fact most of the part time employees wages are below the federal poverty level do to insufficient scheduled hours
bad,"You should avoid this company at all costs. You will not be trained properly. You will not be treated fairly. You will be the scapegoat for other people's laziness. You will be given tasks that deliberately set you up to fail. Management lives in a fairytale world of grandiose expectations without bothering to know how things actually work and burdens associates with wasteful guidelines that hinder productivity. Beware of the infamous ""Aware Line"", basically a tattle tale line anyone can call and say anything about you, each store has at least one person or more that religiously calls this and can take something out of context and then your the one who has to defend yourself, HR  will consider you guilty even before they talk to you. The only redeeming thing is the pay, its somewhat tolerable but if you what a DH position walk away from it if they don't offer you at least $3 more an hour. The only enjoyable thing was making friends with the 20% of the people that  did 80% of the work."
bad,I did not like the management at the Home Depot in Corneliius.  I was constantly bullied by my immediate and supervisor and she was the primary reason why I left once I had a new position.
bad,Working at Home Depot was fun until they started to change a large amount of things. I was the DH for Millwork and than they combined it with Lumber/Building Materials. They felt that i was more than capable to run 3 departments but felt that i wasn't deserving of a decent raise. 46 cents was not sufficient for the amount of work i was doing.  Management also didn't help with the constant beating and they didn't recognize your hard work only your failures. Yet they want to make sure that you recognize the associates for the good things they do.
bad,"This company expects you to cover other departments you are not certified nor qualified for without compensation."
bad,The atmosphere was normal retail atmosphere. It was very nice dealing with customers in the capacity I was given. I worked in appliances when I left and that was great
bad,Working there was ok for awhile but I never expected to work there as long as I did to not get my recognized but unfortunately  working there to witness how the company allowed so much wrong to go on and nothing was being done about it even after speaking with higher management and until unprofessional management occurred throughout the store. It was my que to leave
bad,The management that is there is very unprofessional. There is so much favoritism there as well. Some of the coworkers worked really hard while others did nothing
bad,I don’t feel supported and any past or present associate can contact and make false claims that put your job at jeopardy. It’s by far the most tenuous role I’ve ever been in where I’m salary with years good evaluation/reviews and delivering under pressure going above and beyond my results are marginalized and results are questioned not globally consistent left feeling unappreciated and without job security.
bad,"the lack of promotion"
bad,It was a low-paying job. Working environment Dusty Hot in the summer Due to lack of air conditioning at night. A lot of heavy lifting.Not enough staff overnights. You have to work too hard to finish the Freight.  If you like Working For low pay This is a job for you
bad,"I was offer and accepted an order fulfillment position, they gave the job to someone else who ended up never working there.  Ended up in lot instead.  Took six weeks for the person who does the schedule to understand my availability, consistent scheduled me during my other job which is a set schedule.  Most shifts I'm running all over the place trying to keep up.  The most frustrating part is getting repeat loading calls when I'm helping other customers."
bad,"I have learned a lot about people and not to be like some of my management. Not good leaders and set bad examples. They do not care about their employees like they say. Management makes their employees cry. When I started there, it was a wonderful work environment but has changed extremely."
bad,Home Depot was a good place to work loved it it was a always a hands on job until one day a guy brought in the dog and it came up to me and bite me on the leg.
bad,"Super Racist company i ever worked for in canada...its actually not a company but managers..Racism at peek at Saanich location..Go and see yourself who are Asst Managers and all supervisors. Avoid working at this particular location unless you are good at licking and doesn't really care for career advancement. I personally have wasted a year here thinking one day they will recognize my hard work and I will get my prize. Work at gas station or any fast food location if you really need work."
bad,"People been there 3 years, making $11 an hour. Other people just started, been there 3 days, making $11.50 an hour. Pay is not fair. Home Depot needs to unionize! "
bad,"You are expected to annoy people every 2 or 3 days to see if they are ready to start the project that you gave them a quote on."
bad,The manger was having sec with everyone . It was a big high school and not a good fit.  They played with hours and had their favorite  I hate the company only good thing was the get together I like that
bad,"They trained me for Front End Supervisor, put me in special management training course, and then brought in someone from a different department to take over after I had been running the front end for months without a raise. I was pretty disappointed."
bad,"Operations is a disaster. Lack of management support. You'll work hard to open new business then they will take accounts from you. "
bad,The leadership teams do not talk well or work well together not do they talk directly to people they lead. Leading be example was never demonstrated. Leaders felt entitled to lead and did not earn the respect of the people.
bad,"Mangement needs to be trained better,when corporate are investigating dont go to the person friends typical day at work morning meeting were employee sleep through or ate there breakfast,the hardest part of the job is trying to understand who is running the show the supervisor or employee my experience the employees ran the show.enjoyment on the job was meeting new people."
bad,"rules changed, not enough qualified people to work jobs, too many part timers, not enough people to cover departments.managers would not support employees"
bad,"It was an okay job at first, but the management at the store I worked at was horrible. They showed favoritism and the hours sucked unless you dropped everything and did them favors all the time. I was there for over a year and didn't receive my raise. They only did as they were told when they knew corporate was coming for a visit."
bad,"Management is shockingly poor. Bullying and envious mentality from management towards successful salespeople. The company is trying to get away from high performers and flood the territory with a new sales force with modest income expectations so that they won't have to pay within the bonus tier. Decent place to work if you will be satisfied making 50 k with no reimbursement for gas, vehicle, tolls, mileage etc. and tolerating disrespect from leadership with no job security. I would recommend it as a secondary revenue stream to compliment another job if you can make the hours work, otherwise stay away."
bad,"This company has reduced it customer service and training to the lowest common denominator. Employees are no longer valued for skills, abilities, or knowledge. The employees who did know anything or who enjoyed working at the ""old Home Depot"" have long been run off by unsensible policies or fired for bogus reason because they made too much money. If someone knew the business inside and out, was a hardworker with great customer service, and made $20/hr., they would fire them and hire  2 newbies for $8/hr. It is better math for them and the stake holders."
bad,"A typical day at work includes being responsible for your duties as well as picking up the slack from others including the management team.The customers made it fun to come back and help make their ideas come true, but management made it feel like being in high school again. They had favorites and never seemed to solve any issues unless it affected them directly.  The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of maintaining the stock and appearance of your department while being able to help people come up with ideas for painting and staining different projects."
bad,"I was a freight associate at store #3024. I had to quit because my store manager wouldn't work on my hours because I started school. No career advancement. If you're lucky you'll receive a 10 cent raise after a year of employment. Horrible graveyard hours with no way to switch. Have a very strict call out policy.Terrible management that had no respect for their associates, literally treated us like slaves, played huge favorites and would expect more out of certain associates compared to others. A cashier makes the same amount as a freight associate while the workload is no where near the same. I would never recommend anyone to work for this company, they will use and abuse your work ethic. My supervisor was a heavy meth head whom got fired from one home depot and rehired at another. My store was #3024"
bad,they are full of nonsense. they lack proper management and they employees at risk all the time. Equipment are upgraded for safety.
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this employer, there are many things wrong with their business model and the way employees are treated and overlooked constantly by management."
bad,"Unless you are a favorite of management, you're going no where in this store. They made it seem like such a wonderful place to work at, but failed to follow through. Never had coverage for training. Inconsistent scheduling. Not as great as the make it sound. Empty promises of full time, even if you worked your tail bone off."
bad,Was a very cut throat job in the sense it felt as if I was thrown on the floor just to fail.I had called off twice in one week due to throwing up and feeling nauseas on consecutive days to only end up being fired after that for “poor attendance”.At the end it was hard to learn when all you had was a computer teaching you everything else but the hands on work.
bad,"Not only was the workplace culture terrible, the management was even worse.  A typical work day was very stressful, not because of the work but because of the management."
bad,Its a mess there. Unorganized. Lack of communication skills. Grity and hostile work environment.  No room for advancement. Co-workers are great management sucks and are poorly trained.
bad,"This company demands a lot from you but it depends on who you are. "
bad,"Did not like the management, the hours and the environment. The hours were horrible and the people there were mean and rude. The staff was okay but the management team where horrible. Especially the person who is in charge of the cashiers."
bad,"Could be a great place to work if Management was better. Place is fun to work, especially if you like to talk to customers. But, this job you get zero feed back for your work.Not a place anyone should consider working.Do not recommend working here"
bad,"We all live and learn."
bad,The Waltham Home Depot has very bad management skills and they acknowledge people that don’t even do their job. There is no one ever in there departments
bad,Lazy workers and a company culture where you are constantly told to get a home depot credit card and buy home depot stock.  Nothing gets fixed in the store either
bad,"Good place for work, fast pace, meet lots of people,I did like working in there, I don't have much to say for now, The emplyees are from allover the world, so I had the change to show off my bilingual skills"
bad,"When I started, it was a wonderful place to work at! Lots of hrs, never slowed down but only through some winter months! All 4 previous managers that were there when I started, were courteous, respectful, and worked with associates! Once the recent new 4 managers came into place, the working environment went to nothing They started privileging their favorites, and ignoring the true hard workers! Started giving out bad  hrs, and claiming that it was slow! Just no advancements, no awards, no recognition but, complaints about the craziest, bad excuses! All 4 new managers are disrespectful, liars, and unprofessional, that it disgust me to continue to work!!"
bad,Very unhealthy work environment  management will tell you one thing and then change their mind schedule changes are terrible supposed to have a set schedule but that gets changed and you were not notified then you get in trouble for not following your correct shift make sure to take a picture of your schedule managers are very demanding rude to most staff unless your in there click I kno of two people who were promised jobs and we  congratulated on getting them after interviewing for a position and a few days later the store manager changed his mind and gave it to someone else and those people are currently looking for a transfer to a different location
bad,"Poor pay, broken store/IT systems, old school scientific management culture with little respect for employees. Desperately clutching to old ways of business while online/tech savvy corps (such as build.com) steal their large customers and contractors with impunity."
bad,"Do not recommend this company if you are not ready to submit to corporate greed and the loss of your self-esteem.    Work place  culture is immature and cliquish.  Management have no backbone and do not support ""Home Depot"" stated company values .  Work place gossip tolerated.   Customers are allowed to verbally abuse associates to the point of feeling personally attacked and threatened of personal violence.   This behavior is tolerated by store management.   Management uses intimidation and subterfuge to keep staff in line.   Management has referred to the ""cashier associates"" as ""bottom feeders"". There is annual  Associate profit sharing, but store management receive large annual bonuses."
bad,The Home Depot was constantly understaffed while I was working there. This made it incredibly difficult to do your job because bad coverage in other departments will mean that your responsibilities increase. The management rarely found solutions for these consistent problems and would fail to schedule enough workers per department despite having the hours allocated for each department. The most enjoyable part of the day was when I went home at night. The customer is always most important according to the company slogan but most workers fail to understand this concept. If something doesn't directly deal with a department that an employee is in they consider it not their problem. Management does not give you the resources you need to be able to synchronize multiple departments to satisfy larger customer or contractor orders. Inventory is constantly wrong at the stores and often product is sold at one store but fulfilled from another location; usually without one store calling another to ensure that they do have the product that the customer is traveling to retrieve.
bad,Well we're to start let's see all and all this place is a joke. There Managers are a bunch of idiots they will work you like a rented mule . You have a chance for advancement but you will not be paid for it.
bad,They are always hiring for a reason with only 6 positions.  Someone was fired my first day.  Another was fired by the end of my first week.  i was 1 of 6 in the position.  I knew right away I had made a mistake.
bad,"Heavy lifting, over bearing supervisor, and lazy co-workers that only gave instruction if you did something wrong."
bad,"Worked there for a brief time and realized very quickly why the turn over rate of empolyees is so high."
bad,I had worked there for only a few days in lawn and garden before they had completely had me on my own. I was not comfortable with this. I told management and they did nothing. I had no prior retail experience and there was hardly any training. My coworkers were rude and very unsupportive to me being new. They offered little help when I asked for it. Most of my coworkers were men (not an issue) but a few of them made frequent jokes towards me being a woman which made me incredibly uncomfortable. I finally quit when I was cut down to 6 hours a week. I only worked there for two months.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of providing excellent customer service to customers in my departments which was flooring and decor. I operated a reach truck,forklift,electric ladder and pacer unit on a daily basis,moving around carpet rolls, pallets of tile, concrete, paint and loading customers vehicles with their purchases. I learned how to tile floors and bathroom walls and the correct procedures, tools and materials to utilize. The workplace culture could have been better it always seemed as if all the other employees were in a bad mood. The hardest part of the job was coming to terms with why everyone was so unhappy working there which turned out to be poor scheduling and inadequate raise ratio. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing customer service to people when they needed it."
bad,They push selling credit too much and it ruined the job for me. Will never refer someone to this job. It was an awful place to work. And its even worse if you have no knowledge of the products they sell
bad,"They prefer part time employees over full time employees"
bad,This place was motivational to finish college and move on! I've never seen so much fraternizing before in any place I've worked.  It is throughout the company not just the location I worked at.   I worked very hard for promotion but kept on getting pushed back to new hires that were putting out!!
bad,"Several processes and policies are illogical and inefficient. Management at my particular location was the embodiment of this, as well as close-mindedness. Some of them had it out for people who were extremely hard workers, brought the store a lot of revenue, and were extremely flexible and knowledgeable department-wise, simply on the grounds that they offered a better solution, or just an idea that conflicted with theirs."
bad,Days are chill and I good place to start.  but I wouldn't recommend graveyard. Freight is over worked and not appreciated at all. Negative environment.
bad,"The Home Depot is so focused on money and profit they forget to really care about the well being of the people who work there. Building atmosphere , climate is awful, always too hot in most areas of store and dirty. Management is kept under  the  gun for making plan and what is a major feature to getting new associates the  success sharing program is a joke. If you are in a profitable store, the plan is jacked up so high as to be Impossible to attain. Management is too focused on their on advancement and will use anyone as a stepping stone or as an escape goat."
bad,When i was hired i was told they would work with visitation scedule for my children did not happen. They claim thyre all about customer service but writes their employees up for helping customers load their vehicles when no management loading assistance or supervisors would respond to the call for assistance. I like my job and my customers and co workers. But management needs some serious retraining!!!
bad,"I worked at the Berlin Home Depot as a cashier for 1 year and 11 months. I got one raise the entire time I was there... that raise was less than a dollar. Every 6 months, I had a ""review"" an the Front End Supervisor would always make up BS and tell me I was medicore, despite the fact that I always went above and beyond. I always showed enthusiasm, but that definitely ran out once I realized I was being royal taken advantage of. I have a bachelors degree and always showed interest in other departments, but I was never allowed to advance. If I was so bad I was deemed unworthy of a raise every six months, they should have fired me. Also, the Front End Supervisor was changing just about every 6 months/ 1 year. There was no consistency or leadership. "
bad,"was good until they pushed metrics and only used metrics they wanted to get rid of older, more knowledgeable employees. They only care about numbers, employees are only pawns to get management bonuses and trips- employees get no incentives but are treated like they are on commission. Health benefits are very expensive- plan on spending half your check for insurance."
bad,"Overnight shift was terrible, coworkers were terrible, management was terrible. Pay was terrible.  Cant grow, not a career base job. Nothing was good."
bad,It is a retail company that used to be great. Then it went corporate and lost the heart of the company. It is hard work and not much appreciation from management.
bad,"They cut you're hours and give everyone else hours. They lie through their teeth. Yes the benefits are good, but the hours and pay sucks. No asociate discount."
bad,Not a job for people who want to move up in the world it's more for high school kids and older adults last job before retirement it's really OK but not for ambitious goals of not worrying about bills if you have kids
bad,"Sales Consultants work on 100% commission with no reimbursement for gas or vehicle expenses (drive 100-150 miles per day), Poor quality and unqualified leads, financial penalties for job changes, cancellations, etc.  The Sales Consultant is held financially accountable for everything and Home Depot never loses.  You'll be expected to work 6-7 days per week, no paid time off, no vacations, no holidays.  If you don't have an appointment, you'll be expected to go to a store to generate leads--on your own time.  They don't pay any compensation for any time spent in the stores.  Frankly, Home Depot is abusing the definition of the Outside Sales Representative classification in the FLSA.  The installations are generally very poor and many customers are unhappy- it depends on the sub-contractor they assign to the job.  Some are just terrible.  The prices HD charges are very expensive and are not competitive in most markets .Customers are aware and avoiding the brand knowing they can get a dozen other quotes by reputable contractors are far less than HD.  HD is management top-heavy with multiple layers of management and overhead that does nothing to contribute to the sales effort- only inflate the prices to feed the beast.  If a minimum wage jod is what you're looking for- this is perfect.  Sometime you'll earn even less.  Generally, this job is not worth the time and effort involved."
bad,"All in all, I spent seven years employed by The Home Depot, five of them after a self-financed move across the company.  I am unable to speak about the atmosphere in the stores because I worked at both a call center and independently on the road for the Flooring Department.  I put a lot into this job and didn't get much out of it."
bad,"Not a good company to work for,  work and life balance is a major weakness with this company, local Home Depot's exterior branch in wheat Ridge Colorado has gone through 12 branch managers in 10 years and 13 installation service managers in two years"
bad,I had been with the company for 7 years and 2 stores.  from entry level to management.  At its inception Home Depot had values that pleased the worker and the customer.  That is now long in the past.
bad,They are mainly looking for part time employees.   You have to stand on cement floors which is hard on a persons feet and legs. No sitting down expect for lunch.
bad,"Very little pay I am 50 and worked very hard and the other people are like 20 to 30 and do very little and move up fast and play on there phone lost plus they do not know how to do proper management work their ."
bad,Had a problem with a racist boss and asked for the papers where i complained and my store manager supposedly sent to corporate and he told me he had nothing and that i never did
bad,"If you are good at what you do, don't expect to move up. Managers contradict each other so no matter what you do it's never good enough. They will praise you for saving their butts, but when it comes time for your review they change their tune about you."
bad,Home Depot is very hard work lots of lifting. Store 2742 was very racially charged. Management there is lazy and do not want to confront any issues until there is trouble.
bad,"Was hired as a seasonal temp in receiving. The 2 people that already worked in that department acted like I was always in the way. The dept. head said she could get more done if I was not there.Little to no training due to lack of effort from management and employees in the department. Found myself standing around most times. After 2 months they eliminated my job and was told I would not be able to draw unemployment from the operations mgr. Still applied anyway and got it. What a bunch of clicky,self-centered,self serving,rude and inconsiderate people. Good riddance!!  Will never have anything nice to say about the place."
bad,home depot was the worst place ever to work. the were unorganized and never had anything in order. they would mess up yours hours managers was rude to employees
bad,Hours are based on seasonal business needs. There is no opportunity for advancement and raise's. Unpredictable work schedule and hours.
bad,"Not comfortable environment, management doesn't take concerns with there employees seriously. Coworkers/coach's  in your department are rude, they only care about themselves and purposely being unhelpful when you have questions."
bad,Apresiacion y promociones solo atraves de nepotismo oculto que existe en las tiendas de El Paso Texas 79912.
bad,Terrible place especially in Vallejo! Fire employees all the time thats why theres always an opening . HR is terrible that does not help. And stuck up management with no help when comes to customers needs and complaints.
bad,"I liked talking to the customers and ringing up their items...I loved working in the Garden Dept. and watering the plants.  The diversity in the store was very good with alot of different cultures.  The managers are rude and disorganized and also have alot of favortism. Some employees did not do very much and got away with just walking around.  Did not promote people for working hard.  Dropped hours because the CEO said if Obama was elected, he wanted to cut hours so the workers could get food stamps and medicaid.  And it did happen so I was really relieved when I got a better job..Also the head cashiers and supervisor treat you with disrespect."
bad,"This job can be hazardous to one's mental and physical health.  Micromanagement overlooks policies and procedures which need to be updated every year.  There is choosing of favorites, no work standards set forth in writing.   No books on policies or procedures, no onsite HR.   I would recommend this job to my ex."
bad,This is a horrible place to work.  The management is so concerned with customer service that they allow the customers to walk all over the employees.
bad,"Worst place to work, will not give you any requested days off no matter the reason.  Requested days off are rejected every Monday morning"
bad,"A terribly inflexible place to work where there is no thinking outside the box.  Management is completely ineffective, hence the 90% turn over rate for their staff."
bad,This company has great ideas but horrible values. Treats people as if the are disposable and could careless about families. Awful work schedule
bad,"Bad management, co-workers make it hard to get along with. I didn't learn a lot other than being a cashier. Got pushed around and felt used."
bad,"lead associate in Tools, hardware, and Seasonal Departments. Providing customer service, support to other associates and management. packing out merchandise, building displays and other related duties."
bad,"Too much bias in management especially divided among race, particular to the store I was at. Operations manager showed favoritism toward Hispanic associates and rarely to others. Along with talking down to everyone and assuming you know nothing rather than asking if you do. Overall more interested in the bonus they get at the end of the fiscal year than that of safety. Their policy is to report all injuries, yet if you do, it jeopardizes managements bonus and they treat you as if you were stealing directly from them. On the positive side, Human Resources was very nice and worked with me especially around scheduling."
bad,"Working here for three years was not my intention.  I started with the intention to find a career else where but then had to explore more options so I turned to Home Depot and with a Degree and my resume went to management and see where I could go from just being a associate.  The pay sucks, hours are always changing and your treated as if your an expert in the trade you are working.  Again the pay and expectations do not balance out so while upper management gets paid well lower associates hardly make $10 an hour.  Now that I kissed enough a-- and annoyed enough people they finally give me a shot at a supervisor position that is WAY under paid and with no increase significant to live on my own but yet they act like this job is so difficult and complex, please anyone can do this.  Unless your looking for a job to pay for gas and go out to lunch twice a week I suggest you look else where, don't waste your time."
bad,They work you like a dog and are shady with the break the store is dirty rats they put you outside when its 105 outside and you have to wait from some to let you go to the bathroom
bad,"....and it has been awful! If you like to be micro-managed and told what to do, by what may be some of the stupidest managers on the face of this planet, than this is the job for you!! I hated working here. My managers were so unpleasant and rude. I have nothing nice to say! Now I have made my way through college and I am off to far better jobs. I feel so sorry most of the people who have to continue to work here because a lot of the associates are just plain miserable! I would like to clarify that my vailid issues with this job are not the customers, or the associates, but the idiotic management. If I can stop one person from working in this dismal establishment, I know all my suffering will not go in vein :p. The job itself is really easy, but it is really hard to put up with stupidity!!!"
bad,"I worked for the company 6 years. You see too much in 7 years. In the San Fernando Valley, there is a lot of families intertwined in the company. They hire within their families and promote the same way. They do not promote people that work hard and are intelligent. They promote people that they can mold into someone they can control. They are messing with numbers and the LP is involved. I hope that it is just a district thing. Recently, they are firing anyone that has been within the company for years. So, they do hire a lot of new people. They fire people easily and they make the workplace a harsh environment for someones that has a brain of their own. It really is not about customer service in a workplace like this. However, it is a great job for during school other than the added stress. If you are not planning on going to school than work here and make the management happy(coffee) and you can make lots of money as a manager someday, no intellect needed!!"
bad,A typical work day (as a contractor) includes you getting to work and frantically searching for a free computer because they over schedule and hire too many people that there are not enough PC's for everyone. then the second you log in and go available you begin getting hit with calls. This company has the most outages and systems being down then any other one I know. just about everyday there were some kind of outage and no way for us to fix it right then and there. The store employees don't know how to do their job because they are poorly trained. The level 2s that level 1s escalate to are helpful 5% of the time when they choose to actually respond in the chat. The associates hang with associates and contractors with contractors. Pretty cliquey. Management is useless. the hardest part of the job is mentally preparing yourself for the day so you don't slip up and cuss out the caller for being entirely incompetent but has the audacity to be rude and snide.
bad,"it was a hassle"
bad,"Expected more from a bg company like ""the home depot"". Management only takes care of management. They say its an ""open-Door"" Policy but its not. Nothing gets done to help the regular employee with problems."
bad,"The job is boring and tedious."
bad,"Typical day in receiving: make sure all online orders were correctly received, detailed and staged. Unload the stock truck using the slip, reach or sit down forklift. Bring freight from receiving to proper staging areas on store floor. During this six hour shift, at least three other deliveries will come in from other shipping companies with product that also must be unloaded with heavy equipment. (There is also ups, Fed-ex and DHL as well) Job must be done quickly, safely, and with zero breakage. If there is down time I will use the cardboard baler and make a bale, organize room in overhead bays to make space for new product, and put away special orders in their proper bays: doors in door bay, windows in window bay, etc. Often we are shorthanded outside and it is my job as receiver to unload with the sit down forklift the outdoor trucks (concrete, lumber, rebar, etc)"
bad,"IF you let them, they will own you body and soul. No work life balance., Managers are scheduled to work 11 hours a day. Not enough employees on floor to help those that need help. No management in place, you are always on the firing line."
bad,company pushes to get everyone to sign up for there credit card and doesnt appreciate associates going above and beyond to help other customers and associates management lacks the drive to make the store better
bad,Great place to work for! management has been good to me and i feel very blissed to be with this company for as long as i have been.
bad,"Deadlines are not based on how long the work will take. "
bad,New Sales Associates who make sales are always denied proper success shares proceeds. The insurance package is not worth the time spent to obtain it. Management is too interested in saving a dollar by cutting employee hours. Most enjoyable part of this job is interacting with customers. Tough part of job is going behind coworkers and correcting their mistakes as well as taking care of someone else's customer when said associate should have done so because they are obligated to know many departments when you have worked there for many years and know not a thing other than that first department experience.
bad,"They could ask you to work at any department any time and any how. they even send some people shovel the snow around the store during the winter."
bad,"I personal loved my fellow employees. But when things got bad at my store instead of trying to fix our big problems with management, the managers fired 22 people in total I was included in that bunch. ""cleared house""."
bad,"if you work at customer service they will ask you to do everything in the store, returns wil call online orders calls and you will realize your pay does cover anything your doing....other company's strart customer services reps off at least $15 a hour....if you work an 8 hour day you will process at least $10000 in sales."
bad,"Typical day"
bad,"During my time at The Home Depot I was continually awarded for my hard work and great customer service. However, it was an unpleasant culture of threats and intimidation. Most had nothing to do with ones performance, but with silly issues, like where to park, staying late with needy customers, thus incurring O/Time which you were not allowed to take as time off in lieu, but were forced to take 5hr lunch breaks etc."
bad,"Home Depot is a horrible company to work.  They claim to care about the associates, but they don't. It was not that way years ago, it has just progressively gotten worse over the years. No job is safe. Once they decide they don't need you anymore, they will find  a way to get rid of you. They first try to make work conditions unbearable to try to get you to quit.  When that doesn't work, they write you up for mundane  reasons. After giving them over 25 years of service (off & on) I was tossed out like yesterday's garbage."
bad,"I have so much bad to say, that I would rather not respond,."
bad,"Home Depot has great benefits for their associate. A typical work day is dealing with customers, assisting them with issues and orders. There is nothing that really hard about working at The Home Depot."
bad,"this was promised to be a management training program - they have sense closed the program and for good reason.  It was unstructured and after 2 years you were thrown into a store unprepared and set up for failure.  "
bad,"A retired Engineer, I was looking to occupy some of my time with activity that would be socially satisfying. Applied for parking lot attendant (shopping cart acquisition). After reviewing my resume, my interviewer told me that I would be best suited for Tool & Hardware Sales Associate. They meant well, but when I tried to give them the benefit of 45 years of ""Continuing Improvement"", I was told on no uncertain terms to just put in my time. That is not a job description; that's a prison sentence. After 89 days I was informed that there were too many discrepancies in my schedule (1 day for a dental appointment and 1 day for injury recuperation, not on the job)."
bad,"I worked at the Service Desk, where we were almost always shorthanded. Management refused to address the need of a critical aspect of the store and demanded the absolute most from its underpaid & overworked employees. "
bad,"I liked the job, but it soon became apparent to me that there was a lot of gossip , lies and back stabbing going on. People were trying to get others fired for reasons I am still unclear about, other then their own insecurities and laziness, especially the women. It was sickening and one of the main reasons I left them even after offered a raise and promotion."
bad,Great coworkers and environment at Home Depot but management and training is horrible.  I've had many jobs throughout my life and never was in a position where training was so unorganized but yet you were still expected to know things you never were properly trained in.  Very unscheduled and not a comfortable work environment due to the micromanagement of some managers.
bad,"Stocking product and helping customers."
bad,Do not work for Home Depot Corporate.  Worse job I ever had.  Poor culture
bad,"Worked there for five years and experienced the attitudes of four different store managers. All of which, enforced different rules and regulations. Last two were not fair with the treatment of employees."
bad,"Working at the homedepo in Keller was messy. My boss wasn't to friendly she never smiled and made rude comments, she gossips with other employees. I had to file for harassment and my store manger never took it to HR so I had to call HR and get it taken care of. They don't care for their employees at all."
bad,Home Depot expect a computer to do all of the training and if you ask management for additional training they will do nothing!!!!!
bad,"Nothing about this company is good, Nothing was good, bad management,  horrible work schedule. Just not a good work environment."
bad,I never worked in a place with such unprofessional managers/supervisors in my life. You are treated like your a 1st grader. Most of managers at the Watertown location are the  miserable people I have ever met and are not happy unless they make you miserable along side them
bad,Never work here they want too much for too little... I will never work for them again I worked yhere for five years and only got 2 dollars over five years
bad,hours are horrible they want you to get everything done and then they saw no overtime. They want customer service but if its wrong you are held accountable.
bad,"Work hard for little pay and no appraisal, get yelled at for not meeting sales(customers not purchasing items). Suggested employees -Teenagers."
bad,"No promotions no longevity no career opportunity, now not a good company to work for. no  consideration for the ill."
bad,"A typical day at this store is to walk up to the cash register area and find out that you'll be working short because someone else had just quit and out got let go. So you work short handed and you assist the customers any way that you can by pointing them in the direction of the item there looking for. When they come back up you ask if they found it okay and if they have anymore question, at that point you check them out and bag up there items. "
bad,"Basically you are given schedules that change daily and vary as to what shift you are working. Customer service is priority but managers will give you tasks that must be done before lunches and breaks, these tasks usually are four to five hours long in duration. "
bad,The Home Depot is a joke. they make millions have billions in assests but they treat their employees at least at the store level like second class citizens  the pay scale is so skewed its ridiculous. The dept Supervisors make less than their associates and have an incredible amount of pressure and responsibility. The environment of the store management is do it even if its wrong or unsafe and we will fix it if it gets caught. I know its Home Depots right to make as much money as they can but not at the expense of the employees. I have been a manager since I was 19 and I have never seen it as bad as store 469 in mesa az.
bad,"I highly recommend that you run the other way if The Home Depot calls you for an interview. This company lives in the dark ages when it comes to managing performance of the hourly associates. It's a constant and consistent game of political correctness at each store. The store that I worked at allowed an associate to defraud the company with worker's compensation, allowed a male to sexually harass several women in the store, and allowed multiple associates to take unauthorized discounts for customers when they knew they had no privilege. Basically, the store asked me to manage the associate by fear and not hold them accountable for fear of lawsuits. If you find out that any of your direct supervisors have worked for Lowe's, you need to quit or transfer immediately. It is a guarantee that you may not survive. And if you find out that any of this sort of behavior is going on at your store and you report it, you will suffer consequences.  Poor management, leadership, and CYA by management is the one thing that you can count on. If you have a passion for people, training and developing, and ambition to advance with a company, The Home Depot is not for you."
bad,If you enjoy working for a zoo then this is the place to work. Your employees never show up on time if they decide to come in. You get stuck working 15hr shifts with no appreciation from your superiors. The only good thing about this company is the additional experience you receive as a supervisor.
bad,"The Home Depot is a good starter job. That's the only positive that I can ever say in my three and a half years. In that time it has been a stressful situation from day one. Management is incompetent to the point where it almost becomes a comedy skit with them. The employees (such as myself) are underpaid and have to learn to multitask to the point of insanity.We deal with about a hundred customers a day most of them rude, obnoxious, and we get no support from management or supervisors on anything.The only time that they ever show any sort of real leadership is when they are trying to save the store money for their own bonuses. You can be the hardest worker in the company and show much more intelligence than the people running it and still be passed over simply because you aren't sucking up."
bad,"The most enjoyable part about my job at the Home Depot was a combo of gaining the knowledge of the department and assisting customers. I learned about power tools, generators, nuts, bolts, nails, screws, etc. "
bad,"Mixed paint, customer service etc. stocking the shelves.helping with customer service."
bad,"Worked at Home depot for about a year. After I took it upon my self to start working overnights i was brought into the office and basically told i have to switch to a department where i was very unqualified or lose my job. "
bad,"Do not waste your time working for this company.  Poorly managed.  If you are not one of their favorites, you are done.  The pay rate is poor."
bad,"For a large company these folks had constant changing procedures based on what the Management wanted that week. You were constantly threatened to ""Just do it or be terminated"". They constantly lied about our job security and after preaching ""No one will lose there jobs, only your position may change a little"",then they called us all in and told us our positions are all being terminated. They did create a few new positions they had us apply for that were now salary as we were hourly associates, and we were told we had to be available to work 24 hrs. a day 7 days a week for less pay. Mangers constantly were moving jobs around and placing deficient jobs in your name to protect ""Their favorites"". The only good part of this job was working out in the field on your own satisfying customers who appreciated whatever you could do for them in a very unorganized system !"
bad,"Part time job. Employees are overworked. Supervisors do not care about employees. Some managers had bad attitude... Some were nice. Worst place to work if you are trying to make a living to support your family, pay is really bad...Not happy at all with my experience there."
bad,"Management was a joke, jobs made no sense, pay was insulting, I will never work or shop and any Home Depot again for the rest of my life."
bad,never worked for company that would not let you work.you learn alot in diferent departments management is slack.coworkers are great.hardest part is learning to use different phones and computer classes.going home
bad,its a very bad company to work for the Management is the Biggest problem at home depot and the way they treat the workers of Colors is why the are very bad to work for
bad,This place is full of people who met dead ends and complain all day. Some of the people are very nice and are productive. Others will make it a living hell for you.The management team is horrible. Most of the time you would find yourself knowing more then they do yet they get to keep their jobs. The pay is terrible. For a billion dollar company they sure know how to keep their workers unhappy. The hardest part of this job is seriously trying not to get into an argument with management because they think you are stupid. On another note meeting alot of new people daily is rather interesting.
bad,I enjoy working at homedepot because everyone there are easy to work with.
bad,this was a great company once. its not what it use to be.
bad,"Pay is bad, people are worse. They will harass you and discriminate against you. When you complain to HR they will retaliate and make things worse. Everyone there is the trash thrown out from other businesses. Every professional in Atlanta will tell you of this reputation."
bad,"bad management, there is a big lack of communication and respect towards the gwa, every week there rules change, the gwa's are friendly and welcoming but i cant say the same about the leadership, they have no respect amongst themselves and will put you in the middle of there situation(s), human resource will not adjust any issues that you are having out in the floor, i have to say it is the worst environment i have ever worked in and its not the work its the leadership that make it a hostile place to work, you will lean to use several pieces of equipment, but at there covinience when they are ready to teach you, the coaches are very helpful, the hardest part of the job is the leaderships attitudes but the most enjoyable part is when you leave at the end of your shift just because of the pressure the leadership pounds on you and the headache they cause you"
bad,"nothing to say, was needing a job to pay rent and left when i found a better paying job."
bad,It has the potential to be a great place to work. Nepotism and favoritism does run rampid.
bad,"Typical grave shift was hectic and panic inspired. Managers cutthrought and lacked interpersonal skills. I learned to avoid further jobs of this nature if nothing else, especially the part-time status to avoid giving employees benefits, but strictly regulated consistant 40 hr. work weeks. Best part was the co-workers, hardest part, leaving physically and emotionally unscathed, with a positive constitution at the end of the day."
bad,"The start of every day centers around the time clock. Punching in/out at the exact time is essential as an incorrect punch can result in a a verbal or written warning. Many associates write down their times to make certain they clock in/out on the minute. During training you're told there is a seven minute window, which seems far from true."
bad,I would not trust this company or expect an ounce of job security. I personally know someone that completely dedicated two decades of his life to this company with great success and he was shoved out the door like yesterday's garbage.
bad,"I can only speak for this particular store. I feel this store manager had no regard for the associates and their families. She often would't even show up at her mandatory store meetings at 6 a.m. on a sunday morning. For the most part fellow associates were great to be around. Dealing with the customers at times could be challenging, but for the most part fun."
bad,"From the start I was told a lie from the MEM. I was told by my MEM that he put me into a hostile work environment, but he thought I could handle it. The members of the MET Team were the worst people that I ever had to supervise. They were exteamly disrespectful towards me because there were 2 team members of the team that applied for this possition & I was hired being an outsider. They mad up stoies about me shopping on the clock, within the first 30 days of starting my employment. I was given a final written warning 5 months later, I asked what took them so long, she relpied she didn't have time for me. I reported several times of team members that walked away from me while I was still talking with then\m & giving direction. Nothing was ever done. The management could see this but did nothing to help. I would never recommend anyone to work for the Home Depot. Just hated it. I was terminted for raising my voice at a team member because she was yelling at me, I was trying to tell her to take to the back room, we'll talk about it there. At least I didn't have to go back anymore."
bad,"The best thing about working here is the stability and the and the schedule, off by 3pm."
bad,People who work there are wonderful. Upper management only has eye on bottom line.
bad,it was ok nothing bad to say about goodwill of central i enjoy it the program was great
bad,"i had the worst experience working in home depot. there is no respect for anyone in that company, i dnt reccomend anyone to work there."
bad,Churn and burn.  DM is a micro manager and plays favorites...heavily.  Company dangles a large bonus in front of you but expects you to work a 65 hour work week
bad,"The company is great and was founded on values that take care of people.  However, over the past 5 years that has changed.  Department Supervisors are responsible for 2 to 3 departments and they are scheduled as associates to fill shifts. I understand the restructuring happened after the corporate tax breaks.  All employees were given a raise, but some positions were eliminated.  As a results, employees are now required to work under pressure with lack of employees."
bad,"A typical day at work here was stressful, I felt pressured. I was trained commercially but when it came to dealing with many customers with a hundred questions I was alone at the Customer Service Rep desk. Somewhat or mostly all of the time being a fresh hire. The management was professional but highly demanding. Very fast paced atmosphere. Good compensation. Coworkers could have more Team Spirit."
bad,"1.) Managers and Team Leads/Supervisors don't care about your health, physically or mentally."
bad,I would never recommend HD to friends. they always say they are there for their employees but they look for opportunities to terminate employees with medical conditions.
bad,"La cantidad de cosas por hacer por persona es insostenible, la cultura es buena pero la presión y el estrés siempre van en aumento y no concuerda lo que piden con lo que pagan."
bad,"Manager doesn't care about teaching you about the position you were hired for. You were given a task & you have to complete it with no knowledge how. You're time to finish & when you weren't finished, the manager and the elderly lady would get stressed out. The lady would tell you how to do your job even if you're doing it to the best of your ability, but she will make you want to quit. She would give her opinions and was not nice about it."
bad,I just feel like  dont really care bout there employee..  that why can never keep there employees ..when go to them bout thing they dont listen to what u have say..Plus me working service desk they know wanted move to Appliances they did everything  in power stop going  into appliances but could sell appliances and  they wouldn't let me succeed
bad,At the home depot it appears to be a good job on the surface but that is not the case. The freight team is required to do the job of multiple employees to start the shift dealing with customers in every department while still having to meet quotas for putting away and organizing materials.
bad,This is not a career job it helps pay a few bills a real adult with children  can’t  live off what they were paying at the time not even now! It was nice leaning new things until leaning new things made you  obligated to work and and many areas and not even get paid more you won’t have a real life because they will work you to death and take your kindness for granted!
bad,"Loved the job, but pay was low and hours were inconsistent and all over the place. Management was hard to find. No hope of a set schedule. Laid back atmosphere at times, at others manic. Little training. Very disorganized."
bad,"Corrupt. They express that they are here for their employees but they are not."
bad,"Literally, the pay is underwhelming . The managers don't have a clue as to what they are doing. The scheduling is atrocious and you will find yourself more than likely in a department by yourself at the busiest times. The position advancement or lack there of is ridiculous. I have learned that the people that work hard here are NOT valued at all!! The people who should be fired/disciplined are still working there or worse, have been promoted for doing absolutely nothing! Also, whenever you call for a manager to come help with a customer, they take their sweet time coming to assist. Even the elderly have to wait when it comes to the managers!!! OUTRAGEOUS!!  At the time, if I had known that this is how my work schedule was going to be.. I would have never applied. If you want to work at a place that underpays you(for the amount of trouble, stress, and body aches that you go through), doesn't appreciate you, and leaves you in a department with raging customers, then this is the work environment for you!"
bad,Too much favorite lots of clicks managers suck use u n wipe u out for cheaper n less brains wasted 8yrs there promise you alot n never come though you brown nose or go nowhere not what u know but who you blow
bad,Management has a lot of favoritism. When they say it’s not what you know but who you know it’s so true at the Home Depot! And when you report work place harassment corporate HR won’t do anything about it!
bad,"The work environment the SM and ASM’s provide there is to bully their associates.  They target certain ones and favour others.  They have FORCED several associates to quit due to such a toxic environment.  It’s really a shame because the company itself is an amazing company, but the Duncan location is toxic."
bad,Worked as a Merchandising Specialist. Nothing hard just maintained the store like a cleaning maid. Very Boring. Managers promote their friends and family.
bad,"A lot of time, scheduling will leave me alone without any help. I often get told to ask for help. However, any time I do ask, other associates are often too busy to help or they are unavailable, leaving me to just finish the task myself if it does not require the use of a machine"
bad,I have worked for this company for 5 years and I’m treated horribly by my supervisor and management. The managers are racist and my supervisor is sexist. I feel like a battered wife most days because of the emotional abuse I endure at the hands of my supervisor. It took him 2 years to even speak to me while he chatted up any males in the vicinity. Management has favorites that are a certain race and all others are treated like we are stupid. New hires are paid the same rate coming in that took me 5 years to start earning. Most people here do very little and earn award badges for doing it but I bust my tail in receiving daily without even a thank you. My supervisor finally got me fired after years of trying by setting me up. I was told that an idea I had was great but obviously not since he turned right around and reported me for it. Management could care less that my supervisor made me believe I had done something good because it was my word against his.
bad,"NO COMMENT at this time, please.  Would not recommend working for this company in the local area.  Learned that it is more about who you know.  Integrity is not valued though it is stated as part of the company's mission statement.  You are judged by those you work with and not your actual performance.  SOPs only apply to those who are not in favor.  Otherwise, they look the other way."
bad,"All of the managers are useless and don’t really seem like they know what they’re are doing despite being there for 10+ years. They hardly communicate with each other so it makes it harder on us, the employees. Wouldnt recommend working here for a long time. I have thank Home Depot for aspiring me to go back to school and focus on my education because that is somewhere I do not want to be for a long time"
bad,Management was bad and they would never solve conflicts. Favoritism was shown to employees. They always take the customers side. It’s not with the stress and uncomfortableness.
bad,"home depot isn't a job for the weak minded and fragile souls you have to keep up the pace. customer service was very important. Don't expect the best management in home depot i did not get any training i had to learn as i go and that could make or break the job, they could fire you the same day they hired."
bad,This place suck it’s not a good environment at all . Don’t waste your time . You will be disappointed with the end results . Everyone is childish there and unorganized
bad,Most Customers were rude and sexist. Management was bad. Pay was average for job. Most days were very slow and occasionally  got slammed with no coverage. Managers and supervisors wouldn’t help out. Manager was always rude to me and passive aggressive towards me even though I was good at my job. They don’t increase pay no matter how long you work there. They don’t hire in the company even tho they say they do. Company advocates and funds anti-lgbt agendas.
bad,hot high heat constant movement imposiible to have social life there since thety don't care co workers helpful not fun place to be will never deal with them as customerwas approved for vacation 6 weeks in advance then one month out said no lost job when took vacation they care nothing for you.stressful place to work
bad,Not a good job. Management does not care about you and too stressful for amount of pay. Avoid at all costs. Takes long time to go up and also very biased management
bad,High turnover with no explanations. Lack of in person training. Computer based training for hands on work. Managers don't care for you. They only seem to want male overnight workers to make them do heavier things over 50lbs. They complain to not have hours to give but always hire someone new weekly basis. You'll never know if your doing something wrong or right. No guidance. A lot of diverse people so asking for help from another worker can be difficult because of the language barrier or they don't want to fall behind in their own work. No teamwork. People place ownership on what they Want to do and new people do what everyone doesn't want to do. Managers don't delegate what needs to be done or switch things around. There's no clarity or honesty with this ELLESMERE  LOCATION of HD. They hire and fire. Or people get hired and leave. The people that want to keep their job get let go of. Worst place I've experienced.
bad,It is like you need to be in the management cult. If management does not like you they treat like you were not part of the team. This I found working at the store. My son worked in Atlanta GA and he loved working there and made good wages.
bad,Interviewing process was easy. Most of the fellow cashier associates are wonderful. But sadly that’s the only good thing i can say. Can’t work late on certain days because you have a life outside of work? Well no problem because scheduling is a disaster & others get preference. If you’re skinny & have a cute face you can get away with anything! Besides that no problem! 60% of the items have no sku so how nice of you to drop everything and hold up an already long line of angry customers who will take it out on you! Training is you learn as you go because no one has time to show you. & after a couple of weeks you should already know what to do!
bad,"Working at the Home Depot in Rockford you will find that the associates have no support from management when dealing with abusive customers"
bad,"Worst job I have ever had, upper management heavy. Commission only, use your own car, can’t write off mileage.  Suppose to get your own leads. This role "
bad,No appreciation. The people who work hard and are reliable end up doing everyone else's job while those that stand around and dont complete tasks are ignored. Extremely poor management. Empty promises of advancement. No one is held accountable for actions that are unethical and should be terminated for. Customers are rude and ungrateful. Associates have learned to have attitudes and dont care.
bad,"If you’re looking for a part time  or full time position don’t apply here. The pay is horrible, they start you at $12 an hour when online it says $15 p/hr. Management is horrible. If you are looking to move up on the scale, don’t bother. They have favorited only the people they like. It’s sad the way people only choose who they think would be a good match when others also try their best to show how good they are for a certain position ."
bad,Would not recommend this place to anyone. Changed in the wrong direction from original owners visions They decided after 8 years of loyal service to let me go because the manager at that time liked the associate below me better.  The manager was terrible and had all his favorites and you did not do what he wanted he would shun. I bow down to no one except the good Lord above.
bad,this job was the worst job i ever had...i worked at the service desk for 6 years and i was treated like garbage every day...management doesnt give a darn about its employees and they NEVER back up their associates and will throw an associate under the bus at any time...i cried going to work and leaving work cause i was ALWAYS expected to donthe job of 3 people all by myself with no help...when i quit it was the happiest day of my life
bad,"In spite of the very low pay scale, I enjoyed my job under my first store manager. The security and benefits were great, and my store manager was great at recognizing my achievements and my ongoing training abilities. The other things I enjoyed at my job were meeting great people and especially the Veterans, so I could thank them for their service."
bad,"All employees at the merrimack depot hate working there, no matter what the department is. The management is experimental, meaning there are managers going in and out and the management is dysfunctional. I needed to lessen my hours for a week because a family member had gotten into an accident and couldn't take care of themselves and they denied me any days off or shortened hours. Don't work here. Worse management in any workplace I've ever experienced."
bad,"In over 10 years working as a sub contractor they only decreesed the pay to us Contractors, the advertise free installation and expect us to do it for free, our pay is less than 55% of what we use to get paid for the same job, the quality of the material is very poor and they up sale the customers and promise unrealistic promises, very disloyal, treacherous to customers and contractor."
bad,The main problem is older people who are power hungry as a manager. The other problem is they never offer current employees an advancement they just hire someone over you In the position you were never offered and then you answer to the person you literally just trained a week ago. These people are a joke!
bad,"I worked at Home Depot for about 4 years and it's one of the worst jobs I've ever had. My supervisor literally leaked all my personal information to other co-workers. He told them where I lived and also gave them my phone number so they could continue to harras me online. There's no such thing as privacy in Home Depot even though they always have you watch videos about not leaking anyone's personal information. And when you try and report all your incidents to management you're basically ostracized and made to look like you're the one doing something wrong. If you'd like to work for a company that plays favorites and doesn't care about hard working employees this is the job for you. If you want to work for a company that only cares about slackers that want to be in your personal business then this is a great company for you, otherwise run the other way."
bad,"The Home Depot is a good store but you need to find the right home depot, the one I worked at the employees were mainly elderly, lazy, and rude. "
bad,"I along with the most of the team feel the manager being a sexist, he does Favoritism , and over works hard workers hard workers get in trouble while people who slack off always get away with stuff"
bad,I worked for this company for less then a month and I was ready to go by the second week. They sit you in front of a computer for the first few days to train which is fine but after that they just expect you to know exactly what to do. They throw you on the sales floor with other associates that don’t want to help and let’s not start on the management. The managers don’t know you exist if you’re new( which half the associates in this store are) they walk right by you without even asking if you need help. The rudeness of management is another problem...I was asked by a manager why I was in the break room when I I had just arrived....I explained that I went to get something and then I was told I wasn’t supposed to be in there til break time. I am a woman and there are certain things that a woman needs during a certain time of the month and cannot carry pockets filled with them either. I did not feel like I needed to go into detail about what I needed from the break room as it was a personal matter and something I didn’t feel comfortable addressing with a male. The store Itself  is filthy and majority of the items are covered in a thick layer of dust. The few members of management that you see either are not paying attention to you or are basically clocking how long you go to the bathroom or the break room. I don’t know if it is just the Harper Woods store or if all Home Depot’s are this way but I would not recommend this store to anyone.
bad,"Ones employment is day buy day. Management is out of control. Reporting any issues on sup or managers get you retaliation  to the extreme , witch will force some people to quit or make up some sort of write up that eventually gets you termanated. Atlanta corporate office need to start cracking down on dirty  store managers and especially Met supervisors and Met Distric managers. Met supervisior in  my store was a insult,  As he implemented favoritism  and retaliation  on a scale that has never been seen. Funny thing as he was the owner of many violations and falceifaction on store phone activity"
bad,Was hired and put on the customer service desk with legitimately zero training. My dept manager was too busy wandering with her co-worker friend to do her job so it was all on me. I tried to find other ways to learn and was told to stop asking questions by every manager there. How can a person do their job without training? I would call their methods anti-training. Do I need to be hazed in or something? The Asst Store manager is an absolute a**hole along with 90% of the staff. I feel like if people in my town knew how poorly I've been treated this store would lose a lot of business to the local Lowe's. Eff this place.
bad,Needs better management! Horrible scheduling! Not an enjoyable part of the job. They ask you to do things 15-30 minutes before you leave. Supervisors are horrible too.
bad,Its a very inconsistent place not crew and management wise. The benefits are great but on every other aspect it was a very poor experience. I cannot recommend this place for employment.
bad,"Mgt promotes friends and family Management does not stick to the company policy and picks favorites. . Like being in high school drama. Only reason you get fired is for attendance, or harassment claims. People who have worked there for 2+ years get paid the same amount of new hires. Cashiers are constantly pushed to get ask people to apply for credit card, punished if you do not get a certain amount. Unless you are a cashier you barely get a full break. Customer's happiness over EVERYTHING"
bad,Honestly I had worked there for almost a year and this place was just horrible very unprofessional they would have so much favoritism. They make you feel uncomfortable when they talk about others. Head cashiers don’t take you into consideration when you have a problem. The fez has attitude problem and doesn’t give a warm welcome. The fez talks about all cashiers behind back and treats people as if they don’t matter in the store nor does she resolve problems. As for the hours your hours will get lower within a month. They hire new people every time but cut hours. They send people on their break so late or way to early. They don’t know how to manage their time before the store closes. They will exclude you out of certain events if you aren’t buddy buddy with them. As for the front end of cashiers their is to much unprofessionalism and to much drama that no one stops. You stress everyday and feel the tension every single day. If you do work here I suggest you keep to yourself and just do your job because everyone just talks or is fake. If there is a problem they don’t solve it so call directly to HR because no matter how many times you talk to the manager or your fez they won’t fix it. Over all the store it’s self if horrible and unorganized.
bad,Typical retail. Not a living wage regardless of work performed. No raises given regardless of merit. Get in and get out as fast as possible. No reason to work here except as a stepping stone to a better job.
bad,"It was ok. I worked there as a cashier and bookkeeper., fast paced . You can learn at of different things from every department and can cross train to help out in different departments"
bad,"if you're sick it doesn't matter if you have a doctors note they won't bother to accept it, all they care about is if you have sick leave or not. so during the probationary period and you get sick you're screwed."
bad,"The Home Depot does not value experience, skills, or expertise in their associates.  I have 30+ years experience in my trade.  I was able to provide educated answers to customers questions, create solutions for their needs and problems concerning their projects, and yet I was paid minimum wage.  I was paid the exact same as a recent high school graduate that was hired in my department who had no knowledge whatsoever about our department.  After one year you might get a .45 cent increase.  In short, THD uses people and their skills without fair compensation. They present themselves as being all about the employee, but they don't even offer an employee discount.  I stayed one year only so that I could have a year of customer experience to add to my resume. About half of the other associates in the store were hard workers and pleasant to work with, but the remaining were actual embarrassments to the ideal of customer service. Management always seemed blissfully unaware or unconcerned about ways to enhance the experience for the customer.  Real issues and real problems were always responded with ""It is what it is"".  I actually thought I would scream if I heard those words even one more time.  Management speaks to the associates in acronyms and corporate talk during morning pep talks as they explain the sales goals for the day leaving you confused and disconnected. What a pathetic place for anyone to work at. If you must take a minimum wage job you can do much better than The Home Depot. Choose a company where you don't go home at the end of your shift feeling used and embarrassed."
bad,"This place is ridiculous!! Stay away if you can!! They will tell you that there is opportunity for advancement but they don't mention that only if your one of their favorite, other words you gonna do some major kissing up and that's not me! Let me start off with what they said I did but will not show me the proof. The whole 5034 building is under surveillance and they study the unclear video footage. They fired me and another associate accusing us of horseplay on equipment. They said they looked at footage and said that it looked like we collided into each other on our forklift and pallet Jack. I argued the fact that is false and then they changed their wording and said well it looked like we got very close with the equipment, and mind you they also pulled another associate off equipment because they also said that it could of been him in the video because the jacket he wears while working fits the description. So they pull 3 of us of our equipment for investigation because they are not sure who it is exactly in the video and yet they don't show this footage to us either!! I've had fmla days there at work from a doctor's order for 2 to 3 days a month if I would need it, which I would use at least 1 day a month for my issue. Well the horseplay that I think they are talking about is when the one associate and I took each other's label off our lift and because of my fmla days they lied and are saying that we collided into each other. The put the associate with the jacket back on the lift and told him that they are 70% sure it wasn't him but not 100% sure. Then a couple later they"
bad,"Downside:  understaffed in all departments & hot in summer & cold in winter"
bad,"The company is a terrible place to work, especially if you're a part of the IT support organization.  Little to no cooperation from other teams & 0 company provided training.  As such, next to impossible to develop skills to move up or to another team within IT.  Independent learning is exploited instead of fostered, and compensation is almost a joke.  "
bad,"You work and work giving them our all about at the and you do not move up and the one move up are people that should not. At first the store management that was there was good. Then a new management come in and was lay people off to have people he know coming in. He told me that I didn't positive attitude in the work place. and the people work with me said that. So I challenge him to have them coming and tell. Then I find out why he said that he was mad i didn't say hi or good morning to him. I told how can I tell you morning when i don't see you. the difficult in the old management was he when to say or walk around the store so you know he was there. Anyways my pay was 11.00hr/ 20-30hr and if you did something they "" punish"" you by giving you 12-13hr."
bad,assistant manager randy at the Cleveland tn. store is a lazy horrible boss who doesn't care for anybody unless they are white. he will do anything to get ahead and step on anybody who gets in his way.
bad,"I can not write a fair review of Home Depot. I felt they were very unfair with pay raises. They kept loading on more workload without compensation. Very deceiving management. I do not have anymore mere to say, except that I will never work there again; nor purchase from HD."
bad,They exploit the majority i not all of the part timers in certain Home Depot. The hire you with the impression that its home and family oriented and it was before they started becoming super competitive with other franchises and once Amazon was our only competitor. Working Customer service had a laundry list of job descriptions. Mangers do their best the problem is with CORPORATE.
bad,"If you can survive not making money for the first 6 months, give it a shot. If they wanted to stop turnover they would provide at least a modest salary."
bad,"Home Depot is a substandard employer, paying employees as little as possible and offering part time hours only to drive corporate profit. I do not recommend working for HD."
bad,"I was ""paid out"" for being honest in my exit interview. Getting management involvement is like pulling teeth. Management allows customers to walk all over associates, talk abusively to associates and still gives the customer what they want."
bad,"When I started we had a great manager. He worked very hard, was always ready to answer any questions, and created a good work atmosphere. Then he was transferred ( I heard that he received I demotion). All because of some petty corporate bias toward him. His transfer had nothing to do with store performance."
bad,"managers are racist in Florida and only hire family, move them up only. instead of helping employees they don't listen just pre-judge. "
bad,"After two seperate stints with HD as Key Contractor it has become obvious the top down culture is to shoot first, ask questions later - or not at all."
bad,"i believe that things could be done differently, making examples out of people and telling them one thing and doing another is not right. you should do what you say you are going to do."
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company , especially if you're looking at a ""front end"" position. The management only moves when it's beneficial to them. No one cares about you, no one cares about your personal life. All they care about is the money they make off of you."
bad,"Home Depot provides competitive wages and a good orientation package upon hiring of new employees. Home Depot does provide career development planning, performance reviews and health and safety standards by policy. The Home Depot management does not practice these policies consistently."
bad,"great benefits"
bad,"On holidays and special occasions, the store fed the employees. At Christmas, there was a dinner where clearance items that were not moving off the shelves were handed out as door prizes but spouses were not invited to attend. Most of us were working part-time and had no benefits that were usable, i.e. medical ""discounts"" that you had to pay for monthly that paid a few dollars off one year's prescription of one drug, a discount on one doctor visit per year, nothing for tests or emergency services. I was called to come in on average of once a week to cover for someone who called off, and usually came in because I needed the paycheck, and often stayed over for someone calling off. I willingly covered other departments and did jobs I was not assigned to and had no training for, and that was my downfall. "
bad,Treats managers horribly and would not work for the company. Doesn't follow policy well. Definitely make sure you don't get injured because they will retaliate against you even though its against the law.
bad,To have the day to day activities where no management is not provided and is not guarenteed to have more input to make job experience will never compete
bad,You must be willing to wait for job advances due to management and corporate transfers taking up roles within the structure of the store. The pay scale is not of one that is at a good level either.
bad,"I would not work for this company again, ever.  Very unaccommodating, dishonest management. Practices very unlawful acts. They do not acknowledge hard workers."
bad,"pay and hours are minimal, management does not care & won't listen to safety concerns; fellow workers and customers are the best thing they have going"
bad,If you work for Home Depot. You better hope management likes you otherwise you are in the dark for any promotion available even if you are the most qualified. The company is good for someone part-time looking for something to do.
bad,"When you first get the job its alright with decent hours. But the longer you are there the less that they do you for you, I was going to school and went to church on Sundays and when I asked for sometime off especially for a job required test that i had to take they continuously gave me excuses of why i couldn't have the time off."
bad,"I was dismayed that I was not chosen for the tools department position, especially when the person chosen was another employees sibling who had less time on the job. I was promised to be trained as a fork lift operator, which never happened."
bad,"managers are money hungry and play favoritism.  no one is supposed to have a ""set schedule""  but if you know someone...  yup, you don't work nights and get every Sunday off.  leaving the rest of the department to work every Sunday.  benefits are great but take half your paycheck.  kids??  hope you have a spouse with cheaper benefits somewhere else.  if you are looking for FT job, don't count on HD.  they only want part time so they can precisely control hours spent and cut employee time without repercussions from labor department and they get a bigger bonus"
bad,"The company is great and they do offer a fair pay."
bad,"Cutthroat environment, very low pay, no management backup when things went bad. Training was adequate, but barely.  Cashiers were expected to be at work no matter what, even if ill."
bad,"I was the night manager, salary manager leaves as soon I get there, never comunícate with me. They was scheduled until 11they leave at 8. They come late in the morning has to stay until a salary manager decide to come in. No thank you or anything. They manager put so much stress on the people it’s no funny."
bad,"When I first interviewed I was  excited about the company, what they  offered  and the fact that once I went to college. None of that came to fruition"
bad,Fast work place worked outside loaded pro members aka contracters so on ran forklifts very hands on but horible management started to fire all the knoledgable workers witch made work extremely difficult
bad,"No team atmosphere racially biased management, bad place to work, vagrants all over, high theft, rude customers in senior community. Very inept management team"
bad,"It’s truly astonishing to see how mean people actually are when it comes to spending, they question everything that is done by you, then add insult to injury by complaining to management."
bad,"Poor management. Too much drama, as if I was back in high school."
bad,"This place is a nightmare, poor scheduling and lack of wanting to take responsibility will be common from management. They don't want full time employees and only care how much someone kisses up to advance. Very disorganized and alot of inner turmoil. I hated working here and am glad I am moving on."
bad,Very unprofessional. This was my worst job ever. the management is unbelievable. One thing about them is that don't fire anyone really unless you do no call no shows or are stealing.
bad,Low opinion of this job in general. The only employees that make enough money to live on are the managers. Most of the workers are lazy and have no sense of urgency and their customer service and competence is lacking. The benefits are too expensive. The cost was about 45% of my paycheck! Ridiculous
bad,"Home depot is very racist place to work. It is truly who you know not what you know. I worked there for two years and complain several times to management about a hostile environment, I reported and nothing was done. If you are hardworking but not in with someone in management you will not succeed."
bad,I have problems but co-workers didn't care.
bad,Boring. I learned a lot about customer support. I didn't like management. Workplace culture not too much teamwork. The hardest part selling credit apps. Don't have most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"This was by far one of the worst companies. The senior managers/ executives are so concerned with kissing Home Depot's butts that they have created a cutthroat, throw each other and everyone else under the bus environment. Not collaborative. No trust and the culture which was the initial draw for the company is a joke. "
bad,Leadership is lacking at the VP level.  Company is metric-focused but does not spend much time on what the real metric should be.  This results in work around the metrics instead of solving the real problem.
bad,"As a cashier we're asked to go above and beyond our duties with little to no encouragement or motivation, or especially recognition. Unnecessary stress is added regularly."
bad,poorly managed with no set process's for work. No regard fro good work life balance. Would not recommend anyone to work for them...also they give no store discounts to any employees.
bad,The pay was nice but not worth the stress inflicted by management and putting up with inappropriate comments from managers that was successfully covered up by the manager on many different occasions.
bad,The management is not at all willing to work with you on issues. It's pretty much like any other corporate organization. They don't care about the employees.
bad,"Customer service is number one priority at the Home Depot, but sadly that is about the only good value they have. I am not to sure but there quitting rate must be trough the roof, task to do often come with little or no practical training. A bonus check for the hard work of associates for the whole year can be about 26.00 dollar check for a nearly full time employee while managers get in the few thousands 3 times a year. Staffing is grossly minimal, under staffing is always an issue for one of the biggest retailers not to have adequate workers in the store is regular due to the fact that they do not want to pay for overtime or call in extra help when needed."
bad,"Home Depot is too focused on the political nonsense during promotions and advancement opportunities. Constant misleading reviews with no follow up from management to help assist with growth. Salaried managers work ridiculous hours (11+ a day, 6 days a week during spring) and are usually not assisted at getting them close to home."
bad,"A typical day started out helping customers. on free time stocking returns, cleaning, and stocking items that were not out on the shelves. I learned a lot about mixing paint and people skills. the management was great always understanding and super helpful. The culture was a mazing everyone was super nice and always there to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job in my opinion was the rush that would happen early morning and mid afternoon. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere, everyone was just really genuinely."
bad,A serious amount of favoritism and butt kissing goes on in this company. Thats the easiest way to get promoted. Hard work? Forget about it. All the guys who run the show are pushed back and just congratulated behind closed doors but managers take all the credit.
bad,"There's no reason to work at HD unless you are retired, bored or have no life at all. It's rather boring, heavy lifting, some attitudes are terrible and chaos reigns when you cannot find a product."
bad,"I have no opinion regarding working at hdms, I was a job and now I am looking for an position that I can be proud about and enjoy working with a company that value the employees as well as the customers."
bad,"The politics at the Home Depot are ridiculous. Work loads can vary, but typically there are one or two associates socializing with the management while the last associate is working like a dog. All of the management within any district will be related, friends, dating, married to, etc. The job itself is pretty simple, but there are often stretch assignments, and the hardest part of the job is that one supervisor or manager will ask you to do something, then another will come by and have you do something else, inevitably leading to both tasks being impossible. And don't imagine that there will be a way to avoid being held accountable. I've worked for a lot of companies, but this one is pretty vicious."
bad,"As a young woman working in the toughest department at home depot aka Flooring and Decor, I cannot wait to leave! customers are so rude and belittling towards me because I am a female and doubt my knowledge due to my gender. Scheduling is insane and sometimes your left alone for hours to manage 10 different aisles in the entire department plus returns. smh its a mad house. You have to be mentally, spiritually, and physically strong to survive here."
bad,"Pay was alright for what it was, however the location I worked at didn't even have an upper management structure anymore.  Was injured several times on the job due to safety precautions not being met by the company."
bad,The managers don't know what they are doing and act very unprofessional. The workers that are close to management do not have to do much work and they are the full-timers. The scheduling is horrible and not flexible.
bad,Pay was not good at all especially for everything I did while I was work there. This job will be for teenagers not grown ups that have bills. I would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,Very stressful job. Mean and nasty Department Heads who only care  about themselves and not the associates. A lot of backstabbing going on. Management doesn't care
bad,"The job was a fast paced environment, back breaking labor, and it was 9pm until 7am. I was injured working there, but since I was a temporary employee, they terminated me after 4 months of work, as I was no longer of use to them"
bad,"The hours were inconsistent with some weeks I was scheduled 30 hours and then the next I would receive 8 hours. The schedule changed constantly and no consideration when put on a closing shift one night and expected back in 8 hours to open the next morning. Was told would be transferred to another department because being a cashier left me standing around a lot and it makes for a very long work day, I would rather stay busy, but after just 2 weeks in a fast paced paint department I was scheduled for 3 weeks back at register because I was always able to sign new credit customers."
bad,good place for a young worker looking for a temporary  job but not for someone looking to have a career. management was clueless and very discriminatory
bad,"Some of the staff are not so positive with the employee's. they stress customer service to strong, hours for the employee's vary and it make difficult."
bad,Stressful Job. No support for the employees. Did not have an advocate.  Change was constant and everyone had to react rather than be proactive. Not fun!
bad,"This job is very stressful. As a cashier, you are required to constantly ask customers to sign up for the Home Depot credit card. The management allows certain people to dictate where they will work even though it is unfair to the other people in the same role. Instead of promoting from within, they will hire outside of the company first. If you apply for one job, it is unlikely that it will be the position you would be hired for. The attendance policy is very unfair. If you are ill, it is expected that you come to work anyway or you will be given points for missing work and ultimately terminated. It doesn't matter if you have a doctor's excuse that says you should not be at work."
bad,"I worked for 1 year in Building Material & Lumber, 8 months in Milwork and 1 year as an order puller in deliveries. I enjoy the people I work with. I learned to operate 4 kinds of  machinery  but  no extra pay. I  don't  mind working hard for a fair wage. This might be a good first job, but not a long term job."
bad,"depending on the management team, the home depot can be a rewarding job. After many years, I have had multiple teams both wonderful and vindictive. Watch your 6."
bad,expect to work very hard for ten hours with no downtime. little to no training. everyone is on finals because the the management is a joke. the management team always talks down to you in a disrespectful tone and is constantly changing because the home depot standards are just to high and over whelming for anyone to actual complete there goals. theres a big turn around because no one can stay employed here whether its the poor management communication or the extreme amount of work they expect you to do a day.
bad,"i worked at two different stores.  when i was hired i work at a well organized store but when i move to FL. the store was not ran well, no one help each other, and i was written up for some of the dumbest reason. (called 3 hr ahead to let them know i couldnt come in got told its a no call no show)"
bad,"The worst ""management"" EVER!!!!!! Except for one of the asms. Only there maybe a few hours a week and played favorites. I was there almost 3 years and was constantly moving up from part time freight to full time garden associate to garden recovery captain to power care specialist!"
bad,"Stressful place to work "
bad,Worked for the company twice both of my experiences I had very poor management. Its retail mentality your dispensable and they treat you like that. I have heard similar stories from other employees around the company
bad,"Very poor training involved, After their ""training period"" you were told to go on the floor and I had no idea or direction as to what was expected as well as very low wages"
bad,"Started out good and had some fun developing people, but like most all the cared about was themselves and how they would get somewhere and step on others to get there.  They are inconsistent in delivery, want more and more with recognition, and when they do the sr management is not there to commend.  Don't listen to the promises, and don't trust the management team.  They will use anything of an opportunity to discredit you. The gave a compensitory raise of a $1 to keep people ther because there are many businesses around paying more, but little do they know this is not what will keep them there.  Many about to jump to go elsewhere because of the poor sr management group and the inconsistencies and lies."
bad,I love the people I work with but I do not like the company overall. they allow their associates to steal from customers but will only fire them due to attendance issues. They over work us and under pay us. Not a great company to work for when your part time. Hence why I am leaving.
bad,"Once upon a time, this place valued employees, preferring full-time staff to part-timers because they knew they were more dependable. Departments were staffed and that staff knew what they were doing. Through many executive and middle management changes, this culture was stripped down to the bones. I worked here for a decade and would never, in a million years, recommend it to a friend or their children, even as a part time job."
bad,"For the work that we do and being the number one met team in the U.S. we don't get much pay, For the work that we do we should start out at 13 and hour and being pushed to stay number one with no pay raise is very insulting for us workers when the man pushing us get a nice bonus for having everything done before everyone else and I'm a team player and not going to kill myself every week to not even pay my own bills!"
bad,"Home Depot management only cares about themselves, they don't appreciate their hardworking experienced associates and would use them until they can hire a cheaper replacement. No effort to helping customers period."
bad,Every time I brought a safety violation to managements attention it was ignored. They also spend more money on political lobbying than they do on maintaining a safe and unhostile work place for associates
bad,"was good until management change then they let me go and replaced me with his own people and called it performance, most work days are 10-12 hrs. i loved it until the new manager took over"
bad,Management and the way the runs things there could be ALOT BETTER. Management did whatever they wanted while the associates suffered. The way they treat their customers as well. Customers Constantly  seeking helping a theres no one to be found
bad,"Multi-task and prioritize customer needs to ensure 110% customer service."
bad,"It often it so busy and understaffed, that proper training was basically impossible. Management expected you to know how to do everything after a month of being on floor. What happens is it is quiet and you are being taught how to do a complex order on the system. However, then many customers come and the trainer finishes the process without you, as you are now paying attention to the customers. Thus, you learn how to start the process, but never finish."
bad,Watching a coworker who started the same day you did be trained in everything. Even in supervisor tasks. Watching this coworker show rudeness to all. Never worked for HD before and coworker had an interview to move up after 3 months.  Did not move up and still spoiled by mgt.  Coworkers are coworkers.
bad,Long term goals are not a part of this companies bio. Hard work is often unrewarded and overlooked. A hard days work should earn a hard days pay.
bad,you walked in with more work u could handle while other people did nothing even when asked for help. Management was a joke if you had an issue with a customer 95% of the time you would get in trouble. they don't care for the employees as much as their customers.
bad,"I worked at the home depot nearly 1 year and the whole time that I was employed at the home depot it felt like a prison. I am sorry, but if you like people looking at you seeing what you are doing every 5 minutes, then work here. But, if you don't like people telling you what to do, how to do it, for how long to do it, how to act, what to say, and even how to walk, then do not work here. Almost every manager that works here is a control freak. They will literally fire anyone who merely looks at them the wrong way or god forbid makes a mistake. The moment I got hired here I was deceived into thinking that this was the place for me to grow, but soon became my worse nightmare. Management plays a whole lot of favoritism and chooses to keep employees that will only kiss their behind and even lick their boots. This place really sucked and I hated the way in which management put their own self-inflicted and stubborn agendas rather then helping employees to grow. Here, there is not room to grow because all managers, supervisors, and even general managers are all looking out for their own interests before the company itself. Very sad and stressful environment. Feel sorry for all managers and employee alike. Grow up."
bad,"come into work, get my machine (picker, forklift, or pallet jack) dependent on the day and what i was working on that day. Unloaded trucks or got product from shelves for outbound trucks."
bad,All they want are bodies. Constant influx of new employees due to the loss of existing employees. No effort to retain good people. Fit their system or you won't last. Benefits are non existing and even full  time employees can't afford health insurance for a family.
bad,"The Home Depot is no longer a company that you want to start a lengthy career with. They have a very fast turn around of employees now because of the way the employees are treated. I was lied to by the Home Depot and have documentation to prove so. Should you make more than $16 $17 per hr. you have an invisible target on your back. The Home Depot use to have many knowledgeable employees on the floor. Now they are mostly young adults with little too no experience. Most of the employees that use to work for Home Base, see the same thing happening to The Home Cheapo. + going down the drain :("
bad,Back stabbing they do well here!! Learned alot and had alot of responsibilities and did it well. Certified in everything
bad,it was ok working at the home depot I was it depends on which store you work at the work was not too hard.the people are friendly
bad,They are not going to pay any kind of living wage. Full time? Nah. Gotta save money for the stock holders and the execs. People are lazy and want you to tell them where every thing is located. Look at the signs.! That's how employees found items.
bad,"I love indoor  plants and outdoor gardening. Unfortunately, the Home Depot hires a lot of kids still in high school or college that have no interest in their jobs which makes it difficult for people who DO enjoy their work from doing a good job."
bad,"This company is very laid back and people come in the store to retrieve items for home improvement. Needless to say, the management display very poor communication skills and are very bias towards the individuals who are not their favorites"
bad,Management was horrible…This store had no team spirit. And employees did not work well together…Always under staffed and customers didn’t get the service they deserved.
bad,A company where key carriers who are hourly and not salaried members of management are responsible for doing the duties of salaried members while they do anything possible not to be out on the sales floor and do there job.
bad,"hostile work environment, management uses employees with no advancement, will let you go for the slightest infraction, pay is very low"
bad,"was very hard to please managers. they was always looking for mistakes to put on you. had great friendships come from here, and just felt like i had no future in the end with no support from management."
bad,This job was very easy since I am able to lift heavy objects.  The people I worked with were a blast but the management couldn't seem to get their act together.  Surprising amount of drama.
bad,Train new associates with no resources or training at any level. No knowledge of position at time of hire. No knowledge of the position they will assume.
bad,"The job itself is a great job, I love the day to day challenges and learning experiences with the customers and the job. But the management here are unprofessional and discriminate in many ways. I have only been here for 5 months and in that short time I have been harassed, lied to and even been called a liar in many round about ways, I have been treated pour by another employee and have been to management at least 4 times and nothing has been solved. I have been told things were going to happen and never did."
bad,"Ive seen the ups and downs of this place and as time went on it just got worse. From an employee,all departments are understaffed leaving you to cover multiple departments regardless if you know product in those neighboring departments. EXTREME mico-management and very much about who you know and not what you know when it comes to career advancement. Guidelines change regularly depending on the associate and the task at hand. Recognition is very much unheard of unless it is blatantly obvious ie a customer letter or VOC comment. This used to be a good company with decent pay but that has gone to the way side, only to be replaced by mindless drones that will accept cheap pay and that can be easily replaced if you have an opinion. Veteran employees are no different, and they actually prefer to ""weed"" out the veterans, to work in newer cheaper employees that will do the same tasks and more for much less pay, but that seems to be the way America is headed."
bad,"The company is good to work for but the managers at the Broadview store do not know how to treat employees with respect. The store manager Tim,is very ignorant and rude to employees, and shows a total lack of respect"
bad,Advancement does not depend on job performance and dependability. It depends on who you know and how you play the game of internal politics.
bad,"Probably one of the worst corporate cultures I've seen. Coming from a fast paced, productive startup environment this was the exact opposite. Dress code is business. The tech stack is behind by about 10 years and management is not responsive to adopting modern software development practices. Managers and above are dinosaurs in IT years and could care less about improving development processes which are loaded with unnecessary bottlenecks. Most Manager or Lead Developer positions do not come from a development background and are more liasons to the business. Offshore developers create poor quality product and everyone is in firefighting mode fixing bugs in production due to poor software development practices. They have 8:30am Monday meetings to have people talk about what they have done over the weekend. Work here 2 years and no modern software shop will want you because they are so behind."
bad,"Absolutely hated this place, you would get  an outstanding review yet only get a nickel raise. Not uncommon for companies, but at the same time you will be getting paid less than the new hires. Not to mention the managers should not be managers."
bad,"La caisse, rien de spécial  . Les  opportunités moyen. Le management correct.  Collaborateurs très bon. L'aspect le plus difficile le non respect de promesses (le soir et fin de semaine très rare et les conges ensemble très rare aussi) Donc aucun vie social pour un poste   : temps partial  de 8 a 20 heures par semaine ."
bad,never will i ever work for this company ever again. starting off i was in love with my job but as time progressed management every opportunity they could to steal happiness away from most of their employees.
bad,"All of the managers suck and don't do their jobs so it ends up being a bad place to work, but their are great benefits."
bad,"Being at the store at 5am to open up and start stocking on heavy equipment and cleaning up people's mess who didn't close right and making sure my aisles are check up on for missing or need replacing."
bad,"Many employees had a really negative, selfish attitude toward their work, fueled by the store management's apathy toward employee well-being and lack of respect toward employees. Standards were inconsistent, ranging from incredibly low to fantastically too high, and there's no incentive toward doing your job well, because regardless of how hard you try, no one else does. The department supervisors were, for the most part, very competent, but part-time associates were a mixed bag. "
bad,Don't apply to work as a kitchen designer unless you want the frustration of your life.  First of all HD does no longer hire trained or experienced kitchen designers in the stores.  A warm body will do.  I saw many people angry about designs that did not work and very poor services provided.  If you are a new designer hoping to get experience I would go somewhere else.  Any training you will get will come too late.  Low pay for what is expected.  This store had very low moral and high turn-over.
bad,the company is AWESOME this location was one of the poorest I've ever been in but made it a point to get promoted out of that situation
bad,Come in and your store Team Meetings started. How to tag item's. My Management was great. Hardest part was taking care of the phone call's coming in. Doing returns @customer service desk.
bad,"The only way you can get ahead is to become ""buddy buddy"" with HR who is completed immature and unprofessional. Management appears to have an open door policy only after you contact coorporate."
bad,"I have been with The Home Depot for 6 years, and at first the company wasn't so bad. I wasn't comfortable with the different hours everyday, but I became used to it. The store became The ""Horrible"" Depot once new management came in after the others were either promoted or terminated. There was an obscene amount of favoritism and lack of communication in the management level. None of the ASM's were on the same page, and they were never into developing the other associates. Due to the fact that associate development has come to a complete stop it caused the upper management to hire Department Supervisors from outside of the store with no Home Improvement experience. I've heard that other stores aren't as bad, but my store should be torn down. We have management stepping down, ASM's going to Lowes, the overall morale is at an all time low and I hope this place gets fixed soon. Thank God I got out before I was fired, they discriminated and threatened me because I was not a ""suck-up""."
bad,Customer Service and operating machinery all day pretty much.  The hardest part of the job is busting your butt all day for pretty much nothing.
bad,"Show up earley with a smile on my face ready, willing, and able to please.Happy to be at work and happy to have a job.If i am at the customer service desk I am doing a whole lot of what I truely love to do, work with people.problem solveing, and making the customer happy and satisfied.If cashiering giving the very best customer service there is.If greeting helping everyone get their needs met.It is a phycially demanding job, which is fine no problem with that.There just is not enough opertunity for full time work or benifits for a very long time if ever.I continue to learn alot about home projects, Hardware stuff, computors,and always more and more customer service, problem solving,and public relations.I love my coworkers, excellent managment.As I said before just not enough opertunity,nor soon enough for what I currently need in my life."
bad,"The best thing about my job were the co-workers with-in my department. Regular store associates sabotaged any leads they gave us by quoting prices in the store.  All they ever talked about were numbers.  I had a store associate tell me RSW was up by 100% the reason for that is because the year before they did not sell anything! The worse part was we got no leads and were expected to be in stores self-generating leads with no compensation.  Was told when I applied that all leads came from stores and internet.  Managers are pressured into hiring people that the revenue stream can't support.  They will tell you anything to bring you on board.  Once there do not expect any training or real support.  Manager never rode with me one time.  Also they have an IPAD that is supposed to make things easier.  I was never trained on it. Almost every time I called my manager for help he was at home. Poor Poor management.  Also, the pricing was not at all competitive in our market.  You could only hope that before you got there they had no other estimates.  I had people outright laugh when I presented the price.  Do yourself and your family a favor....Run!  Also home depot does offer insurance, the only people that can afford it are managers.  In fact at the THD only 3 people make a living wage at any store, they are the manager, the assistant manager, and  the special services manager."
bad,"Meeting new people and interating with others, is always the case at "
bad,"Working at Home Depot I did learn a lot. how to manage people, time, and customer service all at the same time. Management wasn't always there therefore I had to do a lot more then usual. I made choices such as returns, money issues, upset customers, and various of other things. I managed the change drawer, which is consisted of some hefty money and handing it out to cashiers who needed it. I managed the front end also consisted of making sure the cashiers had enough money in their drawer also not too much, managed lines, customers who had issues, and making sure the cashiers were on their lunches and breaks on time."
bad,If you need a stable job this is the place but if you are looking for a job that pays you should rethink that strategy
bad,"I have nothing nice to say about this company. They are not a good company to work for, and they are horrible to their employees."
bad,Don't count on getting a promotion at the Yonkers Home Depot.
bad,"I worked at the Home Depot call Center in Kennesaw and I cannot speak on the stores. But this place is less than organized. They are big on telling you that they have culture and values but do not practice them. Management is cutthroat and conniving and there is very little regard for the employees. Room for advancement is nil. There are people presently with bachelors, masters, and doctorates who cannot move up because their managers and supervisors who barely have associates have the power to hold them back. Overall this is a good place to work if you are only trying to earn some holiday money. Other than that head for the hills. Alorica is better."
bad,Home Depot was a good company to work for and the benefits were good
bad,Home Depot is an awesome company! Ricoh the contractor I actually work for has poor management. No room for advancement. My job is repetitive and easy.
bad,This company has poor communication and follow through from corporate down to individual store. They are terrible with fixing issues involving outside contractors used for installs. There is too much favoritism not enough good management. An entry-level associate has close to 34 managers to answer to. It is awful.
bad,"this job is not for everyone. It is the toughest retail job I have ever held. a typical day at work involves making paint while answering 8-18 different customer question a minute. The typical front facing and down stocking. the average day you will walk 9-16 miles. "
bad,"Job was basically waiting on customers, answsering phones, processing credit applications, etc."
bad,"Nice hours, great place to work. Always busy. Extra holiday pay and time in a half was nice too"
bad,The Ontario RDC has many things they need to improve on. The overall company is great but the warehouse there is atrocious. Management is very poor as in they had no clue what was going on. When something went wrong they had no idea what to do and would most often have to go to an associate who knew what they were doing. The co workers and environment were the only positive thing about it.
bad,"Inconsistant weekly hours, leave at 10 at night come in at 6am, Company consistantly blocks efficency, marketing is non-existant (ie selling suburban items in city store). Customers don't respect store, employees are given no incentive, do not care. Pay is embarrassing.."
bad,"Home Depot in Albany Oregon, is ran so terribly that I'm surprised they manage to make anything work. The contractor sales associates frequently would give away free stuff and not charge for deliveries, but because of them not doing their job my department couldn't be fully staffed and better able to handle the deliveries.Management frequently turned their backs to the issue and any time my understaffed department had and issue it always fell upon me to take a write up. I was told before taking the position that I was going to become a full time associate and have 40 hours + every week. Upon taking the position I was informed while I was trying to look up my benefits, the manager told me I was mistaken and wasn't going to get benefits or be full time or in fact get 40 hours every week."
bad,"Doing projects, changing batters, cleaning, repair batters, shrink rapp, do have hasmas when needed. etc.."
bad,i love home home depot before i worked for it since i done construction landscaping and such.but as an employee i dont know what to tell you but is compared to walmart.
bad,"wouldnt work there ever again. every store is run differently but the store i was at, the relationship between employees and management was horrible."
bad,"I learned a lot about this ""legend"" and a have had great customers."
bad,"they cut wages to 8,30 hr and want you to do the work of 3 people and dont treat you right no discounts"
bad,"Each store within the Home Depot system is dependent entirely for its internal work environment based upon the store manager and the Department Heads who basicallly run the store. If you get a Dept. Head who knows nothing about the Dept., which happens frequently, as an experienced associate yyou have to do his/her work as well as your own. Also customer service training is almost totally non-existent. You have to train yourself to make sales for the company."
bad,Ok for part timers or college kids they really work with you when it come to scheduling but the pay is pretty horrible for all the work ou have to do
bad,Did not enjoy at all. Extreme travel 100 to 200 miles per day with no gasoline compensation from company.
bad,I love the customers but hated the managment. Everyone is willing to step on anyone to get what they need in this company. They have a really high turn over rate and it's not worth it to work for this company
bad,The management was horrible they treated you like trash if you had no exprience. If one of them had a bad day at home expect yours to be worse!!
bad,"Little training, they sit you in front of a computer for 40 hours watching videos that are worded incorrectly and then expect you to know all of their rules and regulations or you lose your job. It's a joke I would not like to work there again."
bad,"This company use to be good. But beware of the stores in Maryland. I have never met so many under qualified members of management before. They do not appreciate their associates, they will work you to the bone, and give you a lousy $.20 raise. If they want you out, they will find a way to terminate you. Mainly by applying foolish rules to you that most overlook since they are quite petty. Managers blantly tell people of the opposite race that they can't wear particular jewelery becuase they are of a darker complexion and its noticable, where as a white person can since you cant see it. Good luck if you end up working for them!!"
bad,Home Depot lacks clear communication from the employer to the employees. Employees are overburdened with tasks. Staff is often short handed. Devices used to help employees with tasks break and not replaced in an efficient manner.
bad,"While it is DEFINITELY better than working at the largest big box retailer in the world that has art in the title, it is a tough organization to go into as an HR professional.  Ego may be the best way to describe management here.  A good leader knows that having a support through HR is a positive resource and not a stumbling block.  Unfortunately, this organization has a lot of battlefield promotions that stroke egos and does not embrace the value of Human Resources.  This is clear even in the founders' own book."
bad,Not getting enough hours because there were not enough deliveries to go around. Managment was incompetent. Only worried about his bottom line and how we were doing in the race to be the best in our area didnt worry about doing his part to make sure employees knew what where they stood.
bad,VPHR only interested in giving homer awards to people. Not bothered doing anything else to help associates in need. She needs to retire before she does any more damage to people and the office.
bad,"Not a great place to Expand your growth."
bad,"Not a good location to work at due to se*ual harassment, rude managers, rude coworkers, rude customers. Other locations have been better but typically still have heavy se*ual harassment with no training  Management does nothing about it and neither does corporate"
bad,"If you’re the manager favorite you get to do what you want "
bad,"The management does not take care of the associates like the original founder had established, This is not a fun store to work for, pay scales are not fair for employees that have been there long term also, full time is hard to receive and most winter hours drop to 20 hours a week or less. High turnover rate of employees says it all."
bad,"Full time male staff was extremely disrespectful and threatened me. I immediately went to store manager and gave verbal and detailed written report.  Nothing happened. Found through talking to others female employees, that this same employee continually had been reported multiple times before over years, but never got in trouble.  He even taunted me after threatening me, “Go ahead, and report me, nothing will happen.”  And he was right. "
bad,They act like they will help you with problems but they throw you under the bus. Managers have no clue how to manage associates who work they give more work to hard workers and let the ones who do nothing get away with everything. Supervisors don’t know there departments and have no clues how to run them at least at the store I worked at.
bad,"(NOTE THAT THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE)"
bad,Run ! Run ! Run ! The management is  horrible  no room for advancement. It’s not about performance more like who you know..the harassment from customers is unbearable.
bad,"Show favoritism, harass you , slander you, Liars, manipulative, make you do everybody's else's job , don't follow work policy make their own rules and regulations"
bad,Home Depot was a great place to work for until I was sexual harrasment. And the hr and manager make me feel like I was wrong for making an complain. Evenly the Target me. And fired me for ringing up my family members. Which I did in the past. Never got fired . I saw supervisor ringing up family members. And never get fired. But I just because I compliant about being sexual harrass I was fired. This is the home Depot in new Orleans east.
bad,"Sadly, moving up was only done if you were a manager's pal. Very, very low hours. If you were the few chosen who got 40 per week, great. But the rest 18 or less per week. Did they care? No."
bad,"Management and above are unsuccessful and not supportive when needed.  "
bad,"Went in for a supervisor position that was advertised on the Indeed Job site. During the interview, I was told that they promote from within. It was a waste of time and was offered a sales position. They told me that other associates are very willing to help. So many of them just get mad at you for bothering them. So many customers with not enough help. Management is no where to be found. The desk sales associates are mostly talking stories with each other. I was bombarded with several customers and the desk associates could not even help. Their was five of them and none of them helped. To me, they have too much payroll in the wrong places. Management just love to walk around the store and hide. This is a very, very stressful place to work at."
bad,Micromanagement at its worst   If your not salary you do not matter. Company talks about customer service but does not have stores staffed. Many times 1 person covering 2 departments  customers constantly complaining
bad,"A lot of work for a little bit of money."
bad,Only work here if u a student or retired. Pay sucks too many people willing to tell on you. Favoritism on all levels. Have to work there for years before u can really move up. .25 cent pat raised after a year.
bad,"Although working as Merchandising Execution Supervisor has a great schedule, you are in charge of merchandising the whole store and have to deal with Managers, Vendors, and all other Store personnel and they pay you peanuts compared to what you should be compensated for the work done."
bad,"I drove to many stores, alot of Gas and constantly vehicle maintenance was costly.  presure for stats was high! Most of the time worked alone saftey was always a concern no support from corporate and HR "
bad,Management doesn't control what's ordered. Seems like they just get to much of certain items and never enough of others. Overnight Freight is always short handed.
bad,"As an associate for almost 14 years I did not feel appreciated or respected.  It is not a place I would recommend anyone to apply to work at.  The customers were fantastic, the management needs work."
bad,Could be a great job if it was not for politics. Backstabbing in upper management anywhere from salary management level up to a corporate level. And managers not keeping their word.
bad,"Other  employees were horrible, everyone ran around telling on everyone else and trying to get others in trouble to make themselves look good. Was like working with children or back in high school but with old people! Management seemed to promote that sort of behavior."
bad,"As asset prevention, your job is safety and security of your facility. With Home Depot, this is not the case. Home Depot gives you quotas to hit involving shoplifters, at least one per week. So if someone isn’t stealing, you’re screwed. Home Depot assumes because of their 1 billion plus shrink issue that everyone steals all the time, which is not the case. Home Depot will also fire employees due to a complaint without proper investigation, which I unfortunately witnessed many w. Management is in it for themselves, which is understandable but in the end they will not have your back. It is cut throat. Opportunity for advancement has to do with how much brown nosing has been done."
bad,Great Company with awesome benefits. Poor management very petty racist vindictive and retaliatory atmosphere. Great customer relationships. Awful training. Accountability is very low but the pay is good.
bad,"The people are phenomenal! However, when I comes to management, very unprofessional! And instead of copying menard’s 11 percent you should come up with your own ideas."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of the front cashiers being very rude nasty to certain employees. Appeared to be very racist prejudice not wanting certain people to work up front with them. Complained to management watched everything others that werent of Mexican decent did. Everything they didnt want ones that werent of Mexican decent to do. They were doing it I guess because they were Mexican. Ones tried to tell management but Management would just move employees not of Mexican decent to a different area to work. Allowing some of these undocumented Mexicans to continue working in their area doing as they please. On the phone, drinking coffee, taking long extended breaks to go get food from restaurants longer then their 30 minute breaks. Cashiers refused to rotate outside to garden and or lumber area. Horrible environment to work under not being treated equally."
bad,"I worked there for 6 months and I’m either over worked or not working enough. It’s never a good balance. Although they are very flexible, they still make you feel guilty when calling out of work. I do not recommend this job at all. We are always hiring because people are always quitting"
bad,You always start off organizing the department that you work in. but sooner or later the loud speaker announces another department where a customer needs help. you have the option to help but the choice of not being proactive in accommodating co-workers has effects on your value.
bad,"This company has many problems. The management is not professional because they select for the manager position to people that don't have preparation, no union, they don't like union because they want to give the power to the manager. This is a awful experience, and terrible company."
bad,The year I was there I was always stuck as a cashier. I talked to each manager and they’ve would all tell me I had to wait until a position was opened. Well I never had no move up! I got tired of being stuck so I decided to quit
bad,They promise you full-time hours they give you full time hours but then take them away and  tell you that you're a part-time seasonal temp. and take your hours away when hired your hired for a full time flyers postion.they make it  where you can't even afford to live very poor management
bad,They show favoritism and the good ole boy promotion. Home Depot lack black people in management. No work-life-balance. Overworked and less pay. Store managers only concern with bonuses.
bad,"The Zachary home depot is the worst job I ever had. The store manager is horrible,  he knows nothing about customer service  and has no respect for the people that work under him. My advice don't chose The Home Depot as a job or career.  There is no job security."
bad,It was a good job but the tell you what you want to hear and never will move you and they dont put the right weight stuff on their lines. They dont really have air conditioning i mean they do but it does not work well.
bad,"The job was incredibly difficult and physically straining, and it did not pay its dividends to the positions that were working outside, and the culture was weak."
bad,"The survey you Have to tell everyone to take sets you up for failure,  it asks questions about things that have nothing to do with what you did for them and when they are mad about something that has nothing to do with you, you get a bad score and it goes against you,  not fair at all"
bad,"Work at multiple stores.  It is a loud environment with the equipment and the music played by store employees (usually profane lyrics).  More often than not, things are not where they should be.  No two nights are the same."
bad,Not a good place to work alot of cliches and there are groups you have to be in or there is no room for advancement. Management plays favorites and if you dont go along with them they find away to get rid of you.
bad,Horrible place to work in.  Super hostile  work inviorment.  No job opportunities or groth if your not in their group or friends with the management.  I really think goverment should stop spending money on these companies trying to get people to get parcial working.  Cause for a week they give you 4 or 8 hour in the company a week.  That is abusive and ridiculous to say it's  a work.  They have no respect for the worker and the human side of being a parent or being sick.  Treat you  bad.arThinThethitrerobotand
bad,"typical day of work could be busy and not really get qwpeople to help me lift items,I learned that a lot of things I did ,were on my own to the point that it gave me hernias,and deteriorated my spine.some of management was very help while the main one was not good with people and lackeda personable personality,I and others had her sent to another store,due to this.The workplace was great for the most part,we had a good personal relationship.They would have parties when sales were up and celebrate birthdays."
bad,this job there is really long and stressful and there is just not enough pay for your work. i have seen people come and go from this company often....
bad,They are Not pro active against s harassment and discrimination.They will put these low lives right next to you in the same dept knowing what they are like to with no regard to your well being or work enviornment. Workers represent themselves as HR when they are not and confidential info is gossiped about. Unfortunately female mngmt there is bad when it comes to treating people appropriately.
bad,"I have been with this company for six years now and not a lot has changed . First off I will tell you we get a Lot of seasonal people during spring they will give you a lot of hours may through  September. October through  April  you will probably get four hours. If you go into a merchandising  dept you are more than likely going to get a lot of extra work this would be due to not having enough help on the freight  team so everything that is not done by freight the previous night you will be cleaning up their mess the very next day.  Management is going to push you hard to sell credit cards leads and measures due to hitting bonus every single quarter. You will get bonus in  march,  January   If your store makes their numbers.  Get ready to be paid a very low wage very crazy hours and of lot of extra work."
bad,"It’s a very low paying job for the amount of work that is expected to be done. If you absolutely don’t need the money, then it won’t be a factor. Home Depot wants to do more with less. Everyone is only in it to make themselves look good. When you need your managers to back you up, they usually take the side of the store every time. There is no such thing as good leadership. You can only take from the good and throw away the rest. Very two-faced when it comes to what actually needs to be done vs what management wants you to do. True partnerships with the stores are pretty much nonexistent. It’s always “do me a favor” instead of “how can I assist”. It’s very hard to advance your career (if you plan on staying), the only way to move up is to wait until someone in leadership leaves or go store side. No one thinks to train you as a future leader in the company, but instead they barely train you to perform your daily tasks. They want you to act the part without knowing how to be the part. I’ve told my manager that I needed more training but the response was I was already properly trained or to be sent to a different district to train with another supervisor. It is the managers job to train all new supervisors but they insist on delegating their authority. This company tries to brainwash you with the core values that very few people actually believe in. Besides the few things I listed in the “Pros” box, there’s really nothing else this company is good for. If you like next to nothing pay, hard labor, no career potential and poor leadership. Then you’ll do just fine with working here."
bad,Unless you’re in management you really need an additional job to pay bills. Lots of pressure from management to have customers apply for credit. Management does not have the employees best interest at heart.
bad,"There is not enough time during a shift in a busy department to get all of the work done that is expected of any normal human being. "
bad,"no one is motivated, everyone hates their work, and t"
bad,"way underpaid for the amount of work we put. make you work 3 departments."
bad,Home depot was a good company but there management is horrible. The take the words of he said stuff and hold it against work performance.  If you don't fall within their click you will not last.
bad,"First of all. I wasted 10 years at this company, I worked at many different stores. I was a supervisor for 6 years. Don't waste your time with this company if you want a rewarding job that compensates you with reasonable wages. Management is terrible, they may be nice human beings, but I've only met a few that actually even try to do a decent job. Don't do what I did. Use this place as a stepping stone only!"
bad,"Don't work here, it is not a good working enviorment. Too much drama between the own workers. Very bad place to work at and i would never recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"Home Depot is a very busy place, stressful places to work for. Home Depot doesn't give you a chance to grow within. Home Depot have lot's of  favoritism within employees."
bad,"Great place to work. Decent working environment, although it gets a little loud in some of the places...just bring headphones. Lots of interesting projects to get involved with."
bad,I was a valued employee had a set scheduled work hard to create a loyal fan base with customers worked well with other people was looked upon as a leader
bad,"The management was terrible to the point I dreaded coming in for only a four hour shift because of my department head, things go broken without repair for weeks sometimes months at a time. But the worst part is the clics and groups of employees where people gossip about each other like it's still high school. The only thing that makes the job bearable is the occasional polite customer. Overall would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Just no ! They have to be the most unorganized company ! So much favoritism! They hired ppl who literally should never be in a  management role! Lost for words with this company !
bad,The company culture is based totally around the bottom line. they could not care less about the employee or the customer if it impacts the profit of the company.
bad,"I expected Home Depot to have a professional work environment, but I was wrong. Management was horrible, they would see associates struggling with their work, and would not offer to help. I was in charge of pushing the shopping carts, and help customers load their vehicles. I used to load 90lb of cement into customers vehicles with no help. I would call management for help, but they never came to help, or send someone to help."
bad,They helped me through all my medical problems and helped teached me new things and help switch me to different departments. They do some charity work for the community.
bad,"Management was inconsistent and didn't truly care for the employees. Most were quick tempered and really didn't listen to the employees if there was an issue, and decided to blame the employee regardless."
bad,"understaffed, overworked,underpaid. It used to be great but as corporations go the bigger they get the greedier the higher ups get. They cut man hours and started demanding more from the few people left."
bad,I would not recommend them because management plays favorites which makes it hard for deserving associates to earn career advancements. The hourly pay may be good but if you are part time and do not get good hrs it won't help financially. Also they say they are 100% family oriented but they are not. If you work there you will see over time. The high turnover rate is due to poor management amongst other things.
bad,"installations of several jobs per day, payment is very difficult to receive,clients not getting response from customer service in a timely fashion, very difficult to deal with product arrival times"
bad,I don’t reccomend working for the Home Depot especially in the lumber and garden department. The amount of labor you have to do is not worth the pay. They draw you in by saying the have amazing benefits And can do all these things for you and then when a real problem comes up instead of offering to help they will just fire you. At least this is the experience I had at my store. I’ve seen several people get fired or have their job threatened because they had a problem in the family hand had to call out a day or two. I’ve never seen such a high turnover rate at any place I have worked. The management is terrible they all just use their power to control everyone and they don’t listen when their employees actually need help and they don’t work with your schedule. Over all from my expirience they care more about how much money they can make than they do their accosiates.
bad,"I was referred to this job and couldn't have regretted it more. If you do not work a day shift at this company you will Never advance. Senior management puts on a perfect face when you first meet them. However, they treat the different shifts unequally. I couldn't tolerate working for a company that promoted based off of ""who you know""  instead of ability to do the job well, ecceeding job duties or skill set. Unless you are someone who can become a a brown noser don't expect to advance. Night support for information, escalated calls, etc was also ""broken"" or you received push back before calls were taken. You were lucky if there was an agent available at all. Instead of fixing the problem they only asked for reports when it happened. I couldn't handle the stress anymore so I left."
bad,They micromanaged to the point where it makes it a stressful place to work and it affects your overall judgement because their is someone watching you at all times
bad,worst place I ever worked for. They don't want you to grow. If you are not friends with management you will never get promoted. this place is only for temporary high school kids.
bad,Okay job while you looking for something better.  Good benefit package and is main reason employees stay.  Does not include store discounts.  Pay is minimum.  Raises are annual and usually in the 5 to 10 cent an hour range.
bad,Home Depot is a great place to work while attending school. They offer great benefits for full time associates. They do not offer very many full time positions. Part time associates usually work between 8-24 hours a week.
bad,Home depot has lost it's mark as one of the leading retail stores for construction materials.  I need to go back to it's family environment of treating it's employee's. At this moment I would not recommend any adult to work here.  This company is for young college students. Not those that actually know about the home improvement industry.
bad,"Homedepot wasn't super terrible but it certainly was not a pleasant experience. I worked as a cashier but due to my discomfort I switched to a lot associate and let me tell you they treated us like animals. No one gave respect to us and there was constant back talk amongst coworkers as well as managers. There definitely was favorites involved, while cashiers who take a long time ringing up customers and gossiped with whomever they wanted to, got rewarded with raises and ""homer badges"" the people like me who work hard going back and forth, lifting, unloading, helping cashiers, managers, as well as anyone else who would ask for assistance, we received not ONE reward. I worked too hard for this company and since I only focused on my JOB I found it ill mannered that I as well as the rest of the lot associates remained in the dust. Unforgivable what they did to my hours, so, I left, I had enough."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me jumping from department to department because there was too many call outs, or people didn't answer their phones. The management team I felt like I couldn't trust. I also had way too much on my workload. They considered me a supervisor and I did the job role of one but they wouldn't give me the title of one, everytime I went out for a supervisor position I always had something wrong with me. So I got tired of them taking advantage of me and left."
bad,"Fear...on a daily basis of losing your job.  Negativity...never doing it right.  Bullying...coworkers who constantly make you feel unwelcome.  You're ever only one complaint away from potentially losing your job.  Make sure to always have someone around who can back you up.  Questions are unwelcome...not only will coworkers refuse to help you and ""throw you under the bus"" given the chance, management does not come to your aid or defend you, and you will fall before they will!  Half the time they don't know the answer...so how can they come to help you without looking the fool themselves.  Management has no management talent - no real idea of how to manage or lead.  Respect is something they attempt to scare you into; it is not a value that is earned nor the result of any leadership talent.  Conversely, the company culture and core values I admire, but I did not experience them practiced or promoted.  Had great expectations and really wanted the job...completely disappointed!"
bad,"it was... a journey. breaks were given out whenever the head cashier of the day felt like it. anyone working outside in the garden area are supposed to be given a steady supply of water to avoid dehydration, but the water cooler was always empty, and if you asked management for more water they'd cut your hours. "
bad,"The people that work at Home Depot are nice but there is no management plan to promote people or even move people off part time. They view employees as disposable/replaceable. You don't like it quit, try and organize a union we will fire you."
bad,It was a joke getting commission only and the sales management sits there and reeps on your benifits. There are some real winners running that show and when US Remodelers went away the end
bad,My experience at Home Depot started off nice then it got rough and stressful.Management is not all that great do you have a few people that do the right thing but not everyone
bad,A typical day at Home Depot Super Store for me is usually working by myself trying to find the proper help that I need and getting accused of things I’ve learned that it a real crazy world out here and bad things happen to good people I’ve learned management really doesn’t not even a little bit the workplace culture are mainly from the Caribbean Islands the hardest part of the job is to have Associate focus on there job stop lying and mind there business the enjoyable part of the job is clocking out after everything
bad,"Long time employee, was a department supervisor. was looking to get promoted but no positions available, that was okay. Managers hide in there offices and only come out when the manager walks with them. The store manager needs some training, at an all store meeting he let be known that a deceased associate had a drinking problem. He thought this was funny. Thats one big reason why I left."
bad,"Never question your supervisors, or management because they will lose it wondering how you could ever  have a mind of your own to question their authority. If you're part time then you receive no more than 27 hours a week, and minimal pay ($9-11 per hour starting). If you want a second part time job this will over work you for every hour you put in. The shift schedule is inconsistent, and if you want to get certified for the forklifts you'll be waiting for months. You will constantly be under pressure to finish large work loads with people who don't want to get the work done and expect someone else to do it. You get 15 minutes for breaks after two hours, 30 minutes lunch. You will always be over worked, people always call out, you'll learn to hate working in tile, lumber, and grill sections. It's a perfect job for high school students."
bad,"A typical day started at 7 or 8 o'clock to make it to my first appointment as many as 2 hours drive away.  Visiting clients/leads in their home, measuring and presenting the product to the customer.  An appointment takes 90 minutes which is longer than most clients expect so be prepared to overcome that issue.  I arrived back home somewhere between 5 and 10PM.  You buy your own tools and drive your own car but are reimbursed at a fair rate for your miles.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day.  The hardest part of the job is managing the sales you close to ensure that they are completed to the customer's satisfaction.  Frankly this job works out well in densely populated areas with high median income.  I was hired by a negligent manager in an area that couldn't support a full time sales consultant.  After my manager was fired my new manager was far more competent but the issue could not be resolved so I resigned.  You need to have enough savings to survive 3-5 months with little income for this job.  The full commission is not paid until the job is installed and for roof installs this can be 7+ months.  The company moves faster than its own good with the ipad technology, causing unnecessary communication gaps and frustration for customers.  The most recent move was to shift to salesforce which will have you checking your ipad like a jealous ex checks their friends requests."
bad,High expectations and very low pay. Not worth it because management is very rude and aren't taught how to properly speak to associates. Also for driving a forklift they don't pay you not even a penny more.
bad,Working as a freight team member is the hardest job in the building the overnight department head is a horrible manager who only wants to deal with throwing trash away instead of managing the people that work for him. Then when he gets in trouble he throws the people that work for him under the bus no matter how hard they work. I'm sure as a cashier or anywhere else in the building it would be fun to work but working under mat on the overnight Freight team is horrible with horrible management.
bad,"Over worked, unappreciated, underpaid, management is horrible, don't care and mistreat employees. They do not care about you they work when and only on walks."
bad,Over worked for the pay. Your all is never good enough. Always want more.  Management is never satisfied.   Had to get time off. Most enjoyable  part is time goes by fast.
bad,As a merchandiser the schedule is perfect the paid time off is perfect. but the pay is horrible. Pay on store side is horrible too. Can not afford much of anything on this paycheck. Get a check every two weeks. Not helpful. If you are a young teenager or a retired person I would recommend working at Home Depot.
bad,Management is the worse. Never trust a word they say. DH will plot together with ASM and management against store associates. It's a back stabbing big box store with a big turn over.
bad,"No opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Revolving door on administration. Workload is given out with favoritism, not seniority. Paycheck and promises were made to start. Two years in it starts to fade away. Work load dropped off. regional work does not pay."
bad,"It was a competitive specialty sales environment where it seemed as if the sales floor wasn't appropriately covered with enough associates causing customers to become frustrated..  In addition, many associates are not educated as to product info and therefore have difficulty in providing customer assistance.  Nice merchandise. You have to be a problem solver and able to think on your feet since few associates are versed in helping as many are part time.  The pleasant part is that it was creative and offered opportunity to problem solve. Work day usually goes by quickly."
bad,I'm sorry I don't have anything good to say about Home Depot. I would rather not say anything at all. I'm sorry. They have free coffee that's no good.
bad,"Situations arose that required management attention but was pushed off to lower untrained workers. Management failed to recognize issues in customer situations, assistance to customers and customer assistance desk."
bad,They pay you minimum wage for all positions unless you're management. the hours of work are unbearable. They're very cut throat if you mess up. They dont respect you.
bad,"Poor management, Lack of general respect for employees, Lack of safe operation, Negative outlooks, Constant harassment, Favoritism throughout management"
bad,nothing to say. not the place for me. pay is not what people think in working at the home depot. its a very high turn over rate. people don't last long here. the only people that says here are retied folks that don't have anything to do.
bad,Management socks. Can't actually say they even know what their job really is. Hours are off the wall. Part time pay but full time hours. Useless getting trained on things you know nothing about you are to already know. Some management is good but a few don't have a backbone. REALLY PLAY FAVORITES.  Be careful they will definitely use you. 2 1/2 months in and you will get let go and they won't even give a reason. Saw many get axed just because.
bad,"A day at Home Depot was some days stressful, I learned how to be more patience m management was ok, the best part of working here was the hour its ok,"
bad,The was the stores are set up is if you dont work for free they will not promote u higher than supervisor. They will string you along as long as they can use u for free work.
bad,Not enough management on the floor late night shift. Customer gets mad and wants someone fired they throw the employee under the buss to make on pathetic customer haappy
bad,"Constantly being understaffed created a very stressful environment, thus unable to properly take care of customers' needs and expectations. Lack of respect from the upper management compounded the situation."
bad,I am an employee at HD and I wouldn't recommend the job to anyone I know. I'm not sure how it is at other HD's but the one I currently work at is terrible as far as the work they want you to do and the terrible pay and unfair favoritism.
bad,Working culture at The Home Depot is that people do not take responsibility for their area.  Pay does not match responsibility as we are overworked.  Management allows customers to talk down and degrade you as an associate.
bad,"Working at the home depot taught me how to work in a fast paste environment, and that hard work can be very rewarding. The part of the job I felt most difficult was making my percentage."
bad,"No hours and they dont care about the health of the workers.  We only worked 15 hrs max so therefore it makes it almost impossible to get health care. Management just wants to sell sell sell, then we get the worlds smallest bonus check after selling 1 million sells a year."
bad,"Would walk in door and before you can even hang your coat up, all you hear is complaints from fellow colleagues on how busy they are and no support from management"
bad,answering about 200 calls a day. Checking placing orders. Dealing with customers attitudes. Dealing with the lack of professionalism from fellow coworker.
bad,"Poor management. Customers are rude. They will work you until you have no more strength in you. Its a fast paced environment, where you have to put up a fake smile and take orders from demanding people (managers and customers). Its a stressful environment due to lack of management skills, lazy employees, and customers who are demanding."
bad,Poor management poor team work poor pay poor consistent Not always there for u poor all around leadership not willing to work with you in desperate times
bad,Home depot was a very fast paced job and it was physically draining. I would like to compare this job to some sort of laborers or construction job. I was lifting non-stop bags of mulch all day in the summer heat with little breaks.
bad,"i worked here for a week but it felt like 100 years. the work was beyond slow paced and it felt like you were going out of your mind, I wanted to cry on a daily basis. the met supervisor was awesome that was the only good thing. the pay was miserably low and not worth it. I strongly suggest if you are looking for a good job that you don't work here."
bad,Didn't have a good time at all was very bad training and never listens to my availability. Was not s good experience and I recommend finding differnt employment
bad,"Very much a double standard when it comes to management and the common folks.  Observed them coming and going as they please, but gave others warnings and ocurances for absences and tardies."
bad,"I only recommend this job for kids that just graduated high school, and if you are not paying bills, When I started working in this company I was very enthusiastic, but the time has passed by and you realize that the people that work with you are lazy, and do not help you. the training is bad they expect you to learn everything on the computer. no communications between managers"
bad,The management team will not help any associate but send another lower manager to do the task. The team will also not fire any associate till it is in their time.
bad,"Not great cut hours to 16.  Had to struggle for awhile due to it, let job for better paying due to not having enough for only one manger will work with you there"
bad,There is a pervading attitude of every man for themselves. The concept of teamwork is never observed. The company fosters a pure reactive outlook. there is no accountability.
bad,"Home depot is all  about who you know,not enough coverage, when stuck in postion its hard to move up higher,Great for collage student to work at, learned a lot the hardest part is no coverage, no support. store manager is not friendly only helps when they have walks coming up.The managers are very rude, stuck up"
bad,"Understaffed with no effort to make working there appealing. "
bad,"The company as a whole has a plan that is beneficial, but the facility that I work at does not embody those principles. It is stressful and poorly managed. There is little or no advancement, and no cohesiveness in management."
bad,"I recently left this company. I worked at the location in Brandon Ms."
bad,Everyone who works here was cut throat. They did not care for employees they just wanted everyone to work overtime and not have a good work life balance.
bad,"Please I cannot express the importance of shopping at private retailers Home depot Does not need every one  money. For the item most commonly needed such as storage,cleaning,paint,tools. Please take your business elsewhere."
bad,"It was always clear the managers and head cashiers had favorites and gave benefits to those who they were friends with more opportunities. I was aware a new employee, someone who hadn't been with us for more than two months, and came after I was hired to suddenly be promoted and trained to be head cashier. The same person who didn't come to work on five occasions without calling or letting anyone know."
bad,"The company lives on lies, all the leads are not qualified leads, you are required to go one leg calls and work at the store as an associate  20 plus hours a week with no pay. And it is strictly commission and some calls are over 100 miles away well out of your promised area"
bad,"A typical day at work is usually, you'll walk in and clock in and you'll have management harassing you. I would defiantly get the job and work task done in a timely matter. I honestly didn't feel my job there at the home depot was secure. I've been working their for 5 years and wasn't giving the full time position that I was promised. I only loved the people that worked there with me. I'm such an people's person get along with everyone especially in the work environment."
bad,Home Depot was a great place to build myself moving up in the company from a cashier to customers service to order pulling and loading the delivery trucks
bad,Home Depot is the worst place I have ever worked. They do not have fair pay and minimal raises. The manager only cared about his pay and his bonuses. It was the most stressful place to work.
bad,"Despite consistently being recognized for my exceptional customer service skills and horticultural knowledge, after the ""rush"" of the spring and summer business, my hours were cut to four hours per week."
bad,Over worked for what you get paid and those who do not do any work get promoted management does not know what they are doing store manager is a joke department heads should all be fired
bad,This was a very stressful place to work. The managers that came in were all about making money and did not care for the needs of their employees. Not a good place to work.
bad,As a Former employee i was able to grow from the bottom all the way till my last position as HR Manager. I was able to meet amazing people with great upbeat attitude and a great sense of urgency.
bad,"everyone pis tranparent. no one family. good money many peopl come and go people are nce in beginning and then ignore oyu, high amoutn of opeople coming and going"
bad,"If you are just a sales associate, it can be tolerable, but any level of management is a headache.  Depending on store management, very confusing and conflicting goals.  Typical Big Box in that corporate has no real clue on what goes on for the typical front line employee."
bad,"Enjoy working with customers.Always eager to learn new products. Multi tasked and provided the best plus 1 customer service."
bad,"Management staff is lacking in good relationship with experienced staff. They don't seem to be able to relate and deal with experience and knowledge in the business. Many loyal customers have decided to go elsewhere for business because of lack of experience and knowledge shown by new associates in the Massena store. It is too bad because customers find it better to deal with associates who are personable and friendly, but that has not been happening especially in the past few months. Maybe higher management should take a long look at what is happening with some of the staff, both associates and management."
bad,"when i interviewed i was told there would be opportunity for full time hours... maybe it was just management at this store, but i never got more than 25 hours in a week."
bad,"It doesn't stand up for u its just pays the bills"
bad,"Just know, everything they tell you in orientation isn't true.... They want production, which management gets bonuses for, but the people doing the actual work do not!!. They lie about the freight needed for the day. They will VTO people, then pile work on you. Management is a joke.... They need to clean house and start over again....."
bad,I came to the store with customer service experience.  Most of my days I was stuck on self check out. I had to go on medical leave . When I returned I was told that was counted against me ultimately costing me a raise
bad,At first it nice to work here. Helping customer is fun but in the long run too much politics and back stabbing.. if they want to get rid of you they will give a hard time so that you will quit and denied all your schedule request.
bad,"Customer servers 100% all the way."
bad,"poor company culture.  Not supportive or encouraging of development.  Does not offer proper training.  Plays ""favorites"", conflicting information, like ""NO OT"", but ""Hurry up and get it done"".  very clique."
bad,"Typical fortune 500 company top heavy bottom disrespected, worst work environment i have had to endure in all my work history. The management has no empathy for the lives of the associates"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of being a doormat. When you're at the bottom of the totem pole...nothing about you really matters. I learned to just be thankful for what I was given; it helps with the bills (some). Management couldn't be any worse I believe. They never help, and complain when they do. They're just there for the money. My co-workers are alright. A lot of gossip, but when you're surrounded by a bunch of women, it's gonna happen. The hardest part of working for Home Depot is resisting the urge to walk out without telling anyone and leaving the customers waiting at your register. The most enjoyable part of working for Home Depot is clocking out and going home to my family."
bad,"Enjoyed day to day bonding with contractors,was good at what I did,but I was stymied by a succession of new supervisors.Turnover rate way too high"
bad,Good job always busy and moving around and learning to do different things good helpful coworkers not enough hours or days giving to work.
bad,No work life balance. Too many factors to achieve success. Big corporate push. 6 days a week. Stable job and benefits. Just too big brother for me.
bad,"I really don't have anything nice to say about Home Depot, except about the customers, I enjoyed talking and getting to know my customers."
bad,the job was seasonal and the amount of pay for the work wasn't subsequential. the people were nice and for july fourth the managment through a party for the employees
bad,There are some amazing people at the Joplin Home Depot and I have truly enjoyed working with some of them. But the management is down right incompetent. They don't have the skills needed to run a business successfully. The HR in this store is pretty terrible as well. Home Depot seems to be a pretty okay company to work for with great benefits and flexibility with your scheduling. But the Joplin store needs some serious help and some change of management.
bad,I use to love working here but when the company split into separate entities the expectations of the people that work inside the company their has fallen way below the bar.
bad,"From the schedule to the low pay to the workload, the worst job I ever had. Wait on customers, follow up on sales, put away stock, get special special orders, answer phone calls, get criticized by the bosses for not doing more is everyday, I have learned to avoid big retail like the plague. Management only cares about cutting costs, even at the expense of customer service. My coworkers are fantastic. The hardest part of the job is trying to decide which crisis to deal with next. The most enjoyable is helping people."
bad,"I spent a lot of time working in other departments due to a lack of staffing/lack of work ethic among co-workers. 70% of the customers were nice people, the other 30%, look out. I was threatened with physical violence AT LEAST once a week. One of my co-workers was drug off a forklift by a very drunk and very upset customer. The store wasn't in a very good neighborhood and management let the customers do whatever they wanted. The hardest part of the job was being cursed at, threatened, followed, and generally berated by the more obnoxious customers. The most enjoyable part was the other customers I was able to help out and make their day."
bad,Management is not a well structured team.  The store manager is never there. UNDERSTAFFED. Turnover rate is extremely high.  My advice STAY AWAY
bad,"Good place to work if your young or have lots of muscle!"
bad,"This Home Depot hires part-time employees and openly confesses this is so that they won't be required to comply with the Affordable Health Care Act. The pay is low, and I am not eligible for any benefits (i.e. health care, 401k, vacation, ect.). Even if I was working 40 hours per week, I would still be in poverty according to the federal poverty guidelines and would still be eligible for welfare assistance from the State. Despite their insistence on putting employees first, it is only lip service. This company cares little for their employees' well being and most for corporate officers' profits and shareholders' dividends."
bad,"I was hired along with 6 other people in march this year. It was my first job I got when I moved to this town after I bought my house. I was under the impression that this job would be great, was I very wrong. This job is great for students or people looking for a second job, but stay away if you have a family or a house. The hours are so horrible through out the week, you would be lucky to get 20 hours (and 20 hours a week is what you need to get their horrible benefits package) "
bad,"Now, i cant say all home depots are the same, but if they were i wouldn't at all be surprised. The management has their favorites you know the people that get their Starbucks for them. It was a horrible working environment and felt like i couldn't really trust anyone especially the management. The customers are very demanding a lot of stealing took place with customers and even employees and the end of my three years, i didn't feel safe. Leaving that job was the best thing i ever did. If you feel like you really need a job because of your situation Work for Home Depot it has amazing benefits that's the only thing positive i can say about Home Depot. Get out of there fast, don't get stuck working for this company."
bad,"IT infrastructure (OSE) department is a chaotic, disorganized, and built on intimidation and escalation. They have no concept of planning. Every incident is an escalation. They call EVERYONE into a ""War Room"" no matter the impact to other projects and work. Resources are stretched extremely thin making project completion challenging. "
bad,"i am a full time employee and still found it difficult to make ends meat. i requested so schedule changes so i could have another job. i was refused my request and told that if i want another job i will neeed to change my status to part time. i feel like there is no point in them asking our availability because they just defecate all over it anyhow. the people i worked with are great and very friendly. upper management is a joke, and what they dont realize is the sales of the store has nothing to with them, if they were all to take a month long vacation, all operations and sales will remain the same."
bad,"Very hard physically and emotionally, management did not appreciate the hard work.  Home Depot just uses people like equipment and then gets rid of people for no good reason.  Hardest part of job was heavy lifting, and dealing with management.  The most enjoyable part was helping nice customers. Most co-workers were good, a typical day was customer service.  I learned people skills."
bad,"Didn't like nothing about the job"
bad,"My Typical day: everyday I have to clean up the lot of carts while and help load concrete bags into trucks."
bad,"worked there for 8 years busting butt day in and day out.  used to work over nights, very rarely got any appreciation for doing all that I did.  co workers for the most part was amazing to work with 98% of management was all about themselves and there was no loyalty to the people that actually did their jobs.  upper management was a joke"
bad,"I enjoyed working here while attending classes because they were very open to accommodating my class times. The management was not very constructive though, and the scheduling was not done very fairly. They choose favorites and then promote them before anyone else that works there."
bad,"I learned a lot from the Home Depot company, about stability and good character, how to maintain a good attitude and how to always keep customers first. The employees were very friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I don't think my job was hard at all, I completed every task exceptionally."
bad,"Co-workers worked well together, The most enjoyable part was when you did have interaction with the customers and provived customer service."
bad,"I work for hd for 14 years and had a clean record but you get on upper managements bad side and 1 little thing...boom, fired!! The company has changed SO much over the years! LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A CAREER STARTER"
bad,If you are not part of the click with management don't expect to get too far here.
bad,"not enough pay, but they want you to break your back. typical day get your cash drawer verify balance and stand at the end of your register until customer was ready. Long hours"
bad,"Typical Day: Starts with way too much work load on one employee in a large/double department. "
bad,I really enjoyed the opportunity.the atmosphere was very pleasurable and relaxing.
bad,"This is a bad company to work for.  As a cashier, I worked the outside garden registers and to help their customers, I completed the Garden Associate Training Program.  But because I wasn't in their computer as a Garden Associate, I didn't get the certificate, the$1.00 an hour raise or even the patch for my efforts. There's a dozen more reasons; I just don't have the time to list them all."
bad,I found Home Depot to be a sub level company with 2 sided values.
bad,expect alot out of you
bad,"A typical day's work is good but it depends in what organization you ar working for. Management in Customer Care needs much imprvement. Some co-workers are great, friendly and helpful when you go into a new position. One of the hardest things that I found out in Customer Care is the problem is management ad not the customer. Most enjoyable part is when you get to go home."
bad,"Management is very poor. It was a man's world and if you were a women you would not get any place in this company. Never any ""at a boys"" always negative never postive. Manager worked around most of the front end cashiers for years and couldn't even tell you anyones name. I loved the people I worked with and they all worked hard but never got any recognition of the management team."
bad,"Closed the doors. Loved selling appliances and was very good at it. The atmosphere was not good as the manager always goofed around the young gals. The work ethic of a lot of people there was not good.I enjoyed talking to customers, telling them about our product. I learned a lot about warranties and quality of appliances. The hardest part for me was the laziness of some of the employees and not do their part of a team effort."
bad,"""Too many chiefs and not enough indians."" More detail work than you can possibly get done in a shift. Frequently, you are the only one in your department. In addition, you are expected to lend support to the neighboring departments."
bad,"Every time my sales quotas were steady, they doubled them...without warning. This caused an automatic reduction in any pay raise."
bad,"I was underemployed and highly promotable, yet store management chose to keep me stifled by over tasking me and giving me redundant projects in an attempt to occupy my ambition. Not a recommended employer for ambitious over achievers. But if you like to stock shelves and wait for 5-7 years you might get a raise and more responsibilities."
bad,"I worked for this company as a Resolution Expediter in the Atlanta GA Customer Care Call Center for 2 miserable years. The same company guidelines, such as the 7 minute company approved grace period don't apply to the associates of this department. When there is company sponsored event offered, the associates in this group are not allowed to attend it. The management team constantly finds erroneous reasons to discipline an associate. Regardless of how well you perform your job, it will NEVER be enough!!! They only offer $0.19 - $0.35 raises each year, so it will take you a full year to get a $1.00 pay increase!!!! This is not a typical call center; it is worse than a typical call center!! The management team treats the associates with no respect and constantly degrades and belittles them. They also tell a lot of lies!! I don't care how desperate you are to get a job, PLEASE DO NOT work in Customer Care at THD!!! Your health will quickly deteriorate."
bad,but you can move up in company after 10 years of putting up with mess
bad,"No hours , low pay , great benefits .          "
bad,"Unless your close friends with management, job security and recognition is poor. It's very hard to be successful here. Would not recommend. Management was awful."
bad,"Most insensitive company I've worked for. Home Depot is NOT a diverse friendly company. "
bad,During my experience at home depot I met some good people as far as customers and associates. I built some good relationships with some. I'm all about customer service and helping others whether it co workers or associates. I was a supervisor the last 6 years of my 12years at being at home depot. Last few years sucked I/we were told we could work our own schedule if needed to but that wasn't the case. I was terminated in the end while others adjusted their schedule accordingly if needed to. Wrongful termination.
bad,"For retail employment, there are better companies. Would not let you use accrued time off due to lack of staff. Employees were terminated for following company policy but customers complained enough. Wages were below other retail jobs in local area."
bad,They make you believe you will always have a job and can advance but you can't. You can work hard pick up extra hours when others call off and you can still possibly lose your job. No stability no real advancement and managers are sneaky and untruthful.
bad,"I loved the people i worked with and enjoyed the work i did. Management on the other hand was consistently lacking skills. The MET side of THD is terrible. No actual belief in the teams, two faced, if something is wrong its always the teams fault. Safety measures are not taken seriously. Definitely a disconnect from Management to Associates. never had a bad interaction with store side, but over the almost 2 years i have been with THD MET have had consistent problems with management even though I am a key member of the team with several licences, and holding the position of new associate coach and V.O.A ."
bad,"The warehouse general managers do a good job of making new hires think they care, but you quickly realize that they really don't. The turnover rate is really high, and they wonder why.  Certainly there are some people who are just lazy and don't want to work, so they quit. But the people who work hard every day are not appreciated."
bad,"a typical day started with stretching then get your paper work and go on your way.sometime superviser stand over you.it wasn't any hard about the job,the superviser made hard.the enjoyable part of the day getting ready to go home."
bad,"i Loved working here! til management was a bunch of idiots and fired me for just marking down items i am not rehire able ever in my life. it's not like i stole money from this company, there was also head cashiers that didn't do there job, there was many times when customers would be rude and they wouldn't do anything about it. One head cashier would also be rude to the employees and management would just  make you write a statement they didn't do anything about it"
bad,They only give 33 cent raises and you start and 11.00 hour vs lowes which is aroun 13 they only care about yeads and measures and driving the online store not how the actual store is doing
bad,i thought working at home depot was going to be good until they always keep firing employees cause they believe the customer is always right and that is not right.
bad,The only thing I liked about working there was that I got out at 2 And had the weekends off thanks to being one the met team. The HR person that does the scheduling will tell you what you want to hear to get you in the door then change your schedule on you to stuff you cant work. Then when you talk to them they say working or else.
bad,Not at all what I expected. Rude Management not helpful at all dictate and bark orders other Department Supervisor the same way rude and lazy. Find somewhere else to apply.
bad,"I worked for the company for nearly 13yrs. Started as an associate in a dept then became an inventory control associate then I joined their merchandising team (MET) as an associate. I worked in 3 different stores, transferring was easy, with each store the same as the last. Their AC systems are disgusting. Every new hire would always get sick their first week, probably because of the bad air. Regarding the work? Well, I was thrown into it to say the least. There are very good teaching videos NOW but back when I joined, there wasn't much. You learn more on the job. Expect to cover several different departments on your shifts because there's never enough coverage. Phone calls are a constant so you better answer them or you'll get into trouble. Don't ever get sick, unless you have accrued time as thatll eventually get you fired."
bad,"The Home Depot is not a friendly working environment, salary does not match the work load, management does not provide a clear directive to tasks and job duties. Hostile work environment from management, fellow employees and customers alike. I've seen good and qualified people get passed over for promotion due to favoritism."
bad,"It was like a cult at times. If you did not buy into their message you were treated like you were nothing to them. They did not answer calls, HR that is. Called about issues with my check and would never get a return call. Nor did they inquire about the messages you would leave. Supervisors would stand around doing nothing all day. Some watched football on their phones during meetings and some would be doing things for their other jobs."
bad,"A day of work for me was chaotic almost 24/7. I worked in customer service, freight, and receiving. In customer service you can expect to handle lots of customers who are either returning product, purchasing product, picking up orders, or renting equipment. It is one of the busiest departments of the store. Working in freight and receiving can also be very fast paced, as some responsibilities include unloading trucks. "
bad,The store is great work in the summer. The minute it starts getting colder outside however you're slowly going to be bled hours until you make absolutely nothing at all.
bad,"Over worked and underpaid is the only two words i can describe working for home depot. This is long term for people that are old and have no future. Young people cannot stay here because its better things to do than be there. management barely cares, or help. Co-workers are either lazy or selfish."
bad,While working for this company I have had my fair share of problems but ultimately I loved my job so much. I woke up everyday excited to help customers with their projects. But I was unfortunately let go because of an issue that wasn't caused by me nor was my fault. I went straight to management about my issue and instead of handling it they fired me and let the co worker stay.
bad,"It was a really hard job , a lot of heavy lifting and standing on your feet all day.I learn how to cut blinds and mix paint.Helping customer who are uncertain about paint or blinds."
bad,"It's extremely dangerous and they put such an emphasis on safety and have so many safety rules that no matter what you do, you are breaking one of their rules. People get hurt ALL the time and don't say anything because they are afraid of losing their jobs. A lot of people had be terminated while I was there due to somewhat minor injuries. They always claim they were injured by violating a safety rule which is what they use to justify the termination. The supervisors act nice to your face and even if you have the highest performance in the warehouse day after day with tons of heavy lifting, loading trucks by hand from floor to ceiling, they will still fire you for the smallest thing if the supervisor doesn't like you. I would never recommend anyone to work here at all, even people who I don't like or are desperate for work. The pay might seem good but other places pay better for less harsh work environments. They treat their temps like garbage as well. They treat them like bottom class people. They will give out free food to their employees but won't include temps, they aren't allowed. I just saw how they treated people and the company cares more about their share holders than their own workers."
bad,Home Depot is hard to work for they are always changing things around to make it better but they just make it worse.Thank want robots to work for them if you are applying for an out side sales job it will be hard to make any money because the leads they give you 85% of the time are junk they tell you to go into the store and get leads but you end up helping customers find things so you end up working for free
bad,It was a okay job you’re really just a number to the Home Depot if you don’t get a 95 or more performance you get fired . A lot of the supervisors and managers have huge egos and careless about the employees.
bad,"My biggest issue was poor training on the job. A trainer was assigned to me but we were not scheduled to work together. If we were, the trainer was so busy, he could not train me. Worked in flooring, which is quite an involved sales job with a lot to learn. Another problem was I had to spend too much time cleaning up after the night stockers that I could not do my job properly. Also, managers on duty were not willing to step in and help, like they proclaimed in orientation. Always short staffed for the amount of customers and work required. It was difficult to give customers the service they deserve."
bad,After learning several departments to help ensure customer service my pay never increased yet new hires were getting paid up to $5.00 more an hour and didn't do 1\2 of what I did.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management is lost and filled with unqualified leadership. Excellent employees are turned into non-motivated workers. Instead of empowering their people and building upon their strengths, they detract and devolve their workers. The atmosphere is oppressive, you're always looking over your shoulder wondering when you'll be reprimanded and threatened with your job which occurred on a daily basis."
bad,The Home Depot is an excellent place to work. They have a friendly environment and nearly all employees have a hard working attitude. I was unfortunate to have a supervisor that was ill equipped for his position.
bad,"Con side management team needs serious overhaul as no one follow their ""Motto"" !!! It's very sad and disheartening and I once used to love working there. Now they are focused on how to make money with less all across the board and it's really affecting the stores especially here in Hawaii where it's already broken to begin with. Not recommended to work for Home depot any more as they have lost their focus of employee customer driven."
bad,It is a good first job for young adults to get a feel for retail work. I learned alot working here but the things you learn are more for field work rather than retail use.
bad,Management was never very friendly. Hated the people who worked there who thought they were better than everyone else. never would recommend working there.
bad,"My experience might be unique, but I was hired into the flooring and blinds department which was notorious for people quitting. I soon found out why. The massive amount of specialty knowledge, heavy lifting, and customer service made it a nightmare. There were only 1 or 2 people working at a time and there was always too much work to do, and it stressed everyone out."
bad,Not a job that I would refer someone who is looking to advance a career.  A second job for extra cash maybe but not really.  I did it because I had to find work fast.
bad,"The Home Depot is no longer the company it claims to be.  Demanding, always wanting more.  High turnover rate because you are disposable.  No ""Bleeding Orange"" like we used to in the earlier days.  They do not practice what they preach nor do they truly value any of their associates."
bad,"unstable boss , uncaring district manager --- high school atmosphere. Totaly unprofessional.  Cant say more with out maybe giving away who I am, so just writing enough stuff so you will let me go."
bad,"Its ok. Long hours, bad scheduling, and bad management. Never allowed to sit, or to great a friend. If you weren't helping a customer at any given time you would be in trouble."
bad,home depot is a good company but you do get enough hours to live in the area you would need two jobs just to make ends meet. and they say that hours are flexible until the hours you can't work dont coniside with them even if you can't work those hours because of school.
bad,The only thing I liked about working at home depot was learning about different tools and home items and how they work and what they are used for inside and outside of homes what I dislike the most was the lack of help from managers and co workers
bad,a typical day would be where i go in and I have a line of people trying to rent machines then i have maybe 2-4 customers complaining to call a manager but when we call a manager they dont listen to the associates just listen to the customer. even when the customer might be incorrect.
bad,"Unfair schedule for all employees and retaliation from management, when an opinion given ignore by management with no positive input as expected in the company."
bad,"Home depot can be a great company if you are a full time employee "
bad,"Good company, Good values Corporately. Store Level- Promotions, Advancement, Raises, and Recognition based more on Friendship, Popularity, and Personal Preference, instead of Experience, or Reward for Hard Work."
bad,"Working extremely hard and not getting paid much . I learned how to operate a fork lift , pallet jack, and use a cherry picker.  The workplace culture negative. The hardest part was being under paid to do extreme hard labor. The enjoyable part was getting a check"
bad,I got to the Home Depot and clock in. Then I would go to the receiving area and look on the board what I have to do that do which is doing kitchen and bath through electrical and pick up all of my trash from every department that I worked in doing freight from the pallet. I also  get garden done. Next I pick up all of the trash  depends what else needs to be done.  Which is about 15-20 pallets.  After that which I get done after lunch time 1 am I get back and then doing garden if I get done with electrical which I do most of the time. By the time I get done with all the pallets in every single department I put up all the overstock. Finally  when all the overstock Is done it is time to go.
bad,"Typical day is very busy, contractors want to get in and out as fast as possible. Real time problem solving a must. Problems happen fast and must be addressed. Culture is all about sales both material and credit cards. Management cares about sales, they are tracked daily. If your not selling to their expectations, they will find a way to replace you. They will ignore you until they find a reason to terminate. It was a much different store 10 years ago. Hardest part, management. Best part, the customers. You get to meet a lot of great people and help them everyday."
bad,"This was a great starting job but after about 3 months everything kinda went downhill they start you off with decent amount of training in the beginning but as the year goes on they leave you to figure it out. Severely understaffed so you could never find a manager when you need one, you ask to be trained on equipment and they put your request at the bottom of the pile and never train you on it, when you do ask for help from someone with more experience they pass you off like a baby to another department saying ill find someone and usually never coming back this was a great job if your into construction and know what your talking about and what part your trying to fix or repair other then that ... good luck on any help from anyone in this store"
bad,"My situation was my wife became ill, I needed certain accommodations I was a transfer to another store the store I came from I was very well respected a customer service All Star a 10-year veteran. I ended up in another store with different responsibilities and different expectations it just didn't work out and I was trying to work it out it just didn't come together I had one problem I made a mistake wasn't like anyone was injured or anything it was just a mistake and they terminated me they knew that I had a sick wife at home and two small children and that this would be unbearable and more of a burden than I could handle. My new responsibility required me to get a forklift license I wasn't that comfortable on that I'd only had it a week and I made a mistake I think they could have retrained me on their terminal and let me keep my job after I'd been there so many years I think they wanted to broom me anyways they were wanting to hire part-timers, no health benefits, hours cut at will."
bad,"They pretend to be a employee friendly company but if you don't live and breath the ""orange life"" you are considered an outsider and will have a target on your back."
bad,The amount of work they expect is so overwhelming. Your phones are ringing nonstop and you are expected to finish reports in a timely manner. You are expected to work like a robot. Not all upper management are bad but some are very difficult to work for. They do offer nice benefits but you really go through a lot to have a job with nice benefits. The amount of stress from this job is not worth it. Over a very long time the raises where very poor. some years no raises at all.
bad,"You don't need a high school diploma to become a manager and that is why their rating is super low. Management only looks after themselves, worked at five different location and they're all the same. Pay is decent. HR isn't much help."
bad,"this was the worse company I ever worked for. From the interview only I should have known: applied for 1 position, offered the choice between 3 during first interview, came back for second interview 2 hours later and was told only cashier was available."
bad,"unprofessional coworkers; poor management; stressful work environment; reported on two different occasions that I was being harassed by coworkers and the issue was never dealt with accordingly, it was pushed aside and ignored."
bad,The chance of advancement coming from a Contractor is very slim. Very Very political but I love what I do and the culture is great tho. It would be awesome to be an associate because the contractors get treated like pure afterthoughts.
bad,"Hated the job."
bad,Home Depot is n it for anyone that wants a career as it is very cut throat and management could care less about your personal life and any problems you may be having...care only about the bottom line
bad,"go from bay to bay stocking shelves, reset bays, seasonally there are resets you do i.e. halloween, thanksgiving. I learned how to drive the fork lift and the order puller.  Management is very laid back but is very disorganized.  They don't treat employees fairly, for example, i make 11.50 an hour and have been there for two and a half years. They hired a new guy on and he is making as much as me and doesn't know how to do anything. This makes me feel as though i don't have to do anything right and ill get paid the same with no consequence.  The hardest part of the job is not going crazy, its mind numbing.  I feel as though i have been dumbed down.  The most enjoyable part is the set schedule and having weekends off."
bad,They make it so hard to get the job then after you get it any two occurrences as in anybody saying any complaints at all no matter what it is like an ex-employer can get you fired. For some of the amount of work and the experience that you need to run equipment the pay is horrible.
bad,Show up to work and did the same thing everyday for ten hours a day. Benefits given after training completed but the lack of being treated like a person instead of property was just too much.
bad,"Management is awful.  They do not care one bit about employees, but just the bottom dollar.  You are a # to them.  The employees are all flunkies of some sort and hate being there.  Zombies in training.  Awful pay, of course, unless you are in management, then you can make upwards of $90k to be useless. HR is a joke too.  Of course they have no employee discounts either, yet throw away MILLIONS of dollars worth of merchandise on a weekly basis.  Why not give flowers or mowers or grills to the needy or let the employees have them at a discount? Nope.  Tax write off.  Corporate waste."
bad,Overall of store is a decent place to work. bad communication skills between associates and managment.Fast paced place to work need energy to keep up.
bad,"I worked a lot in receiving and on the sales floor. I worked as a department manager a while in the Lifestyles department (music, video games, toys, clothing, etc). The best part of the job was the culture and my team. It was a fun place to work as nobody needed to buy anything from us. If they entered our store, it was because they wanted to. The hardest part of the job was trying to move up the management ladder. It wasn't possible to become a store manager unless you relocate."
bad,what you experience is up to the manager unfortunately. If you get a good manager all is good but if you get a bad one you are on your own....
bad,"This job is boring, when you don't have any customers, all youre allowed to do is stand there and twiddle your thumbs. The customers are all old white guys so theyre rude and flirted with me way too much."
bad,"I worked for RLC 8616. The three repair centers are overlooked by Jarrod. Before I was fired while on workers compensation Jarrod had been telling repair associates that if they were not willing to relocate to different parts of the warehouse for the slow season of repair work that they needed to walk out the door l, as they will be released. He said your check says Home Depot, not repair tech, you will work where you are told to work or fired. The job description of a repair tech does not include general warehouse associate, which he is implying that associate should do or will be fired. Jarrod is running the repair division into the ground, he just fired the general manager and is now temporarily running until another is hired. The town hall meetings are ran by Jarrod and a H.R. associate. The town hall meetings should be ran by an outside associate, not the manager of the division that he is running. This is not a job to apply for, as the company will will not suceed under this manager's rule."
bad,Home depot is a good company but bad in pay they pay there employees like bad I wish they would pay there hard working associates good money like the supervisors an managers
bad,"In my 8 months on the job I earned 4 sales excellence awards. I was told my 4 colleagues wit more than 120 months experience between them earned just a total of 2 awards."
bad,"worked for home depot for 19 years, many co-workers I've worked with have been terminated / forced out of the company because of their salary & benefits. Home Depot became an unfair company to work for with Arthur Blank retired for the company. I was making 21.45 per hour which was well owed to me for 19 years of hard work. But the company feels that they can let people let me go and hire 3 associates in my place and pay them pennies. Would not recommend this job to anyone, especially if you are a family first person. The Home Depot value wheel is one big joke. And they do not take care of their associates. AT ALL!"
bad,ive heard other stores are different but my store in hemet ca. hires mainly par time workers. your hours vary from 12 hours a wk to 20 hrs a week. you get paid minimum wage and work very hard for it. that wouldnt bother me except this manager likes to play favorites. Existing tenured employees are passed up for full time positions and brand new hires with no experience or qualifications are promoted to department managers or full time positions. other full time positions are filled in by transfers from other stores. this leaves one feeling underappreciated and hopelessly stuck in a dead end job.
bad,"Lots of computer training. Not really pertinent to the job. Stressful, in my opinion, as I was thrown onto the floor with zero to little knowledge. I didn't get coaching. Manager unhelpful as I had to constantly call to get help. Everyone is too busy to help you.The reason I gave a 5 star for work/life balance is that I was working less than 20 hours a week. Worst job I've ever held. If it was a positive experience, I would be writing about it."
bad,"Home depot does not care about their employees. Management does not work with employees to help them succed they way they try to portray in the beginning when you are first getting hired for example theire are employess who have been there 6 years and still never been offered full tim , you have some new guy who gets all buddy buddy with your manager and he gets full time with 8 months of being there , only to have hie leave 2 months after receiving the full time position for a better job!"
bad,"Management was horrible, lacks any chance of advancement. Pay was horrible, minimum wage for cashiers, and what is even more disappointing is each year you get about a 30 cent raise, and when minimum wage went up they raised my pay to minimum wage but didn't add any of my previous raises to it. Then they hire new cashiers making 1.50 more than me per hour after I've been there for 3 years, asked 3 different managers including assistant manager to let me learn a department other than cash ( all departments make more than cashiers) and they gave me many empty promises. they would not work with you school schedule and you are required at least 4 of 7 days availability that includes weekends. They fire you fi you can't meet that and get other associates to work your shifts. They also stuck me with greeting (which is standing in one spot handing out flyers for 4-9 hours) I greeted for 18-22 hours every single week for 4 months it was horrible.I hated working there so glad I quit, and I hope the depot goes down."
bad,Part-time positions are not worth it. No employee discounts. As a cashier the system in which you are scored on is unreliable and inconsistent.
bad,I really like the people I work with. Supervisor is great. One of the leads is a little more demanding than he should be. Would not recommend if your tring to make a living here
bad,"While the company looks after their associates the management is poorly trained, and expected to give up a consistent schedule to best fit the managers work/life balance."
bad,"I supposedly had another co-worker, didnt see him for hours on end. Some days, more like every day I would be working 5-6 hours straight, NO BREAK. A typical day is falling asleep in your car after you just worked for 5 hours straight due to the manual labor every day."
bad,"I've learned that micromanagement is the backbone of the corporate world. I have nothing more to say, thank you. Being honest will get you fired."
bad,"Their management are not very helpful.not interested in advancing you even though they say they are.I've been here for a year and been told many different ""promises"" for promotion and have not advanced just been used for coverage in departments I have experience in."
bad,"a typical day at work is mild paced and calm, customer that come to my store know what they want and sometimes ask for my help."
bad,Not a fun place to work.  Management doesn't care about the employees.  The only goal is to look out for yourself and make yourself look good to your immediate boss or supervisor.
bad,Lots of different jobs. Fair pay.Get to interact with the customers daily. good training program. Not enough payroll for cashiers.
bad,A typical work day is over whelming at best. The management team does not help at all. They provide sub par instructions for new associates at best. I was with them for 7yrs and watched a sad decline in management and over all company standards. Scheduling is horrible. There is never enough coverage. Long lines cause customers to be irritable and not enough training for cashiers make them unable to deal with customer issues properly.
bad,If you're not friends with your supervisor forget about ever getting hours. I got in a heated argument with my supervisors best friend and I lost my full time and became part time. So if you become part time forget about benefits. Do yourself a favor and work within the store. Unless you wanna risk it. Most of the store hates you because you have a set schedule while everyone doesn't.
bad,"it was ok for the most part nothin too fancy. "
bad,If you are looking for a short term job while you attend school for a summer then home depot is nice. If you are not then i would strongly recommend not attending. The Home depot is strictly run on middlemanagment with associates having to respond one or more department heads and the department heads responding to one or more Assistant store managers which in turn respond to Store managers and they respond to district managers ect. This would not be a big issue if any of them were given agency or communicated with one another. Often the case the management would go back and forth telling associates different task to focus on causing confusion at the work place. There is also the problem that Home Depot is fueled by testosterone leading to all male managers having inflated yet fragile ego's.
bad,"Co-workers were friendly. Managers weren't understanding, and wasn't flexible with employees vacation time, and did not give enough hours to the employees that needed more hours."
bad,"Customer Sales / Service, Tracking Incoming Freight, Unloading freight for inside/outside garden . Helping  associates in different departments as needed. Assembling equipment for customers and"
bad,"A typical day requires patience  cause its involved a multitude of work mostly not of your own to be accomplished in an unrealistic manner without help. What learned is just every aspect of construction business in sales and distribution on your own accord do to the lack of knowledge or understanding by company standards."
bad,"I work 9hr shifts with a 1 hr break.  The people that I work with are diverse and make the hours pass by fast and fun.  The work environment is fun , but management is lacking.  There is no room for advancement.  The higher-ups would rather employ a friend or bring an employee from another store rather than give a current employee a better position.  The current employees are never notified of open positions until they are practically filled and even then you may be beat out by an employee that management brought in from ""their"" store that was their friend.  The most enjoyable part of working at Home Depot are the employees."
bad,"Former employee worked for one year, the team work is great but you work for minimum wage and you learn nothing, management dog you around all your shift, no benefits at all, their benefits package is so poor, get yourself a life and save any efforts or time you waste in this place."
bad,"Management was dishonest and oblivious to the needs of the associates and customers. The pay and the hours were unacceptable. The profit share bonus was a joke. Could not survive financially working here. Thee more responsibility taken the more expected Without compensation. No leadership, no accountability."
bad,"a typical day at work was going to work knowing you didn't have the people to do what was needed and that there was not enough employee's to give great customer servicer. management there was not on the floor to help you ,they was always in the office, the hardest part about the job was doing the right thing for the customers cause you knew you didn't have enough people working, most enjoyable part of the job was making sure you did all you could for everyone "
bad,"A typical day at work started by getting all the floats sent to each till from the vault. From their organized the money into the tills, and opened each register. Followed by morning reports. Then managment would come and give you a list of 5-6 things that needed to be done in a day(from organizing aisles with merchandise to sweeping the lobby out front). Which would then be followed by someone else telling you to do something completely different on that list. Managment for unorganized, and everywhere. Store manager tends to pick ""favorites"""
bad,I take pride in any job that i do however this employer wasnt very rewarding.
bad,"Dealing with men everyday ""customers"" was very difficult they had no sense of manners"
bad,"Home Depot seems like an attractive employer for students but unless you are extremely desperate for a job, do not work for Home Depot. It is good for the first few months and then the reality of it sets in. Home Depot does not care about their associates. Associates are getting punished for things that they are doing right and the managers are taking credit for all of the things that are going right. Any suggestions that are made to management, although they make it at the time seem like that will consider it, is disregarded. I work a 40 hour work week and alot of the time do work more than 40 hours a week but because my availability is not open to close 7 days a week I am considered part time. I don't even get a thank you for working overtime. The only reason why I do that is for the money because I am a student. The only thing that I like about Home Depot is the other associates that I work with. As a supervisor, I get multiple complaints from associates saying that they hate their job. There are always people quitting, alot of the time without notice."
bad,"A typical dayat the home depot is always in chaos. Nothing is ever organized, communication between managers and employees was very poor. Daily tasks that needed to be completed never was done in a timelt matter or not done at all. I learned how to really take manners into my own hands as far as completeing tasks i would try to go over and beyond what was asking of me to make sure that things would not be soo out of place. Co-workers in the work place were always interesting. Some of them would be very supportive and some were helpful and very negative. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the emviroment a positive one when everyone surrounding you is often times negative as well as keeping the customers happy. In the end i became a better person and i'm alot stronger because i was in what it felt like the worst position and overcame most of the trying obstacles."
bad,this was a ok company just depen on the store that you choose to work.
bad,Working with the Department od Education collecting unpaid debts from customers skip tracing calls and etc
bad,I worked extremely hard for Home Depot for the year that I worked there constantly bringing in more business with my customer service I always tried to work my hardest
bad,As a store manager the compensation was great but the work was never ending. I was committed to the company for 15 years but when the senior leadership changed the moral dropped. As a SM you get placed in a store to fix and usually in a broken district with no support from the DM and above. The expectations are high with little to no support from the district team.
bad,"Stressful & Managers are  unprofessional. No1 at HDMS follows  CoreValues. $ is good, but for the stress u have to put up with, the pay is not enough."
bad,"la majorité des employés et de la direction sont racistes. Si tu est d’une autre origine, je te déconseille fortement de travailler dans ce Home Depot. C’est des hypocrites et ils sont irrespectueux. Pire expérience de ma vie, j’ai entendue à plusieurs reprises des propos racistes dans la salle d’employé. Je ne me sentais pas à ma place, j’étais mal à l’aise."
bad,Unreasonable expectations from management and a bad work environment in general. Don't work here.you'll find something better. just keep looking or at the very least don't do night shifts.
bad,"Management was horrible with picking favourites. Will not be likely to return to Home Depot, unless favoritism stops. Had to be out on medical leave, and was still able to get paid. Only perk about working there. They do not offer employee discount, they do not work with school/other job schedules, they over work you and do not acknowledge the good work, only will acknowledge what they do not like about your job performance."
bad,"Commission sales, weeks I went without pay, job put me in debt. Poor training. I worked at first in the store and loved my job wish I never changed positions."
bad,"If you enjoy standing on your feet, kneeling down constantly, and having your manager complain to you about this and that, even when you're doing your job correctly, then this is the place for you."
bad,Home Depot like most other companies is about making a dollar for the company and growing its stocks and has left it’s appreciation for employees behind wanting them to do more and more and more for the same pay and in the same amount of time which increases company profits and foot traffic but leaves employees physically and mentally exhausted
bad,"Management treats employees with no respect and operate of favorites vs. performance. I have never missed a shift, nor been late in 6 months. I work hard and non-stop, but am given the worst schedules and hours. The hiring manager hires all of her daughter's friends and they get the hours they desire, as well as no consequences for being absent once a week on average."
bad,"The management is very week to the point that they discontinued servicing customers and selling all but one of their services/products."
bad,Store 0528 are not understanding my mother died and they fire me for going back home to North Carolina to be there for her funeral they are not about the workers they are more about the customers
bad,Home depot spouts that they take care of their people and put their customers first however; nothing could be farther from the truth.  Their managers only worry about their bonus and how what you do affects it.  Associates are chastised and put down if they point out the disconnect.
bad,"They basically try to get you to work 6 days in a row over the weekend so they dont have to pay u full time different schedules every week, very unorganized, ok job for a first timer. But as my 1st retail job I couldn't wait to get out and back to an adult job"
bad,"The Home Depot values they espouse mean absolutely nothing. I would rather not.  Just know this company is based on a set of values that mean nothing to the management as long as the bottom dollar is met, the customers mean nothing."
bad,I mean it a good job just a lot expected out of you and it definitely great fit for single parents they have flexibility hours they work with your schedule just don’t be late or do anything crazy respect your homerbucks and don’t abuse your job
bad,"New hires be aware, the pay is below cost of living. So much of the job depends on the department and department head/department supervisor. This is a “old ole boys” company that discriminated based on race and gender. Women tend to only work jobs as cashier or appliance dept. Home Depot’s plan is to just hire part time workers who are either college students or retirees."
bad,"So when working for the Home depot you must be able to multitask , when up for a promotion if someone else wants that position they will tell lies on you so you don't get it .  the job is competitive , the  customers are not taken care of ."
bad,"A worker’s comp claim ended with me being constantly harassed at work. I quit from the anxiety of showing up and knowing that the store managers were going to spend my shift circling me. I didn't feel safe, and I know I am not the first one."
bad,"I was a cashier, lumber associates. delivery coordinator, and overnight freight stocker. they put me on nights and gave me less then 24hrs notice. management is very rude, lazy, and like to hand out write ups."
bad,"It was a fun place to work. I enjoyed the employees as they worked together "
bad,"If you like being overworked,  not unappreciated, underpaid and working around non friendly,  clicky coworker's,  then look no further!, The home depot is for you!"
bad,It used to be a great place to work. Then Bob Nardelli came in. Now you have people working that have no desire to work! All the experts are gone and lazy unmotivated hiders are there!
bad,The Home Depot is an unfair working environment. They don’t listen to availability or when you need time off. They schedule hours outside of the availability you give and then mark on your hiring papers that you said longer. You stand on a hard floor because lumber gets al the bubble mats
bad,That type of job isn’t for people who want to enjoy life so I went somewhere considering the fact that homedepot is a job for retired people who don’t like to sit around and people who are still in school
bad,The people that you work with are really the ones who help you get through the week and really its not hard work at all but its got its great health benefits
bad,I do not like home depot they work you too hard do not pay enough and the management Is not fair at all. they don't give any credit there is one good manger and that Is sam but that's it.
bad,Initially I enjoyed my job.  My first 3 managers were great and did a good job.  The last manager I had was not professional and had a lot of personal issues that bled into his job performance and how he dealt with employment.
bad,Advancement is only for friends or individuals that look good on paper. Low salary. Incentive checks are a welcome bonus but not much to get excited about.
bad,"They do offer benifits but the rates that you pay to have them are astrinomical. You can get a better deal on the health care exchange. You do get sick time 4 hours every month for full time and 2 hours for part time. After a year you get a week vacation. Pay raises are a joke your lucky to get 25 cents a year. Average pay for my position is $10 and hour. They take half your paycheck for your benifits every two weeks. The management don't care what problems you are having they expect you to be there every day, but if they have problems they can miss weeks at a time and take their problems out on you. You do earn sick time and can use it if you call out if you have enough sick time to cover your entire shift it doesn't count as an occurance. If you do not have enough you get an  occurance. You are allowed 3  occurances in a 6 month period. Unless the doctor gave you a note ahead of time that you need time off or you request it ahead of time. If you need time off for a sick child you get an occurance if you have no sick time. They do give you 3 days bearevment  for a death in the family but if you need any more time after that to take care of things that time counts against you. You do get a write up for your occurances after 3 of them. The first one is more of a talking to. Get 3 more  occurances in a 6 month period and it gets put into your personel file. The days you miss and the write ups are supposed to fall off in 6 months from the day they occurred unless you go on LOA then it completely pauses the 6 months while you are out. They don't tell you about that until after the"
bad,"20+ year associate"
bad,"It's a good company, just not treated fairly by management. I love my coworkers and many of the customers that come in daily or weekly. I think I'm just ready to move on to something better and something I can further my education in."
bad,"Most Retail Stores take advantage of payed help.They don't give you hours one needs to even come close to pay any bills. Some argue that these jobs are for the retired, veteran and student status folk, I disagree, there are plenty of single people that need to support themselves."
bad,very difficult people to work with. rude and selfish. never a set schedule. terrible at scheduling. Overstaffed. not enough hours.inconsiderate to personal issues.
bad,"This once was a nice place to work it had some structure before switching management, I feel like they don’t give current employees the opportunity to advance in the career because they don’t want to pay them more."
bad,"Leadership role was very challenging and offered no work life balance. Also, management was very condescending to workers. Not a job fit for those that want coaching and encouraging development."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my work day at The Home Depot was seeing all of the dogs that customers brought with them The home depot allows dogs in the store and that made my work day so much bettter.
bad,We take calls both inbound and outbound through a automatic dialer and sell carpet and flooring. Its kind of hard to take care of a family off of $11 a hour.
bad,I moved up In company from cashier to learning to  e an assistant manager. It was a great company till they changes CEOs to Bob Nardelli. He changed a lot of operations and shortened staff. A lot of customers shopped elsewhere after the changes.
bad,"Good company with good intentions. Branch managers I had lazy, cut throat, liars, manipulated the system, fully operated on who they liked with no reguard to talent."
bad,Helping customers find the items they needed. Rotating stocks and products on the shelf as well as replenishing them. Setting up displays of products and proper signs showing discounts if any.
bad,Management and HR were not supportive. Turnover high on store management. Always prepping for district visit to fill  shelf's under false pretenses...
bad,"poor management, no room for advancing at the job, hours vary too much week to week. staff is very unprofessional. managers slack on the job. customer service workers have to compensate for the managers lack of work and mistakes."
bad,Outside all day. Pushing carts. Lifting all day. Breaks were given but if they wasnt that much work to do. Staff on high horses. Boss didnt care about us.
bad,"Too much work for one position, Supervisor never there.  Minimal support from coworkers.  End of the night never could find a manager to let us out.  Off the clock and had to wait till they were ready."
bad,Every time I call them ever I just went back to from a injury due there lack of there management of put 2 or more workers in lot than just me f there wor
bad,Most people stand around and do nothing. Customers seek assistance yet employes play with their phones and text ignoring customers. Store received one of the worst ratings in the country
bad,Learned to operate numerous lift equipment had to load and unload trailers in timely manner. Part time could never get placed full time due to company budget reduced hours kinda seasonal
bad,"A typical day at home depot was fine."
bad,Home depot was a very good company to work for but to much favoritism. Breaks and lunches were given late and always had to take short ones due to short staff.
bad,Would be a decent job for someone who is just starting to look for jobs. work place is fun and very educational but the environment is very hot with no climate control.
bad,No conviene y por eso hay mucha rotación de personal y una falta y te descuentan $1500 aprox. Y eso no te lo dicen las de RH.
bad,"Directions are majorly inconsistent!!!  One minute you are told to do something one way, the next minute a totally different way!  Do not trust the management in this sector.  Lots of favouritism and gossiping.  The job is extremely demanding both physically and mentally.  Mentally because of so much confusion and contradictions.  Not worth the pay which is very low for the expectations.  Expect to ALWAYS work alone and if you are ever in need of physical help lifting things that state and require a Two Person lift....forget it!  You are told to ""Just get it done as quick as possible""."
bad,"It's terrible that you fire someone after working so hard for this company and loved working for Home Depot, and doing what a supervisor agreed to.  This employee was not trained to work with incoming or outgoing calls.  She was trained with chat and emails.  This company is a terrible place to work!!!!!!  Beware - just fair warning."
bad,"Since being moved over to deliveries, I have the opportunity to move around the store and interact with other departments. This position is busier than the service desk, however you are treated differently. Since coming in the this spot, i feel management treats delivery associates poorly. Constantly talks down as wells as allowing another supervisor to treat them with disrespect and yell at them in front of others instead of discussing matters in private. The hardest part to me is having to pull large orders in a small time frame while receiving no help from others. When asking for help from management  you are ignored and associates avoid you.The one good thing about the position though is making the customer happy and them thanking you, it makes a bad day turn good even after everything that has happened."
bad,Everytime I had a problem I went to HR she was rude and disrespectful to me she had it out for me here there turn over rate was crazy I worked there 1 year and saw over 100 people fired in my department alone bad business
bad,"The job was an easy task, the only issue is the fact that management never wants to hold employees who have worked at the company for a while accountable for their actions. Management is never doing their job, yet when you ask for assistance they get upset. The best part of working at Home Depot was clocking out. The customers were always irritated, but you get used to it after a while."
bad,Overall they would be a great company but are unfair when it comes to giving raises. They don't acknowledge a lot of the hard work that people put in but it seems the lazier you are the more you are rewarded.
bad,Enjoyed organizing and stocking shelves. liked to make sure things were in proper place and product was excessible to customers and neat.
bad,This was a fun job when I was there. I loved to coworkers and atmosphere but the hours offered in the winter was horrible. I went form starting at 8.00 an hour to 11.00 an hour within one and a half months but once winter came there was no time available because I was a top paid employee with not much seniority.
bad,"i work hard and take pride in what i do. it was not recognized, less than decent employees promoted over you. told that if you work too hard you wont get promoted so they can keep strong workers on the lines. not what i was told in interview. new supervisors were hired from outside the company, my supervisor was hired with no knowledge of shipping or pallet build. breaks are short, hours are long"
bad,"I was only hired on for a temporary/seasonal position and hired into the hardware department. I did not know anything about hardware whatsoever going into the job. I was not satisfied whatsoever with the department management and I felt like a nuisance when asking questions - which made me uncomfortable to ask, though it was necessary. A typical workday would be assisting customers with their questions and giving great customer service. We also did ""pack-downs"" which was essentially making sure everything was stocked. The part I enjoyed the most was that I had the freedom to be myself toward the customers. The part I liked the least was that I feel I was not properly trained, nor did I have all the knowledge I would have liked to in order to properly assist the customers."
bad,poor management and promised full time and advancement and had shown I wanted it and got nowhere.treats employee's horribly.
bad,"I worked at The Home Depot for TEN years and worked extremely hard to get promoted. Learned alot of new things and met GREAT people on a daily basis. BUT if you are not a brown nose to the salry management there is NO WAY TO MOVE AHEAD! They have a click of higher management that associates refer to as the ""Good Ole Boys"". They are some of highest of high in management and they ONLY promote within there race NO matter there skill level. This is throughout the state of Texas."
bad,good part time job.  decent pay but good atmosphere.  not a great full time job though
bad,If you don't suck up to the managers you will get fired. They find anything they can to get rid of you.
bad,"A day begins with cleaning the lot and meeting with the early morning contractors. Typically within one to two hours, the store goes from quiet to extremely busy. Our particular store is half the size of other Home Depots and is the busiest, according to number of transactions. We tend to be understaffed, which makes it difficult to meet customer needs, yet we seem to pull it off."
bad,Diversity isn't an issue and you learn new things to do with and within your home.
bad,"Typical day detect and apprehend shoplifters, Did not have a lot of training, Management was approachable, co workers were not really willing to help, Hardest part was learning that I had no support,"
bad,"Good to be fast paced, and people friendly.  Enjoyed the public. Had to learn a lot about home repairs in order to be good help to public. Management did well for the employees."
bad,Typically we unload freight and stock shelves.  I love the physical aspects of my job and I have learned a lot about retailing.  My co-workers are supportive.  The hardest part is lifting and climbing but I am physically fit.  I enjoy assisting the customers.
bad,Was a great a company till the management change and then it closed down for good
bad,"The job is like a typical retail job, some customers will be good, some will be bad."
bad,"Wages paid to hourly associates are quite low.  You have to aggressively negotiate for higher pay BEFORE you are hired.  Pay raises are quite poor and absolutely DO NOT justify all the hard work and dedication you put in.  Their success share program (profit share) is a complete joke.  They always brag about how many millions of dollars the store is making, yet they do not give their associates the proper raises.  You would be extremely ""lucky"" if you got more than a 30-cent raise.  And raises were only given once a year!  It seem most, if not all, store managers and assistant managers are highly INCOMPETENT.  The very poor leadership causes very low morale.  It seems the good managers/assistant managers always end up leaving, which is no surprise.  The company's business practices make absolutely NO SENSE whatsoever. Advancement is very difficult, if not impossible. Work/Life balance is extremely poor.  Thus causing extremely high turnover rate. They implemented a new AUTOMATED system that keeps track of attendance.  So no matter what the reason, you will get penalized. Whether its inclement weather, a car wreck, a death in the family, if you are late or don't show up for work, you are penalized.  Even if you get sick and have a doctor's note, you still get penalized.  You are only allowed 8 or 9 ""infractions"" and after that you are terminated.  The store managers have absolutely no say in the matter.  The managers will usually be understanding, but the company's new automated tracking system is NOT flexible at all.  A coworker was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer and"
bad,"receive freight ,move freight to the floor as needed ,stock product in its bay"
bad,"I enjoyed working with the people. Most of the time, I didn't agree with the CORPORATE POLITICS"
bad,"Work here if you would like to work every dept. , have inconsistent scheduling and want to be underpaid."
bad,"a typical day at work?? watching over your shoulder!! hard work, there usually isn't enough associates there to properly run the store!!! Most associates are covering more than just their department usually 2 or 3!!"
bad,Normally work 8 hour days - different days of the week. Have great co-workers. Enjoy being with associates and customers. My favorite is working with them. the hardest part of the job is planning for events in life with no weekends off and having to work some evenings. Would prefer a set day shift.
bad,"I could say is better than my other job at Burlington, employees are about their job not about you. Love working there but you would expect a better management."
bad,"Worst job Ive ever had! The company spouts out about Ideals they never follow through with. Huge on favoritism regardless of the damage an associate is causing the company. And if you happen to catch on to anything just keep your mouth shut because even though you may think your doing the right thing, to them your not and they will push you out with no problem."
bad,"all it takes is one person to sabotage your career the company has repeatedly let go of people due to age, they will not review allegations of wrong doing, if someone says you did wrong than thats the end of your job."
bad,Hours will vary from day to day. There are time as managers we work 6 days a week and 12 hr plus every day. Work life balance is difficult.  They make a culture that if you call out you will lose your job
bad,"They have poor management skills in my opinion, the people I worked with were great and fun. Managers not so much, we had 4 great reviews as a department and yet criticism was what the team got."
bad,I don't recommend you work here. You get yelled at for talking to your co workers or friends in the lot. They also wouldn't give me the time off when I needed it for school.
bad,Too much drama among employees. I only worked there part time and I’ll never go back. The front end had many lazy workers that complained about everything. Management showed favoritism and the head cashiers were always rude. I just couldn’t adjust with the environment of people that worked there. I’ve been so much better since I left and wouldn’t go back!
bad,Horrible place to work management makes shifts unbearable!!!!!!!!!! Short breaks long hours.Good pay but overall a short term job no advancements within the company.
bad,"As a department head I was NOT trained at all. Just thrown in and literally told ""good luck"". Everytjing I learned I had to figure out by myself, hunting people down and asking them to help me 'when they had the time.' Huge workloads and none of the sales associates have PC privileges to assist in the worlists I was required to give them rendering them useless anyway, so I was expected to do pretty much everything on my own, from working 6 no home bays which freight team fills up as soon as you empty them, finding and homing clearance items,  aministrative work and playing sales associate usually while being scheduled by myself. I have worked in management for 3 years but the workload and amount of time given to you is impossible especially when you're getting called away every 15 minutes to help customers. On top of this I have to work clopens at least 3 times a week making me useless when I get home. Hard to do much on 4 hours of sleep!"
bad,"Don't work for the met team at the truxel road home depot the dem sucks. I transferred there and quickly asked to transfer back to my original store, he had it out for me ever since."
bad,Not sure if it was just my specific Home Depot or not but the management was incredibly unprofessional. This was the most stressful job I've ever worked. There was absolutely no opportunity for job advancement whatsoever unless you were close friends with a manager. Nepotism at it's finest. I will never work at a Home Depot ever again. I will say they at least they prioritize customer satisfaction so shopping as a customer is probably a good experience.
bad,controlling mangement and undecsicive staff get used to constant understaffed work enviroment
bad,"This job does not let you advance unless you are a kissing a managers butt.They work you to the bone, a lot of people actually got really hurt in the 3 years I was there. I got three raises on my annual review one being 15 cents!!!! I hated this job sooo much."
bad,"Lack of respect and recognition for those who actually work, Pressure to perform outweighs any type time to take care of your mental health and your body. Soul crushing"
bad,"I started off as a cashier and moved up to head Cashier. For a year and a half I did not see through the b.s. of the managers. You had many married people hooking up in the back office, men managers only helped the “pretty and party” girls move up, associates being fake when the district manager did walks at the store, and so many other things, people who shouldn’t have been fired got fired and people who didn’t follow safety guidelines were the first ones to move up. This is basically Home Depot High School. At least my store was."
bad,"Use to absolutely love the store - just didn't know much about the overall company/corporation until I began working there. Unless you are easily persuaded, bleed orange and look forward to jumping around like a monkey (desperately trying to impress his master - in hopes of being purchased from an auction block) this place is a no-go!!!."
bad,"Your experience at Home Depot can vary widely depending on where you are placed and who you work with. My first placement was enjoyable enough solely because of my co-workers considering the ability to improve is highly restricted to what seems to be the fear of the current management teams lack of confidence to protect their positions."
bad,I worked there for approximately a year. At that particular location there was a lot of dishonest employees. I also didn't like the atmosphere of working along side fellow employees that gossiped so much and who spent more time talking with each other rather than using their time more productively working.
bad,Working in Asset Protection for Home Depot was challenging and very stressful. I didn't have the management support that I need to be successful at my position.
bad,"Loved the job in the beginning, but by the time i was there for 15 years and put all that time in ,they let me and a few others go , due to down sizing. Very disappointing. it was my career, thought i would retire from there but , thats the way it goes i guess, there is no job security any more."
bad,"Great company but management is not structured and unfair to employees, does not give everyone a chance to become full time or be promoted in the company."
bad,A bunch of associates I worked including myself felt like we were being discriminated against. HR won't do anything. I loved this job till we got a new manager.
bad,"I enjoy my job.  I keep busy each day with new objectives.  I am always learning new things and meeting new people.  Also, me team is a great group of individuals to work beside."
bad,I deal with lazy people and I'm stuck doing all the work by myself. The pay doesn't match the amount of work they expect of you. There is no accountability.
bad,"Horrible Management, great programs, great benefits, great volunteer opportunities, games, food, success share, funding program for associates in need"
bad,"As a company its all about the business and whats best for them ."
bad,"Managing the front end of the store which is the cashiers. Handling money and customers issues. Light to moderate stocking each day and cleaning. Management isn't the best. They do provide food and drinks and do different things for the associates such as badges and awards, Christmas party every year, celebrating major holidays and a bonus check twice a year if sales goal is met."
bad,"I will never work for Home Depot again, and will always tell people I know to stay away from Home Depot.  Pay is low, responsibilities and expectations are far to high for what you are paid.  As an ASM I was making less hourly as a salaried manager than the Lot associates."
bad,"Home Depot used to be a great place to work."
bad,"Hard to grow , when you do its a battle to get there. . I felt beat on trying to get support till I finally left them. I did enjoy some of the people and I would work again this time I would know how to deal with poor management"
bad,There was an associate who repeatedly harassed his female co-wrokers (Including myself) and had formal written complains about him submitted to management but nothing was done.
bad,"depending where you work in the store, oh did I say work? hard to get anyone to do their job. poor customer service in the augusta ,me store. merchandising team was good to work for and great group"
bad,"Fast paced, stressful, extremely hateful people, low pay, terrible management, benefits are alright."
bad,A typical day at home depot was stressful staff was very rude to younger people . company doesn't care about how under-staff you are your fellow employees do not help at all.
bad,"I worked alone, I learned how to cut a lumber as my basic learning. management is really bad, they don't support the new employees.  The work place is actually ok, a lot of mix culture but the hardest part of the job was coming in on my shaft having to clean up after grown menaand the most fun part was helping customer."
bad,Freedom is not a option at homedepot. They do not offer good services to employees and working their employees to the ground. It is not a place for students. It is a bad job. Some management do not care about their employees well being and cause them to suffer.
bad,"They try to act like they are a mom and pop hardware store and nearly everyone that works there seems to be drinking the Kool Aid. The environment is toxic but the environment is toxic. Managers tend to belittle everyone and are never around. 4-5 employees will be covering the stores at night and on many occasions an 18 year old kid with no experience in plumbing or electrical will cover both of those sections,"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the associates, the management don't care unless you are in their click. I learned a lot from this job. I was kind of shy when I started, but as the years go by and you get to know the customer you get relaxed and if you can help the customer then it makes it a great day. The hardest part of the job is have your management back you up .  I love packing down and taking care of the customers and working with a great bunch of people. I learned a lot about this job if you want to move up you can . The raises is bad and not a lot of recognition."
bad,This job is okay for the high schooler trying to make a few bucks but nothing less. Management is greedy and show lots of favoritism. Not easy to be promoted even though you could out work everyone in the store.
bad,"Awful. The expectations are too high. You have to be a security guard. sell their ridiculous credit cards, and make customers do VOC's. A lot of plants are dead in the garden section."
bad,you learned at your own pace. very busy. We had no boss a big turned over in the year I was there. No team work. If you ask for more help your on there red list. big big turn over of employees.
bad,I love working in customer care/ Human resource I enjoy working with a team that always place the customer first and promote a great work environment.
bad,I have nothing to say about  home depot excepted some of the floor supervisor doesn't know how to talk to people and they careless about they workers.
bad,Big business appears to not care about the ones who make the work hapoen. Pay rate was not comparable to work performed. Managers treated employees with dignity and respect. Co workers were a joy to work with. Learned a lot from working with them. Management delegated their responsibilities to someone who really wasn't properly trained to take on the task.
bad,"There are advancement opportunities at Home Depot but their commitment to their employees is ruined by their view that if you aren't willing to work extra hours or if you call out sick you aren't a team player. Everyone is expendable, nobody is recognized for working harder than the next person. Management in particular continually finds small things to note, document, etc., so that they have a reason to write you up or terminate you. Instead of a job in which you are considered valuable you constantly worry about being terminated for an accumulation of small things, while others abandon their job and get rehired or have multiple absences, take long lunches, and do whatever they want. When you express concern they tell you that management is aware of the situation but nothing is done which destroys the morale of the good employees."
bad,"A 100% commission job that is dependent on leads. They encourage/require you to visit with the kitchen design consultants in the stores in your area to have them send in leads. The leads from these consultants are very good. Unfortunately a small percentage of the leads are generated from this source. Most leads are generated by an independent marketing company that pays sales people for leads they can generate in the store. A large number of these leads are not well qualified and are a waste of time and gas. The leads are preset appointments that run 7 days a week. The area sales manager assigns the leads as well as runs leads himself. He knows the source of the lead when it comes in for assignment. Unfortunately I worked for a manager that skimmed the qualified leads that came from in-store kitchen designers as well as many of the Monday though Friday daytime leads. As a result, you will end up working mainly evenings and weekends. The leads are not assigned by territory so you will burn a lot of gas and time getting from one appointment to another if you live in a major metropolitan area."
bad,"This job tends to under staff the entire store, most of management is incompetent, they show up for a store meeting to discuss driving sales, getting credit cards. And then they go off hiding, only appearing to deal with upset customers. They don't offer adequate training, or time to complete your tasks. This location has seen changes in store managers multiple times over the past couple years."
bad,learned to operate forklifts and to be a cashier I worked very hard for homedepot and made 1 mistake no warning or anything and they let me go would not work for that company again
bad,"Nice place if wasn't for the emplyees. Very poor work ethic , some so poor they don't know to keep their hands to their self."
bad,meh. its an entry level job for an entry level life. the people are always good though.
bad,"Overall the work is easy, but the management and the company don't care about their associates. While working at Home Depot in Bowling Green, KY was I was threatened at knife point by a customer. The only thing the upper management did was call the police. They did not ban the man from coming into the store and in fact, he DID come back twice during that week. I was expected to finish my shift despite being emotionally compromised. I was not offered any days off nor was I offered any counselling or support after the incident. The only thing I can say is that my fellow co-workers (NON-MANAGEMENT) consoled me in the days after the incident and made sure that I was comfortable being alone at the cash registers. They checked on me several times during my shifts to make sure that I was alright. "
bad,"Core values of this company are to help customers first. Days consist of organizing and restocking pro desk counter, helping other associates with stocking. Management priorities are to ensure daily time schedule is adhere too. Most co-workers are very friendly and eager to work with each other. The hardest part of this job was to work within the constraints of the time clock and working around those co-workers who did not work to their potential. The most enjoyable part of this job was to help homeowners and contractors achieve a positve outcome of their projects."
bad,I loved working there but couldn’t not move forward with the this company. The temporary service I work for I felt cause this. But it was good work experience.
bad,Easy work takes long time to advance and pay don't go up your replacable the manager is nice but there is 3-4  managers telling you different things to do
bad,"Home Depot is a company that demands a lot for little pay. The company also promotes based off tenure as opposed to quality of work, resulting in the best person often times not selected for promotion."
bad,"My position was eliminated and there was no recourse to be able to have another position despite having openings that would have allowed me a lateral move. I was told I was an excellent worker and they were happy with my performance but still, could not carry on a position for me.  This company is very disorganized by not paying employees on time, not meeting promises, and also disrespectful.  The benefits here are awesome, but sadly the people managing do not live their own values."
bad,"It’s a fun place to work and there are Lots of benefits , perks & discounts. Management is poor they show favoritism when it comes to promotions and Lord forbid one of the decides you’re not their cup of tea . You’ll be out the door for any small thing. They’ve fired a lot of good supervisors and associates bc of this. The pay is shabby compared to most warehouses in the area and raises are skimpy."
bad,It was a place to get by. That is all I have to say about that part of my life. Do not work here if you have a choice to work else where. that is all.
bad,"I work here for a little over a year and only had a manager for 4 months she would repeatedly write people up for things she was supposed to do and never got into trouble for it, she was never in the department and no where to be found. We did not get a new one till last week who has not done trading so she does not know what to do slowing down everyone because we have to retrain another manager and the store manager does not care as long as her numbers look good ."
bad,"I was one of the 3 women who worked on the overnight (9pm-5:30am) Freight Team and our job was to stock product all night, often times re-organizing entire bays and using an electric ladder to stock product onto high shelves, most of the time completely on our own. Due to my physical limitations, I was frequently needing assistance from my direct supervisor and this seemed to bother/annoy him. He told me several times to figure things out myself and leave me to lift very heavy/team lift boxes by myself and would assign difficult tasks to me without anyone to assist. This became a serious problem and when I requested further assistance I was ignored and belittled. I also consistently was on the receiving end of sexist and condescending remarks from my fellow associates."
bad,If you aren’t a favorite you are treated poorly. You’ll never be promoted unless you kiss the butt of the manager in charge of that department. Management could care less about you. “You are expendable we could have you replaced in the hour
bad,"In a typical day, We would deal with so many customers and about 90% of them would have problems that management would have to deal with. we would return items that would weigh a ton and nobody helped to pick up. By far the worst part of working here was the communication, the management didn't respond and caused the workload to pile for the rest of the Reps."
bad,"The store manager is unresponsive to employees request. This store gets hit hard with shrinkage and personally witnessed pressure washers walking straight out of the door, among a myriad of other products, only to be marched back into the store for a refund. Store and District Manager don't seem very passionate about keeping product on the shelves. Turning their backs on external shortage sends a red flag about the level of internal shortage that may be occurring."
bad,They fired and transferred just about everybody in my department then expected deliveries to operate the same without me having help then turn around and keep writing me up for poor performance because deliveries wasn’t being fulfilled due to lack of help. I addressed the problem multiple time and was told that I was complaining
bad,"They hate unions, very punctual about the time you get to work. Do not consider getting injured on the job, they will not have your interests at heart and will do everything in their power to do the minimal at the expense of you having a healthy recovery. Looking more at the dollar signs than the safety of their employees."
bad,"They want you to master and know a lot but have a very poor curriculum for training as well as pay is lacking. If you want a retail job that makes you work hard, than this is the place."
bad,"No set schedule, can't get a second job because your hours change from day to day. If you are part of the click you will be treated okay but if you are not in the click you don't get treated very well. It is just like high school. There is a lot of favouritism. Can't get help when it is need."
bad,"You get the schedule you get and there is no budging. Not a flexible work place in any regard. You think because its Home Depot that you would be paid decently but that is not the case. They push the kool aid hard to get you to drink it. They spew that they care for their employees, but if your a parent and in need a shift change fat chance. The only great part are the people. Management is great too, except they are not able to do anything but escalate. PTO doesn't kick in for 6 months. Its a call center environment so you get the gist."
bad,It was good while it lasted the customers are rude they try to rush you and tell you how to do your job because they are in rush.work on communication
bad,would not recommend appointment center for HDE in marietta. very unorganized with little to no room for advancement. the turn over rate is high even for supervisors and managers
bad,Management is UNFAIR. Hours are INCONSISTENT. You may have 26-32 hours one week & 10-15 the next week. They show favoritism to some employees. I was 8 months pregnant and they would work me outside in 90 degree weather after i told them it was too hot. They do not care. They choose who they want to be nice to and I was not one of those people.
bad,Don't get hurt there are they will treat you horrible afterwards my manager did.I still suffer from my injury years back when I worked there.I won't recommend working there.
bad,"Most of the managers are great, however the supervisors are awful and some of the other employees are just as bad. I do not recommend working here if you would like a stress free and friendly coworker experience."
bad,it was OK if they had more experience manager there to work with and more good leads and control of there staff low pay want you to work all kinds of crazy shift and dont want to pay
bad,Home depot used to be a good place to work until they got too caught up in letting corporate come and make things happen that didn't need to happen.  I wouldn't recommend this place to work for anyone anymore.
bad,"I love the people that work at the Home Depot. But management almost makes it nearly impossible to advance in the company unless you follow the bosses around and do anything and everything they ask. Even at that half of the time when they ask said favors or tasks they are not safe so myself, fellow associates, or customers that come in during the day."
bad,There is lack of promotion and the management favors certain people. Pay is not worth the work the store expects from the associate. It is very fast paced.
bad,"Although some associates/co workers are amazing, it is very hard to work for a company that ignores their employee's concerns/requests.Associates are left to pick up slack. The company itself is an amazing opportunity."
bad,"stay away from this place, if your a teen then its a great place for you to work. its a not a carrer move at all trust me. more like a summer job for a teen"
bad,"I got fired because of bad communication , and they d idnt really care about your life outside of work and that really upset me because I care a lot about my family."
bad,I am a smaller female who worked as a cashier i applied to an open position in hardware after i received sexist and raciest comments from the supervisor many times i brought the issue to higher management and nothing was done i finally complained enough and after proving my knowledge i was hired. After that i always received down grading comments from the supervisor which finally lead me to quite including others...... he still works their
bad,"They don't care about us working, when its pouring down raining or blizzard they want the carts put away.The people they hired doesn't do their job at all."
bad,"Their process is creative but management has little to no experience driving equipment. They come from other companies and have no clue on productivity.  They fire people for weak reasons but if it someone they like they bind backwards for them. If you been there for to long time and can't help the company accordingly, you will be fired or forced to relocate.  Minorities are on a short leash so any mistakes you will be a target."
bad,Unless you are a man this place isn't for you . The store employees treat you bad and the managers allow it.  Everything gets swept under the rug if you make a complaint. Never regretted leaving  .
bad,You help the customers find what they need. You learn that the customer is ALWAYS right even if they're not. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on your own pace.
bad,always room for improvement. the management could be better. they always have fun Fridays and celebrate holidays and provide food which I think is kind.
bad,"Great Job with poor leadership and co-worker cohesiveness. Home Depot is a great company, however they do not provide employees with correct benefits to match workload."
bad,"Co- op placement for high school, gave me retail experience, working with customers helping with questions, knowledge of products, organize shelves, keep stocked up, help bring items and help customers put them into vehicles"
bad,"To be completely honest, the job itself and most of the people you work with (depending on department) are good people and are easy to work with. My problem especially with the store I was located at is that there was ZERO management. I think I saw my manager maybe 5 times total in 6 months. I also had to fix my schedule every week because the HR department obviously had zero regard for your availability. I also was just moved from freight to receiving without a word said to me. For 8 weeks I attempted to have the training put on my learning profile so I could learn how to operate the forklift and other machinery but that was like pulling teeth just to have that done after they asked me if I wanted to be trained on them. After being randomly moved without words being said, my hours were drastically cut by 10 hours and I was never trained on what my ""new"" job was. I had no idea how to do anything and I found myself with no managers around sitting, staring at a computer screen taking tests on process that they dont even use anymore for receiving. Overall probably one of the worst managed companies I have ever worked for."
bad,"This was a temp position"
bad,I loved the people that worked with but the management was horrible... I worked at the service desk I had a lot of responsibility form resolving customers issues to ordering special orders for customers...even though I loved the people I worked with there was a lack of communication
bad,The basis to meet and greet many difference ethical groups of individuals.
bad,"a typical day at work is hectic not enough time to do what you need to. We seem to always be low on workers, and we have to cover multiple departments. I have learned a lot about retail in this job special orders, how to coordinate a delivery, how to drive forklift and the reach. My co workers are great we make a good team. but seems like company does not appreciate the workers very low salary. you can grow in the company but only in responsibilities, not financially. the hardest part of the job is not having enough time to finish your part and having to pass your job to other department workers that don't think is important to get the job done.i really enjoy the part where I can help the customer to finish his project and that I have been able to assist them in there project. helping others brings great satisfaction to me."
bad,Its a normal retail job: assist customers and stock shelves. You can learn a great deal about home repair and home care products. Just like everywhere else management is somewhat detached and plays favorites and your co-workers are normal people trying to pay their bills your relationships with them are only what you invest. Hardest part about this job is dealing with a customer you can not satisfy and the most enjoyable part is applying your experience to help the majority of the customers you will get.
bad,HOme Depot is a great place to work to learn the do's and don'ts of home repairs.  It is also a great place to meet new people with  different professions
bad,To many misunderstandings and communication between Designers and Management. Having a Design area in the middle of a retail Box Store environment will not work the majority of the time. To many interruptions and to noisy when trying to sit with a customer to review and/or discuss there project.
bad,This is a good job for a high school student with no bills to pay.
bad,"The actual work requirements for this job were simple and easy to accomplish, however due to a culture of squeezing every penny they could employees had to complete the job of 3 to 4 people and only get paid as one."
bad,"The job culture is great. Everyone is nice and empathetic. The real problem is management, otherwise known as the delegation task force."
bad,"I really wanted to advance and work  for the company.  The head cashiers at the Duluth MN store are awful and the training  was substandard. We will no longer shop there and will recommend our friends to shop at Menards in Duluth MN. I have 20 years of retail experience. Asked to be put in the garden center for past experience in that. The girl I trained with told me she was going to work there as she could not work after 6. ""I get to water plants and know nothing about them"""
bad,"Good company, good benefits but managment needs more training and know they position. Stop the favoritism and getting over on others."
bad,"I thought this was a great place to work at in the beginning. I took this job because I was unemployed and needed security deposit because I had to move. When hired they knew my situation and said they will help me. I worked there for 4 and a half months when I was told I needed to hurry up and find a new apartment or I would risk being homeless. I went to work the next day and spoke to the manager on duty for another department because my manager wasn’t there and the store manager was in a meeting. I explained that I was trying to request the week off online and wasn’t able to so I came in to speak to someone. Long story short, I explained I had an emergency and needed to take the week off or I’ll be homeless but I don’t want to get fired for it. I was told to do what I have to do and they will let my department manager know. They let me take the week off and when I came back they let me work until the afternoon than called me in the office to tell me I was fired because the store manager couldn’t get in touch with me. I told them my house phone wasn’t working why didn’t they call my cellphone. They didn’t care if I was at risk of being homeless. I believe the only reason I got fired is because of my manager who nobody likes because she talks to you like your a child."
bad,"if you enjoy a high demanding job this company is right for you. You will always be busy, customers, employees and managment will expect 110% out of you and your job performance. If you ever have a good idea most managers will steal your ideas and present it as their own and if it does not go well then they will throw you under the bus. They are a non discrimination company so be prepared, you may be managed by someone with a disability. In my case i left because i was under someone with a mental disability who used those type of excuses to gain her position. She contently ridiculed me and even got in my face, spitting when she talked. when i told higher management she played the disability card and i was at fault. Managers constantly procrastinate and delegate job duties so they do not have to do them to over worked staff. Finally pay is little to known and be ready to scrape by month to month."
bad,"Hine depot is ok, they dont pay enough like lowes. So I dont truly approve of home depot. I prefer lowes over home depot as a work place and the pay rate is definitely better"
bad,"Hays' Home Depot's management team is very poor. They treat their employees with disrespect, and always act above them. They do not treat their employees like they are equals, and do not appreciate their workers. They always point out anything negative, and never praise their workers. This makes it a high level stress job, and you leave every day feeling unappreciated, and unwanted."
bad,Fun place to work with a very relaxed attitude.  Depending on which department you work in there is always plenty of busy work and most of the customers were grateful for your help.
bad,"worked 3 yaers for home depot ,. cleaning ,bathrooms,breakrooms, and showroom floorsplus vall garbage ,parking lots.good manageing staff, and good working conditions"
bad,Stacking wood and cleaning and cutting wood all day           I learned a lot there from cutting wood to different world types and basic things about house works
bad,"My time with the home depot was and interesting its a good company to work for if you have a busy schedule and want good benefits, but after all that no."
bad,"The Home Depot was a fun place to work, except the environment was very toxic. Everyone knew everything about the other, It was honestly like high school all over again. I"
bad,"I took a job as a cashier hoping for the potential to move up to the sales floor. Being a cashier required too much downtime and standing around bored. I like to keep moving and working to stay motivated. My daycare hours are limited to 6:45 everyday and I couldn't work closing shifts, this left me with no opportunity for advancement."
bad,60 hour work week. Long hours. Lots of non HR work. Did not like being there.  Was happy to go. Do not work there if you like HR. What they said the job was .. hmmm
bad,"Manager didn't know what he was doing and treated his employees with disrespect no matter how hard we worked. The job wasnt hard, the hardest part was lfiting heavy items."
bad,The Home Depot is a great and challenging place to work at times. Great place to start out in the home improvement field and building materials in general.
bad,It was an all night job of moving boxes. it was pretty easy it was just messing up how I was sleeping I would barely be able to sleep during the day so at night I would be very tired and non aware.
bad,"May be an excellent place to shop for your project needs but if you are wanting a balanced Personal Life and Career and want to work here better look somewhere else. Getting a fair balanced schedule is like trying to win the lottery. Shifts are long and if you are a closer even worse!"
bad,"Great company but you get looked over a lot of times, a workplace that plays favorites. It is a company that will give you the tools to better develop your skill set and knowledge."
bad,it was a good job very stressful my co workers were really nice and very quick to help you out. it is a job that keeps you on your feet at all hours your getting payed so enjoy your lunch if your working the night shift .
bad,"-Taking calls from all our store associates"
bad,I learned a lot from home depot the managers were okay and the job were really easy the co-workers and I really didn't say much so I really just kept to myself
bad,hard work poor pay 90 percent workers has a partime job or a roommate you will starve if this was your only source of income they only care about warm bodies
bad,Great company but needs to pay more. Good people skills and customer services skills.  Like working for them just need more money.  All in all a great place to work
bad,No respect they just find ways to get rid of you. To many managers management was terrible plant manager was no help at all they want you to keep doing more and more running trying to run more than 1 department then when it was revue time no mention of any raise
bad,"Crummy place to work, not appreciated as an employee.  They just need bodies that's how you are looked at and they are not looking, for people to stay.  Just use you for a season if that."
bad,I have work for them for two years every year you get a raise and for those two years I have only got one raise but the new hires get paid more then me if the starting rate is 14 dollars an hour and I'm getting 13.90 it means nothing. Earlier this year I lost my job benefits no one told me anything about it and when setting it up back the way it was then there was an error in the system I still have no benefits till the next year this should not be the case if I get hurt in any way shape or form I'm not covered do not work here they  will insult you be easily afended and will write you up if you say anything negative towards them
bad,"I requested 5 schedule changes and they denied all of them, had me working when I was supposed to be in school after I told the multiple times when I had school, they did not care"
bad,working at the home depot has been thus far a great experience and very rewarding. It has taught me profoundly and am very humbled to have contributed to the companies overall success.
bad,I didn't enjoy my time working there at all as most the employees that work there don't. it was a place that if you weren't favored then you wouldn't prosper.
bad,Management at Home Depot felt like you were riverworks they were paying you $20 an hour when they were barely paying $10 an hour. Home Depot never gave their employees any discounts on any items and they only give veterans 10% discount on selected items where Lowe's gives 10% discount on all items for veterans
bad,Although workers do most of the work suvari's to get the credit and if the worker said something to the manager about how they're not performing as a manager should they get fired.
bad,"I would never recommend this job to any one,  at least my location, management didbt do anything but complain and make thing hard, I ended up doing everyone's job and they never had any licensed equipment operators on during the times they were needed"
bad,My customers are amazing and I adore them .  :). I spend most of my time answering a multi line phone and transferring calls. The customers are very kind.
bad,"Management at the home Depot I worked at was the worst, terrible scheduling and hard work for such a low pay. Don't recommend to anyone unless you're willing to deal with this for a short period of time."
bad,"Once you get to a point where you make good money, they look for any reason to discipline you. Even if management/hr have to make something up.  I had a good job and excellent performance reviews but new management didn't like me so I was put under a lot of pressure until I cracked!  Mind your p's and q's and trust no one!"
bad,it was a lot of favoritism if you weren't close with the managers it was out of the question to get a new position or even transfer store it was a nightmare working their the managers and the customer treated you like horrible and you would get in trouble for following the rules
bad,I enjoyed my experience at the home depot. It was truly a learning experience working in the flooring department. I am looking forva career that i will learn something new everyday.
bad,I had a non work realted injury and management started treating me very poorly and would often single me out.they was not understanding at all i had to miss a few days of work because pain from a buldging disc in my back and i was written up and given a point even with a Dr. Note.
bad,This particular Home Depot made false accusations of theft on me with no proof at all to show and demanded a confession. I do not recommend this work for anyone!
bad,"Company is good it depends who is the manager and supervisor"
bad,"Poor management. There's no communication and if you do your job well, they expect you to do more and then ask you why you aren't completing the job of 5 people, but never offer pay increases."
bad,"This can be called a necessity performance review and nothing but a review can determine whether you continue employment past contract. the most I received was a position that did not fit my experience where I'd worked in a position handling the money, this is a off course position but not a severed sign of contract, I worked for 8 months past the contract it was not an issue but I found I was removed because of scheduling mistake that lead to management finding the termination option more of a favorable option I however did not find a complaint, I saw most mistakes as I had to radio or management did not pay attention to the functions of a hard working person who stands outside and has to help customers with heavy lifting very often. this position is not recommended and if you are over the age of 50 I suggest you find another job it's a moving sign that this company has no intention of examining age, I noticed when an 80 year old was hired for this position and a wife tried to help while on the clock something they did not take to very lightly and decided to intervene and the management was proactive but the man needed a different job, for those who were younger this job was no issue but it grew to be said several managers paid more attention to the inside of the building but not the outside and tips were offered and received but frowned upon by management I understood no reason for termination I was liked but was not valued this means I returned a customer and saw that tipping was my revenge for the company policy despite the management still there I saw this as the termination"
bad,"Not a bad place to work low pay not engaging, Hot and humid because the air conditioning is limited but they do allow us to use fans. Nice people and managers"
bad,It was a very wrong place for me to learn and grow! I learned nothing. Very easy to work in there! Management was amazing then I winded up having a very unprofessional manager! Manager is very important
bad,"They set you up for failure every way possible,  their raises suck, like 17 cents a year,  they act like they will help you any way that they can but they don't!!"
bad,Worked there for about 3 years went for supervisor more than 3 time.Even trained a supervisor and never got the position it was filled by someone there for about 2 months when I was there about 3.5 years in the same department. A disappointing place to work maybe as a teenager it’s ok. a lot of work for near minimum wage even driving their heavy machines and product knowledge with lots of experience. When it can to raise beat I seen was 15 cents annually.
bad,"The Home Depot is a place for young people, to help around. The company does care much for the employees they fire who ever they want and who ever does move like they want. The is awful the raise is base on reviews and is not much of a big deal. I used to work there for a few years waiting to see if it get better, but thank God I decided to move on. Then a couple of year later I also heard people saying the same thing I’m writing and more detailed. I very sad how big companies like that like to milk out of people and get richer every day instead of pay more to the employees"
bad,I am glad to get away from this place - no schedule is the same - no communication between management and employees at all. Atlanta cant do employees right with payroll - I could go on and on - STAY AWAY
bad,"Working as an order puller at home depot means everyone is your boss and you have to k ow how to do every single person's job and do yours at the exact same time. They run you do death, no never get any credit for anything. Management and also HR management have no heart and want you to put home depot in front of your own health. I almost died and came back to work and they fired me because I called out too many times for health reasons. Never trust management, ever......."
bad,"Stressful work environment from management down to the associates. Drama and pettiness like high school, but with adults. Good pay and benefits, but the negative outweighs the positive."
bad,"the supervisor for the met team will stand behind you all day , no talking to your fellow workers and the dont help the customers . they are the biggest phonies in the country  no matter what they say its all about the bottom line your just a number to them"
bad,"I was hired as a new supervisor. expectations were not properly set for me. I was coached on wearing my apron while standing at the urinal. In the 4 months I was there I never had an actual 1x1 with my manager or any other. The manager that i reported to while in training made more of a physical presence than anything, other than coaching me at the urinal about the apron. At manager and up they preach servant leadership, but do not practice it for anyone other than front line. Supervisors do not trust the managers or senior managers who are very disconnected and the new director was told ""not to break it"" by the previous director when he moved on, but clearly neither knew what was going on with the floor. very poor environment to work in. Everything i have mentioned drives a very high turnover rate with the home depot supervisors, yet they are always shocked when they lose another. they are truly blinded by the thought of their own greatness they cannot see whats in front of them or see feedback as a gift. Rather they see it as you are not assimilating to their culture, therefor you are the problem. "
bad,Either very slow or very fast paced work. The managers don't care about your well being... just the customers. Average cashier gets paid $10 an hour while having to stand all day
bad,"this is very heard job but the other officer make it worth working, if you are not a person that handles pressure well, the job well become very difficult. there are a lot of negative influences that could interfere your productivity"
bad,"Management at my store was horrible! reported a manager to corporate who was refusing to let me file a complaint about another employee for harassment.  After reporting, was treated horribly and manager was bent on making my life miserable. very vindictive and rude. You only get 3 points a year -1 point for being late10 minutes or missing work- and after that you get fired. My last day I had complained to my supervisor about being scheduled anyways after i had been approved to get finals week off, and was told that she made sure i was working and no one would cover it. I was even talked to once by my manager saying that getting my degree shouldn't be as important as being a cashier at home depot! I marched right to the manager and told them them to fire me on the spot seeing i had 3 occurrences anyways and was told to keep working anyways and that they'd fire me later. huh?? DO not work here if you want a living wage or fair treatment. ive been told I was stupid and literally had a supervisor curse at me for asking her to give me cash because my drawer was empty in FRONT of customers. how was it that at our store we as cashiers got paid 10.40 but people on the floor who had worked for years got paid significantly less? And do not get me started on how predatory they were pushing credit on senior citizens and young kids who had no idea how credit worked. No set schedules, unfair pay in accordance to cost of living, and just really dont care about workers at all."
bad,"A typical day at work is lack of communication between upper management and the employees. The workplace culture is very negative.  I would not recommend anyone coming to work for a company like this. I find it stressful to even show up, but yet I have bills to pay.  The hardest part of this job is overlooking all of the OSHA violations going on around me and not being able to say a word about it.  The common goal is not to have employee injuries that can be reported so the food nights won't be taken away.  This is the only incentive we have."
bad,The management isn’t good at this particular location there is favoritism towards female employees making sure all the other employees are willing to kiss up to get them to stay in Home Depot
bad,Horrible job they want to work you like a slave with little pay. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone that I know or even strangers. The only good thing came from this job is that they work with the hours that I needed.
bad,very racist in the north the hours sucked they pretend to care but don't several incidents occurred they just blew them off their main concern is money the upside down pyramid is just a funnel for them to continue giving more money to the big boys and the hourly associates suffer
bad,I begged for a full-time position. Never got it. Lowe's recognized what I had to offer right away and hired me at the top of the pay scale for Sales Specialist immediately.
bad,"I worked for Home depot years ago & just applied & taken part in there job fair. "
bad,I honestly didn't enjoy it the schedule making was not good and the schedule maker didn't work with anyone and make everyone's schedules wrong and I could make some of my shift as they would be scheduled during my school day.
bad,"decent workload and environment. underpaid and working more than my job description "
bad,Their is an extreme lack of communication between floor managers and upper management. When an hourly employee needs an answer the floor manager do not relay message to upper management or flat forget about the hourly employee.
bad,"flexible time, fair pay, nice work environment. would recommend working here for a part time job and some extra pocket change........................."
bad,Manager was on drugs. They ended up firing him. He lied on me for something I didn't do to cover up for another employee they wanted to stay that was related to an employee that works there.
bad,I think they shouldn’t hire people if they doesn’t have hours to give to their employees but they keep hiring part time employees and doesn’t give them enough hours
bad,"A stressful company to work for, they hire people in the company and don't staff enough per shift. Plus they want their employees to cross train in other departments, so they don't have to schedule more people per shift. The pay is not that competitive and the raises are a joke."
bad,"even though we all went through the exact same training, some of my coworkers were so clueless it made doing my job nearly impossible. and even if a lot of them knew what to do, they were too lazy to do it. management did not care about job performance as long as people showed up. Additionally, I was sexually harassed by many customers, to the point that I felt unsafe leaving work alone. Even though I told management, they did not make my work environment any safer."
bad,I worked really hard for this company and I really enjoyed what I did. I did not enjoy the overall work environment at all. this is a job where people are overworked and underpaid.
bad,"People are great customers, not so much. Managers pick who goes far if you play the game. They make life a living nightmare if you are not in the clique, its really sad."
bad,I have no review for this company. It was a job I needed 14 years ago and it has run its course. It is time for a new job with larger career advancement.
bad,This was a poorly paying job that made promises they didn't keep. They passed up good associates when it came to promotions in many departments. I for one trained three associates who then got the promotion I was promised.
bad,this place is an awful place to work for.. When you first start working there they were nice and great.. but when it comes to having children and any form or emergency happens with them they do not care about it what so ever... I would NEVER recommend working here to anyone EVER
bad,There were to many people in charge of the daily work routine. Mangers had to need to show who was in charge and would talk to you any type of way.....
bad,the company used to be a great company to work for... now they've cut hours and treat the people who have been there for years horribly and don't care to help them when they dissolve their department
bad,"They requires us to meet sales goals, while creating tension and competitiveness within each department. They offer bonuses but the same individuals received them."
bad,Terrible place to work. Promotions go to idiots who dont know how to do their jobs and the bottom employees get screwed over and work the hardest. Avoid retail altogether folks.
bad,I would start my day by going to the registers after I clocked in. I would check out customers items. I would promote credits and open up some credit accounts for some customers.
bad,"a typical day at work would consist of being sexually harassed by customers and management not doing anything about it. I learned the home depot is a corrupt place to work. management was awful, they did nothing to help you in difficult situations or to help you succeed. every employee was to busy gossiping to do there jpob correctly."
bad,"I watched the other cashier's bicker. Throw racist comments to other cashiers. Talking about the presidential election. Overall they stood around doing nothing until someone of a higher position came towards their area. Sometimes even supervisors would stand around doing nothing along with them. Pay was wack. Hours were little to none, literally. No chance to be full-time. Load of garbage. DO NOT WORK THERE!"
bad,Home Depot was a great place where I had gained my knowledge in Warehouse Distribution. The people working there was always supportive and always got the job done on a timely managed.
bad,"Difficult work environment, difficult hours, poor hourly wage, poor management style, bad hours, too one sided, bad hiring practices, poor inventory control"
bad,"Company expected long hours.  If store was over in hours, management was expected to stay to fill gaps and hourly workers were sent home.  No work/life balance."
bad,The only way you would ever move up is if you had an in with managers. Also the harassment at this place is unbelievable and the worst part is the the HR department chooses to do nothing about it. So if your a woman and you love the unwanted attention of majority married men both fellow employees and customers this is the place for you. Also promotions are only available to those who are friend with management or related to management. It won't matter how much work you put in. Also you love the 10 cent raises they'll give you ever year.
bad,"This is not relevant to current search for employment.  I have changed career paths, and have been a college student for the last year and a half, and looking for position as Coding and Billing specialist."
bad,"Assistant manager was always resting in back,hardly ever came out to deal with customers.  constantly flirting with the service desk women.  Was constantly trying to find ways to fire others"
bad,Was injured on the job and all I received was a talking to for messing up safety record. Let department people go home to save money and freight people had to wait on customers while trying to put out product.
bad,Was told it does not matter the quality of work performed but rather the quantity of time you have been there. That is ultimately what matters for any career advancements.
bad,Don't waste your time applying and if you do please only work for a max of 90 days. If you work for them please let these be a temp job and you have a real job that pays more money.
bad,"Terrible atmosphere and in Maine the upper-level managers look to move along their buddies or ""their guy"" instead of the more qualified individuals.  Overall a terrible experience."
bad,"They lie (at least they did to me) when they say there is a probation period. It's not, it's the total length of your employment unless you happen to be God's gift to Home Depot. After 120 days they cut you loose."
bad,only hires part time so no benefits and bad hours sometimes i was working 12 hours a week  so after a 2 week pay period you would make like 200$ after taxed for 2 weeks i dont know about you but i cant live on 400 a month that doesnt even cover my rent
bad,"did not have much training and the employees were not willing to help until I got a handle on things. enjoyed driving the tractors when I had to bring them in at night,"
bad,Handling payments for merchandise for customers. restocking shelves for hardware and other areas of the store. Management was fair towards employees like myself.
bad,"work you like a dog and pays cheap, give you a lot of hours but they take advantage of you. give you dirt cheap bonuses and they make the job complicated for no reason."
bad,This company has great customer service and poor employee care. It seem as if it is a fraternity that has initiations handed out to the choosen few to become full time.
bad,The trash bin of america.  The managers are essentially walking zombies who feast on human joy.  The employees are sad souls who would rather sacrifice a goat than to help a customer.
bad,"Title says it all, twice I've applied to this company and they state there isn't a position available. They shouldn't state they support Veteran employment."
bad,"It was not a great place to work for, it was boring and you had to sit around waiting for customers and I wasn't allowed to help the customers when needed which was frustrating because I want to help them out"
bad,When I was working at Home depot I stared out working on the lot. As a cart attend then moved to lumer . I work crazy days a crazy hours with bad mangement
bad,"I was working over there as a labor"
bad,I received a call from home depot to come in for an interview. I get there after I took time off work and the loss pervention manager wasnt there. I spoke to the store manager and she didnt have a clue about any interviews being scheduled. I wasted my time and loss a day pay Until this day i still got no response. Horrible company.
bad,I learned working at the home depot that they don't advance the right people. You have to be in a certain group to get what you want. And thats not how jobs are suppose to be.
bad,I enjoyed working for home depot because of the customers. They made it possible for me to go too work everyday. There were times customers came in upset but it didn't bother me because making them happy and satisfied was more important
bad,"You are assigned a department.  However, everyone helps everyone.  I learned as much from customers as I did from the staff. I was hired to be a cashier and found myself in Appliances, Flooring, Electrical and Plumbing.  I even help with gathering up carts."
bad,"pleasant place to work. "
bad,"The sales manager will take all of the good leads. What you have left and close, you'll then have to deal with installers and measurers, if they say you miscalculated then you lose the commission and sometimes a sale will come out of your own pocket (where you'll have to pay for the miscalculations and materials not allocated)."
bad,They don't really care about their employees. They just need a warm body to fill the slot. Hardest working position in the company and also the lowest paying job position.
bad,solo falta valorar mas al personal de aho todo bien y sobre todo el crecimiento
bad,They cut your hours and honestly a monkey could do that job. You have to watch and read all this stuff that is super remedial and honestly redundant. I wouldn't recommend working there ever
bad,"There is a lot of flaws with management, some care while others do not & there is a lack of consistency. A lot of people do not feel appreciated & feel under paid for what's expected of them & what they go through"
bad,"There was no advancement in the company, they would always hire outside of the company never really building a relationship with the associates."
bad,Home Depot does not have enough employees to cover the departments and the associates do everything to avoid the customers.
bad,Working as a slave with a $2.00 reduction in pay that when I started in 2006. I can't live like this. I keep getting paid less and less the more experience I have. This is no way to run a company.
bad,i have so many bad things i could say about that place but i did have good things to but if i had a choice to work there again i wouldn't care what they offered i would refuse
bad,They love to drag you through the interview process telling you you're a 'good fit' only to not hire. Job postings consistently up over and over again tells you something not right with management.
bad,"the employees at the location chicago ridge home depot, which i worked at is very unorganized. There were many workers there that did not do their job and most importantly did not want to do their jobs. I felt that was very unprofessional and i didnt want to be apart of a team that act in that manner."
bad,it was a great place to work. something different and at the same time you get to learn a great deal about home projects that one self can learn and do himself.
bad,POOR LEADERSHIP difficult work with inadequate pay.  mnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsns.  I said it before and ill say it again.  very poor leadership
bad,I would prefer not to include a review about Home Depot. My experience their as an employee towards the end of my career was not very good.
bad,"I work at the customer service desk, helping customers with their daily needs. I also assist in other dept. when needed."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. The employees go unnoticed by the management. More or less get dusted under the rug when applying within the company for a higher position.
bad,The day was always fast paced. Time limits on unloading trucks as well as getting freight to the floor for customers to purchase.  1.2 million in freight weekly that had to be received accurately.  Any discrepencies had to go through vendor first which meant I had to communicate well in writing and verbally.  Management was notified at the end of every associates shift as to completed tasks.  I was in charge of customer returns as far as getting the defective product repaired or replaced.  Always a new problem or event.  Never a dull moment
bad,great workplace but not very good with working with schedules that you need. other then that the people are great coworkers just bad scheduling and hours
bad,Good sites to work at but you have to be apart of their inner circle that way you can get an apartment.  The people who live there are great people.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. People don't know what they are doing and if they do, they do not do the work they are hired for."
bad,"i would  not  tell anybody to go work at home depot  garbage company.  stabb people on the back management is garbage."
bad,"I regular day is helping customers and stocking shelves."
bad,"Demanding, stressful, and low paying. The benefits and co-workers are the only plus side to working here."
bad,I didn't mind this job but did have a lot of bad side to it. The company paid and played a lot of attention to specific employees more than treating others the same way.
bad,A typical day at work consist of completing the morning checklist going to the morning rally. Providing customer service and solving issues throughout the day.
bad,This was one of the worst places I have ever worked.  It is basically a sweat shop and they don't care about anyone.  Avoid this place at all costs.
bad,"Miserable place to work, they don't know what they need or want most of the days. When things go wrong supervisors not even a year old get angry. Place is a Joke and like to brain wash you about how great it is."
bad,"I would open and close my department, delegate tasks to other employees, serviced customers and communicated with fellow employees on how best to help customers. Management was spectacular with a lot of experience and dedication to the employees. I loved the customer service atmosphere and being able to help people and help solve problems."
bad,"The employees and customers make the job worthwhile. The company itself and the way it is run leaves much to be desired. Everyone is paid the same, regardless of knowledge or experience. The more you know, the more they ask of you without any extra compensation. Though most employees are very knowledgeable and deliver excellent customer service, the pay is very low. Would NOT recommend."
bad,"Didn't learn too much; typical days were based off of Common sense. Work environment, Horrible and disgusting. Bad Customer serv. and Help desk ."
bad,"Managers are related and steal merchandise when they work together,I thought working at home depot would be a pleasant experience,instead I found myself asking managers for help not realizing they were family.  I was terminated and did not receive my last check till a month later.  It's no wonder they have a class action lawsuit pending. Stay away from Lancaster,ca home depot! Corp. Should have undercover security work there for a while."
bad,"...fun if your a sales associate, terrible if your a cashier, simple if your a specialty associate. don't ever become a supervisor in a high volume store. not enough time in the day to complete supervisor tasks. unrealistic timeline on work duties. 40 hour workweeks turn into 50 hour workweeks and still isn't sufficient time for a department supervisor. don't get married if your an asm it will end terribly. good place to learn new things although customers are expecting superior knowledge and theirs plenty of training classes to learn whats necessary although, THERE IS STILL NO TIME APPROPRIATED TO COMPLETE YOUR TRAINING. be prepared to fight to take your breaks and lunches on schedule. DONT WORK OVER 5 HOURS STRAIGHT."
bad,Company requires too much of your time to where employees are NOT able to run errands or spend quality time with family if you are full time. People in corporate offices are incompetent.  Home Depot does NOT train their employees well and will alienate them for money
bad,"es una empresa solida con buena organizacion,brinda oportunidades "
bad,"I learned how to work the Special Services Computer System"
bad,not enough hours or pay. schedule will change without notification
bad,Bad experience. Just bad. Not for me they didn't hold up to the value wheel
bad,very little pay due to capitalism all the high ups wanted all the money they would send everyone home when ever it was not busy even though you had 5 hours remaining in your shift
bad,One of the hardest part of my job was the flood of customers at one time.Being the only one in charge and having to take on that task was hard.i had to set up a plan on spot on how i was going to handle every customer in the proper way.Taking one customer one by one letting the next customer know i see them and will be right with them in a moment working at a steady past.
bad,I was a front end supervisor. I was always under staffed. I had to go to dept. to get prices several times daily because dept. were under staffed.
bad,"- typical day at work: to finish everything quickly since management watched the time and speed"
bad,"No more service ,only worried about profits,stopped caring about employees more hours less help"
bad,"the people there are very genuine and pleasant. "
bad,They laid me off before summer ended.  The hours were crazy non constant.  I was never late for work and was one of the few who actually did my job. Sorry company must be crazy turnover cost!
bad,"Bare minimum compensation, terrible working conditions, terrible management. "
bad,"There are really not many things that I have to say about this company.  I believe they have become too big for their britches and is still getting bigger.  I am very greatful to not me working there anymore."
bad,The typical day at work involves great people with a positive attitude that are willing to help you learn more. Management helps to provide this atmosphere by having meetings that keep communication open. The most difficult part of the job is trying to learn where everything is and what items are. The satisfaction of helping customers is the most enjoyable part of the job
bad,"The job itself had good values, but some of the people I worked with didn't."
bad,really wasnt that organized i wasnt there long enough to write a review
bad,you go into work and your co workers is sitting around doing nothing so i have to go get everything straighten out. i learned how to become a good role model and leader to the other employees. the hardest part of the job was to work in the heat.
bad,"they dont fallow the core values that they preach on, theyre all to them self and not the employee."
bad,"the following error occurred:  your review does not quite meet our quality guidelins....common guys, this is not even funny anymore....please reconsider your company policy"
bad,i told homedepot of the problem and they fired both of us because no one in the building would do there job/there was always a new manager and there wasnt one that followed rules.i drove 61 miles every nite to get bullied by someone that was no higher than me
bad,I've been with this company for over 14 years as a part time employee.  The company has gotten very bad in every department short staffed.  a lot of employees call out or just don't show up at all.   very high turn over! the associates don't care about customer service they leave the departments they work in and just won't do the job there job
bad,"The only good thing is you get to talk with the customers and workers. But if you are inside the store doing doors, paint, or Power Tools its not bad at all. But if you are outside in the heat pushing carts, Loading customers merchandise, Lifting Rocks, washers, wood its bad including pushing carts. Ruined my health and life."
bad,Work at the Home Depot for 3 years now it is a stable and secure work environment. My fellow associates are good to work with.
bad,alot of the time not enough hours. besides that home depot often pays a lot of attention to the consumers of the products as well as all the staff involved
bad,management treated us actually pretty fairly got employee of the month me few times while being there. Loved to be able to sit down with customers and explain to them what they need and how to complete job safely and properly.
bad,Good benefits time paid off  its a good environment   The people around there are friendly and lovable you get bonuses they throw parties.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,The store manager is awesome. I loved working for him. Benefits are Great bonus every six months. All the Workers work as team players the freight team was awesome.
bad,Not somewhere you stay at unless you can get into high management soon upon early employment. They don't care about the little guys. Their staffing is horrible because they save money where they can so they under staff to save money vs helping customers and associates.
bad,They were not flexible with the schedule I needed. I am a full time college student and they would schedule me to work late hours and school nights when I asked to work not as late Monday-Thursday.
bad,"homedepot i say is underpaying associates for thing the deal with. managers and workers will take advantage of new employee hires, over working more responsibility than your assigned too."
bad,If you are just wanting to make some money and not make a career out of it then I would recommend this place.  You can give your all and they will not appreciate you. Anything to make them look good meaning the store manager or asm even the dh is ok but trying to get what deserve is hard to get.
bad,This job wasn't hard at all. EASY Money. BUT when that hot weather kicked in... boy it was tough. Being a lot guy means you have to be outside a good 85% of the day.
bad,un dia de trabajo era salir a repartir a los clientes asignados ya sea en la capital o municipios lo que aprendi fue a manejar equipo de corte la gerencia regular los colegas buen ambiente de trabajo lo mas dificil tener simpatia con mi jefe lo que mas me gustaba era trabajar y hacer ejercicio a la vez
bad,I had a very typical day at Home Depot it was never a dull moment and I like that about the job.
bad,"Raises were an insult!!! They would give you an outstanding review then give you a $0.25 an hour raise."
bad,Im trying to write a good review about Homedepot but the site wont let me. Up at the top where you star the overall rating it only lets me put one and I think thats not good if you want to know the real deal about the company.
bad,great place to keep busy and face paced environment team communication is a plus. loved working with other and meeting customers needs and answering any questions they may have.
bad,lots of training for product knowledge and hire good people. took almost a week just in training in the computer for department you are working it befre you can even work out on the floor. very safety orientataed company to work for as well.
bad,home depot(the one i work at at least) sucks. the managers don't care about you especially one person in particular. my supervisor is a word that i cannot use on here. my coworkers are great but its the management thats horrible
bad,"I accepted a position with Home Depot last January as a Kitchen & Bath Designer with the hopes of establishing a career with this company. I had to choose between 3 job offers.A very huge mistake. Management is the proble,not the position. There are a couple great Department  Heads & Assistant Managers. Then you have most of the others. Very unprofessional and abuse their power. I know,I've seen it and experienced it. Then also,don't believe the group at Corporate that is for the Associates will help. They appease you but in the end they back up management. My advise to anyone looking to find a job with Home Depot, don't. This is the worst company I have ever worked at and I have been a;ll over this country."
bad,"Start my day by clocking in at 7:00 then head to the freight department to meet up with the team for the night. Have are 10min discussion then get to it on the truck if we have one that night or not. Everyone was so friendly great group of guys all around. Learned how to Pack down and Pack out, nothing was really too hard about the job, my only problem was getting to and from, which in the end cost me the position."
bad,"I excelled in every job I ever did for Home Depot.  As a department head I earned the privilege and honor of being trusted with the hardest departments of home depot.  Usually the honor involves either Outside Garden Center or Inside Garden center and 5 associates for each department to assist the department head.  Now this was unusual maybe even a one time thing ever... but I was given charge over both Inside and Outside Garden Center with only two associates.  It was simply purest hard work every day and every minute.    A huge mistake happened that I will never forget. "
bad,"Managers and department heads are very clicky, like high school."
bad,Very fast-paced place to work. Management is varied per location. Pusses you to sell and offer company credit cards and credit lines that don't benefit the customer. Not very willing to work with employees.
bad,the management is terrible to be such a great company if you are to good at your job you will never be promoted..
bad,great experience working at home depot. very friendly management staffing they certainly have place for advancement only trouble with my employment was the hour provided
bad,I learned several things working at The Home depot in many departments. Mainly through answering customer questions. The hardest part of the job was finding the product sometimes. Management was awesome and so were my co-workers. I also took lots of safety classes to obtain increase my knowledge in different areas.
bad,"I work on the truck unloading freight for our customers."
bad,"You would only be told what you did wrong by management."
bad,very nice people there loved to help others fin the things that they needed and  doin my job everyone there was a help in hand when I needed them and everone works as a team
bad,"Working at the Home Depot was both interesting and fun , of course they had their down sides but their a great company to work with!! They could change some things around of course, they do overwork the minors and expect a lot but it’s not a problem once you get used to it .I enjoyed helping customers out when it was needing , i loved making them smile and I enjoyed helping them leave with a big smile on their face!!"
bad,"excellent place to work, stayed almost 15 years, looking for new challenges and opportunities. They promote from within, up to store management. excellent compensation package once you make it to department head"
bad,"It's a really good company to work for wouldn't suggest working the service desk though, too many grumpy people and very boring. Great company though."
bad,"-Hardware associate. Responsible for customer service, inventory, and maintaining departments of hardware, lumber, doors and windows, and flooring; expert in merchandising. "
bad,"People with medical conditions should not waste their time working for such a company, don’t believe the proper-gander .working for HD is like being back in high school."
bad,Good and Bad times changed with management. In the end I felt my home life came 2nd to there needs. Very little encouragement on success but beat down for fails. In the beginning did have wonderful manger and a team atmosphere tho. Enjoyed my job then.
bad,My experience SUCKED my manager was the worst! I was trying to go to school while working there and she did all she could to make sure that couldn't happen.  Had a co-worker that was steeling - I told her this was going on - I left the company and yet it took this person taking over $30k before anything was done about it - would think if you worked in the vault and someone told you an employee was steeling you would investigate but my manager hated me so she ignored it. Don't have a baby while there either - they don't allow breast feeding mothers a place to pump - had to go into the public bathroom to do this and dump cause I wasn't bringing that home to a new born baby - NASTY
bad,A typical day is not having enough coverage to support customers or to make sure things are properly ran. The manager is self serving and retaliatory. The customer and employees are good
bad,They will talk up a good game but in the end you wake up empty handed. There is a lot of favoritism and the Pets get all their own way. Most Associates are very sneaky. Be careful.
bad,"After 9 years,  I only made $.45 an hour more than associates who just started.   They want you there every day even if you're sick, and there is no room for advancement."
bad,Store manager she a piece of work. You get almost no hours if your not favorite to HR/mgmt. They watch staff more than thieves. Staff is miserable & call out on payday weekend. Customers lie on staff & managers don't have your back. Promotions forget about if your not in the clique you won't get it.
bad,"Only valued for part timers , cut throat backstabbing for limited hours no advancement and conditions for workers is horriblle"
bad,Underpaid for what they expect.  Way to many managers and not enough associates. Only get overtime when they need you and then make you cut hours later.  Total miscommunication on all levels. Training sucks but most employees are great to work with.  Hours for some of the employees are not family friendly.
bad,"Overall bad experience working there, said they’d give me the hours I wanted ended up working the exact opposite hours I asked for, managers really sucked and didn’t do their part, only nice thing was that I lived right across the street."
bad,"Home Depot es una buena empresa muy humana , tiene el detalle que sus líderes no saben cómo manejarse y o seleccionar a los candidatos para una postulación de algún puesto"
bad,"Its hard to get anywhere if your not part of the gang that goes out to drink after work.  Store manager hardly spoke to me the 3 years I was there."
bad,"Terrible pay, 0 room for advancement, everyone is trying to get promoted so its cut throat but hey at least they have decent benefits although pretty expensive (10% of each check)"
bad,"The job was right for me. I was retired. I wanted to learn about home improvement. I gained a lot of skills with the company. I do not recommend this job on so many levels. If you are looking for ONLY part time work while attending school its good. That is it. They will not work with your schedule even when they keep.you part time after years of working for them and who can live off part time work. You must be at their beck and call which is an unfair work environment.  You will have no life. I loved some of my co workers and my supervisors for teaching me things I really wanted to know.  The complaints are high level amongst employees and the turn over is higher than I've ever seen in my life time of working. Sometimes it is deliberate that they squeeze good workers out. This in return sets up for bad customer service when a buisness constantly has untrained personal on the floor. Just overall bad work ethics on the part of this company. One that states we all must be honest top priority, when they have no honesty within the internal company."
bad,"unprofessional especially the store mangers . They should be having  at minimum a college degree .   Races the store mangers brings his staff with him , hired MOD same his race , the associate if  same of his race he will excuse your mistakes even you did a big mistake makes the store loss thousands dollars, but If not they will cough you and fired you for any simple mistake ."
bad,"I learned how to understand customer needs, help customers find merchandise. Management is difficult to work with. Hardest part of the job is working with customers so everyone is happy. Most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers."
bad,"They got you outselling credit cards , and dealing with angry customers , while doing 3 other tasks at the same time . With the same pay , raises are a joke"
bad,You work hard for others to pull you down and raise themselves up. You get thrown under the bus. Your good work would be recognized by someone else. The other pro asst. Would change my name on my sales to themselves taking credit. I got 4 hours 3x a week for low pay.
bad,Boring place to work. Management is all over the place. Each one will tell you a different way of doing one thing. Overall it was a waste of time working there.
bad,No room for growth. Management do not support or communicate company policies or instructions for employees benefit. Management lack in efforts to motivate or train effectively.
bad,I was very unhappy working at HD for several reasons 1. My supervisor was a perverted masogynist and never got reprimanded. 2. The hours are unreasonably demanding leaving no time for regular life activities 3. No air conditioning and Exposure to harmful chemicals/dust 4. Dirty environment-pigeon and rat feces
bad,Wouldn't recommend this job. The coworkers are messy and talk about you even if you mind your business and stay to yourself. feels like high school all over again.
bad,"Customer service is their #1 priority but, associates DO NOT GET ENOUGH PAY for the amount of work and time they put in so how can the associates give their 100%?? The turnovers are tremendously high. Management is NEVER there to back you up. They let the customers run over their employees and everyone gets paid a measly $11/hr to start, no matter the department you're in.  The stores make ALOT of money daily and they can't and won't take care of their workers by giving them the pay they rightly deserve. FAIR PAY EQUALS DEDICATED ASSOCIATES EQUALS LOWER TURNOVERS EQUALS HAPPIER CUSTOMERS!!! Sad, sad, sad!!!"
bad,Worked there along time and it ruined my relationship. When I need help they didn't. I asked for a raise and they couldn't. How is one supposed to support a family with an unlivable wage. Also they expect to much for little pay.
bad,"long hours and it was boring, the management treated employees with disrespect. there was a high degree of turnover among staff. Employees were often overworked."
bad,No team work. Rules not followed. When you followed the rules team mates criticized you for making them look bad. We were hired to alleviate the customers from restocking to focus on customers.
bad,Working for the Home Depot was ok their was just a few things I didn’t like I loved my customers just didn’t agreed with a couple of my coworkers do to disrespect and gossiping something I don’t tolerate so to stay out of trouble I walked away until it got to physical so I decided to let the job go after I spoke to management.
bad,The culture is not great. Low pay. Cannot afford the benefits. Taking care of our people doesn't exist anymore. I'm embarrassed to work there. The current CEO is ruining company culture.
bad,Supervisor was not a supervisor that empowered his co-workers. Manager was the same way. Consist drama and things that didn't need to happen. Lack of incentive.
bad,Blah............... Home Depot best place to buy your power tools...!!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome customer service and good management.!!! All employees our happy
bad,"Management treats employees likes slaves, managers will cut your lunch or make sure you don't get your break. They threaten your wages, or position when you point out unfair treatment."
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone, The management is poorly run. I was trying to transfer to a store closer to home and the Hr representative never helped me, /she just kept saying on its really hard to get a full time employee transferred I was wrongfully let go for actions that were untrue.."
bad,I was with this company for almost 7 years. I did everything in this store regarding freight team. Management is 2 faced and if they dont like you they will find a way to get rid of you. Dont take over night full time. they will work you the hardest and if you want to leave on your scheduled time they will get mad at you because they want you to leave when everything is finished. Help? no employees around to help. Everyone usually hides in the bathroom or break room and wants to leave earliest. Trust me they dont care about you.
bad,"For starters, my manager made inappropriate jokes all the time and she was reported constantly by multiple people but never was so much as given a slap on the wrist or a warning about her crude behavior. I was severely underpaid for the work and hours I put in, nor did I receive compensation for the injury I got on the job."
bad,"I worked with great people. Every day was a challenge. I didn't exactly have a chance to give a reason why I had two ""no call, no shows."" If I had a chance to prove my point, I would. This job is not giving me enlugh hours to pay all my bills."
bad,I would not work there four communication skills between management and team members Atwood management messed up they blame the team members and said they told them to do this and it never got done so in result the team members lost their job instead of management
bad,"It would be times where I would need help with a customer and I would page for someone and no one will show up and help. Head cashiers would clock the time you would take breaks (15 mins) and lunches (30 or an hour depending on which one you choose), but the head cashiers would take there time going over their break and lunch and when you bring it up to management nothing is being done about it. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is the some people that I worked with and that they would feed you and time and time again. Workplace is always busy and customers would be very rude and obnoxious, including some of the employees there too."
bad,"They are stock constant overstock, no one oversee the items."
bad,My customers and co-workers express a sense of trust and confidence in my daily performance and overall efficiency. I am confident that with my experience I can make a significant contribution to your team.
bad,"I work with Home Depot almost 2 years, and at first, it was fun, then everyone started showing their true colors. Management was horrible, its a cut-throat environment. Many times I came home with so much stress from that place that I developed stress related hives and psoriasis. For the work I did, I was definitely paid below what I should have been paid."
bad,This store had just opened and it was so long ago. Very poorly managed and a massive disclaimer went out with a lot of people during a  harassment issue.
bad,"Working for Home Depot started out as a great experience, until it was time for them to decide if you would become full time or not.  The select the people who they like to stay on as full time and the one who did not get selected, they placed you where they wanted to place you, and changed your hours."
bad,"this company is cut throat, they will pay you nothing to train others while they are paying the ones you train more money than you. i had all OSHA certificates and was still paid less than the ones i trained."
bad,If your a woman forget getting advanced. Unless your in a particular group no chance for advancement. They looked for reasons to not give a pay raise. I hated this job. I worked for 2 years trying to advance and got no where. I was in my dept the longest and was the lowest paid.
bad,"Poor working conditions, Hot or cold, stand and walk on concrete floor all day. Very rigid, not a friendly place to work. Demanding with very unhappy employees who do nothing but gripe about the company all day."
bad,"I was promised a full time position upon transferring and then my hours got cut, also, my manager would let people leave early from their shift and never let me, especially when i had a doctors appointment or a problem at home."
bad,I wouldnt recommend working at Home Depot if you want a dependable career. Its very cut throat and seems like everyone talks behind everyones back. Very high school feel to it. And higher ups dont appreciate their employees who work very hard.
bad,it's an ok place for a quick job .Your co- workers are awesome and help you out a lot. Supervisors but their job on you so they wouldn't have to do much work.
bad,"The break room was enjoyable. there was a television, refrigerator, microwave, couch, tables & chairs. One of the best places to ever be when you are on your break at Home Depot."
bad,"In terms of learning, you're always learning new things that have a lot of value. The biggest pro are your coworkers and fellow associates who are all in the same boat as you. The worst part are the asm and store manager. In the mississauga west location the general store manager is the most hypocritical person on the management team; she acts and preaches caring about fellow associates when most of the time she barely acknowledges you walking down the halls. Pretty much the management team will not help you and you're on your own. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of helping out someone who truly appreciates the help you gave them."
bad,"If this company spent a fraction of the money they spend on advertising on associates it could be good."
bad,THD is a place to start a career not finish. It would be a good first job if I were 15 or at the oldest 20. Advancement is based on who the store manager favors rather than hard work.
bad,"Because this is a retail business, it has a bad rap and this store is not above that. The management did not work well with each other and it trickled down to the people. We on the floor took most of the problems and dealt with them. I would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,"Interiors is the armpit of Home Depot. No base, prices are much higher that if the person made order in store, and no one can get the loans offered. Put all that together and it equals no PAY!"
bad,Interviewer talked to other people doing my drug test lied and said I was disrespectful for texting back my sister who wanted to know where I was innopropriate jokes  in my presence so I suggest don't answer your phone at all wait until  done with interview
bad,"Very closed-minded environment. No room for growth. No benefits at all at my level. Not very many benefits further up the chain. Very ""cliquey"" with a ""know your place"" mindset from management."
bad,"I didn't like that they complained about my hair while other employees had hair, i hated that i couldn't get more hours. The manager was ok, but i've had better managers."
bad,I have mixed emotions about this specialty retailer but overall it was a growing experience in a personal and professional way.  I became part of the Home Depot family the minute I put on the orange apron. I   learned many things about merchandising and sales and overall running of a huge retail store. It was lots of fun.
bad,"I work very hard for The Home Depot for 9 years. As it is home improvement warehouse, I learned many technical skills but the management is the worst, very unfair in many areas. Definitely not cooperative for the life/work balance, work schedule is as they want not even fixed, very stressful. The only thing I enjoy was my coworkers."
bad,Very boring with no room for growth. Too much of sticking to the guidelines eith no wiggle room. Worked with alot of strange people who didnt care for their job.
bad,"My coworkers were the best part of the job. Without them, I would never have lasted 3 years. "
bad,"the worse place i ever worked."
bad,"overall for a co. of this size,they don't care about the people who dose the job,u could loose you job just because a customer who is in bad move and star complaint and is you fault you may just kiss good by you job,because the custumer who just expend a louse $5.00 bucks is right you are not."
bad,"If you need a paycheck, yes they will give you one. However, they will fight in order to not give you a raise and sacrifice hardworking people in order to get labor at a cheaper cost. If you choose to go into the higher ranks it only gets worse. They do not care about work/family balance, they want you there working no matter what. It is all politics and propaganda."
bad,"I would arrive at work, get prepared in all my work attire. Get to the kitchen and see where my supervisor wanted me. Once i was put on a station I would prepare my station for the what was to come."
bad,"A Typical work day for me is: In the morning I would restock the shelves, talk and assist all customers with their projects, and offer advice on their tasks. I would get with management about the days objectives. the hardest part of the job is taking products down from the overhead shelve. the most enjoyable part is talking to all the customers and seeing a smile on their faces."
bad,I work at home depot part time at nights on the weekends while im attending school.  Its low pay but flexible enough for while im in school.
bad,"Typical day is running around getting orders pulled. "
bad,"Your a part timer for life. They don't work with you if you have a 2nd job and change your schedule so much you can't plan a week ahead."
bad,The Walmart of Home Improvement . Not of enough Training for the special task required.
bad,I was looking and still are looking to build a career at the next job I work at. Home Depot didn't give me enough days or hours in order to build. They give you hours and take them back. I was working once or twice a week and I was looking forward to more hours and they couldn't offer that.
bad,A typical night at work can be exhausting. Any other store has 4 people for my position and I have to do all orders at night alone. I have been with this company for over 3 years and get looked over for supervisor positions. I do not really socialize with my co-workers too much because I am usually busy. I make a lower amount than most on my shift at night time and management has their own way of making me feel unappreciated.
bad,"Horrible management, but I did learn how to operate a forklift while I was there."
bad,"Price chopper was okay."
bad,"monitor the cashiers, parking lot attendants, contractors desk and returns"
bad,assisted customers in hardware sales worked well with others learned basic tool knowledge
bad,"A typical day at Home Depot,"
bad,Overall my first year was the best for myself.Learning and meeting alot of very nice and intelligent people.Until I transferred the first time is when negative situations started to occur.
bad,"The company culture is terrible. The pay is very low, management treats you like dirt, and it's very difficult to move up. The co-workers are great, but I hated going to work every day."
bad,I've worked there for almost a year now. If your thinking career and being able to comfortably take care of your family then my personal opinion is this isn't the company for you. To advance is nearly impossible. At the particular store that I work in our team is complained about on a daily basis. We can barely get our work done. We even been told that we are a disaster to the store. The health insurance is a little steep but if you need it then the cost doesn't matter. All around its an okay job but I don't see myself being here for a extended period of time. 
bad,Home depot is ok if this is your first job. Dont try to make a career out of it.  No advancement 
bad,The work is to hard for the pay you receive! the hours are good though and the possibility of overtime> but it is just to much work
bad,Underpayed for way too much work. should get payed more. I worked very hard every day and never got noticed for it
bad,Company paid to notch managers too much at a time when the economy was tanking and management showed very little interest in their employees and paid dismal wages. This was just a job I took while in school to cover my living expenses. I had very little interest in my job position and found myself getting board all the time and was not advancing my career.
bad,"You have to cash and zone, most co-workers are lazy and mean."
bad,"Management & staff always fighting and ""stepping"" on each other to try and get ahead and not be written up for things that would otherwise be considered ridiculous. Total CHAOS and unprofessional."
bad,"Policies are in-place, but only enforced to some. No opportunity for advancement."
bad,"typical work day starts at 5am with checking the work schedule, then viewing and printing purchase orders calling venders and suppliers. then replenishing orders, checking inventory, stocking shelfs, helping customers find the products they need while making them 100 percent happy with their product even demonstrating it to them. if lines gets back up then i would assist on running a register to move lines. in between answering manager calls/ angry customer calls and coming up with a solution. i was a key carrier so i opened and closed the store as needed."
bad,I took incoming calls for associates that dealt with Human resources. The position had no room for advancement or growth.
bad,"I worked here for almost five years, and the store went through several managers that were either fired or suddenly transferred to another location when their job was in danger."
bad,regular job
bad,"No job security, poor training, radical working hours, high pressure to sell when no customers in store. Favoritism from management , hard to advance qualified employees. Management will not back employees from abusive customer. Poor working condition. Poor scheduling (covering more than one dept.) Lack of overlapping coverage. Not allowing breaks. End of month running out of supplies, ie toilet paper, paper towels, toner and paper for printers. Fudging the numbers for inventory."
bad,Home Depot has devalued its long term employees by eliminating the amount of  associate coverage per department thereby adding more work to the older seasoned employees and with unfair compensation. Large turnover for all the part-timers they hire now instead of full-timers. Lots of favouritism within the company structure and negativity. Management turnover extremely high.
bad,"When I started work there, it was already a slow burning mess. Employees left without two weeks notice, managers would not commincate with new staff what the tasks were, leaving other floor staff to try and help train us. We were always expected to be on the computers to do training, but the training rarely applied to the store we were at, nor would anything we learn come up or be useful. Every single day was spent learning new things and struggling to keep pace. The story was constantly understaffed, leaving many departments barren or with only a single employee running an entire department, sometimes even two or three. Towards the end of my stay, we had lost our store manager, several other managers had simply given up and left without notice, with many employees following suit. Upon my return to collect my things after completing my final two weeks, they had begun terminating older staff to cut costs, leaving only newer employees who had no knowledge of what was going on to run the floor."
bad,"If. you are business minded and money driven, you should be able to move up fairly quickly. You are always on your feet and the week never passes in monotony."
bad,"Online training was not very applicable to your actual job. Management was not at all supportive, in fact, somewhat condescending. I loved what I did and interacting with customers to help with their project. My peers and I experienced a total lack of appreciation for doing our job well."
bad,Individuals I worked with showed little concern for the welfare of others.  Very little communication between management and workforce.  Quit due to medical reasons and schedule.
bad,"Management is unprofessional, they share personal employee files and complaints. No conflict resolution. The Managers either ignore or transfer. Constant gossiping and drama as well as promotion suppression, if you are apart of a certain click they promote if not they try to get you fired."
bad,"You are hired you get a position which is basically mundane. Same thing day in and day out. Learning is what you do on your own, company provides very little. Management? You will not receive comments on what you do well, only pointing out what you did wrong. Hardest part of the job is staffing is kept at a minimum (management's objective to keep operating costs lower to enhance their bonuses) and scheduling to meet customer demand. Most enjoyable part is camaraderie between base level employees. You can make new friends."
bad,"The job its self was okay, it is definitely a job that is harder to work at when you are younger, I got the job there are 17 and all the other employees were way older, I felt like that they gave them the okay to walk all over me and just always blame things on me, When I worked there I felt under paid because I was doing everything a lead cashier would do but I wasn't allowed the raise because I was to young, so i was doing everything for my lead cashier because she didn't actually know anything and she would get all the credit"
bad,"corrupt  hr family of despotism "
bad,"Work environment was ok at first. Gossip and favortism are high here. They give some people the hours they want and put up a fuss with others over there schedules. They say this but do that. They don't pay enough per hr! I took a pay cut to work there, such a dumb idea! I'm worth more then they were willing to pay me!!!"
bad,"I was hired to work as a customer service representative in one department, but was put in a cashier position. I hated cashier because we were forced to ask every customer to apply for a Home Depot credit card. "
bad,"They don't give rises during the course of the year. Management doesn't support the associates on the floor. Unfair practices of companies rules,and management avoids conflicts"
bad,"Employees are given stupid awards, and promoted, purely based on managers that give special treatment to employees that they like, regardless of their demeanor and work ethic. There is so much rampant favoritism at the Danvers, MA location that it is often difficult to stomach it. There seems to be no validation or promotion opportunities for the employees who are pleasant and helpful to the customers, go out of their way to give exceptional customer service, and actually do their jobs, as opposed to goofing off with the assistant store managers. The pay is ridiculously low compared to other retail jobs and employees do not get benefits unless they are full-time. The store schedules employees consistently under full-time hours in order to not have to give meal breaks and benefits. Most of the older cashiers are grumpy, disrespectful, and outright mean to customers and other cashiers. There is no employee discount, in fact, the only discount available is for military veterans with proper ID. But if customers put up a bit of a fuss, they will get a discount for being pushy and argumentative. There are no employee meetings to make sure that everyone is consistent on company policies so it's basically a free for all when it comes to which unruly customer gets a discount by which cashier and at which visit to the store. Completely disgusted in this company."
bad,"Honestly this job was great for a first job out of high school or even in high school honestly, but in the long term it isn't worth it at all. The longer you're there the more you realize that they don't care about your life outside of that place and set high bars that difficult to reach. If you try and do this as well as be a full-time student, don't expect them to care about your school work."
bad,"I am currently a University Student and /Environment  there is VERY FAST PACED, Stressful and NEEDs help on Weekends especially in lumber!! Retail sucks period, but job for now."
bad,"Extremely cliquey"
bad,"They pay less than minimum wage and work you to death. Fewer staff members means you do the work of 6 people. Sucks"
bad,Don't work for home Depot they don't pay anything. Unless you have a criminal background and can't get another gig then they come in handy. They really don't have advancement unless you kiss butt. I had to leave to better my lifestyle and would  not go back.
bad,Always punish by actions given to management. Given opportunity and understanding promotion but taken away for advancement..... No teamwork.. Not exceeding what they promise to achieve your goals..
bad,poor management pay isn't very well either... Store side is lazy and not helpful ... You can never find them .. Met team is no put together well .. Lack of responsibility supervisor
bad,"Demanding, need to have thick skin, problem solve, be able to fix other employee's mistakes. Everyone is part time and almost impossible to secure full time employment."
bad,"The home depot is a steady job at the most but overall was very stressful lots of changes every day, you have to multitask to get things done management was hardly around and very hard to find but when they were around they were very rude angry and never had time for anything, and the scheduling was all over the place the never had enough hours but had very little associates"
bad,"Worked there for 4 years and 7 months. Started part-time at 9.50 an hour and left at full time at 15.00 an hour. As much as HD preaches the importance of customer satisfaction, in-store management is largely apathetic. The scheduling is horrible with a single employee in a department on peak hours and weekends. I worked in appliance sales and more often than not was the only appliance person on the floor for Sundays and the last days of our big sales. I made 975,000 in appliance sales in 2017 and 1,000,000 in 2018, For my 1 million that I made the store, I got a plaque, and a ""homer award"" that you need to collect a bunch of before they actually turn into cash on your paycheck. I'm quitting this place and going somewhere where I will make commission on my 1 million in annual sales. Oh, they offered 2 dollars an hour more if I stayed. Where was that 2 dollars when I hit 1 million? The kicker for me was when I was called about 15min of overtime that I ""had to cut"". Here I am, an employee that made you 1 million in sales last year, never calls off, helps out in other departments, operates the heavy machinery and you are hassling me about 15min of overtime? Yeah, time to look for something else, glad I found it. Bottom line, it is a steady paycheck and you really can't get fired unless you really mess up or call off to often. But, you will ""top out"" at 17-20 an hour. You never escape the reality that you are easily replaceable and they really don't care about anyone who isn't salaried management."
bad,"The job was trash complete trash. The management makes a lot of promises that are never acted on. If you do not hound them they will forget about you and tell you they didn't, or tell you that you are a liar. All in all it was a bad job."
bad,"Store management had unrealistic expectations, scheduling was erratic work till close one day, open the next. If you had to go to the bathroom,managers"
bad,Everything I did and did so much more than my job described. To only get a .25 cent raise my first yr was a disgrace. I should of quit but stayed another year and recieved a much better raise. It's a game there to get raises. They want you to do 10 different things and still give great customer service. Than found out someone gets paid a $1.00 because they speak Spanish. Just not right.
bad,"Improve management especially in merchandising group. "
bad,"They work you so hard! They want blood, sweat and tears for that $11/hour. Very inconsistent scheduling, some weeks-35 hrs, the next week it would be 14 hrs. There was drama with employees, dishonest managers, massive pay inconsistencies from employee to employee. Latinos are never promoted here, saw them passed over routinely for promotions. Lots of turnover, never ever ever enough employees for the number of customers, routinely missed my breaks because of the  work load and long lines of customers."
bad,the current management has hired from outside the store rather than promote current associates.  I myself have been passed over three times for department supervisor positions when they have hired outside people.  Two of whom have quit in less then a month one didn't even last a week.
bad,Home depot was just a way to get by for a few months ! There's no growth there. You can be there 15 years and still be nothing more than a sales associate
bad,"My first store was stressful, especially after we got a new manager. My new store is terrifying. There is an armed officer at the door, and many staff members are rewarded for nothing."
bad,"as a cashier at the home depot at Harrison Crossing unless your in the garden center you basically just stand in place till closing. i generally worked the 2 to 10 shift. after about 5pm traffic slowed below a crawl there would be 1 pro-desk cashier, 1 self checkout attendant and 1 garden cashier. after the garden would close down and you were brought inside you would just stand at the second register from 7 to 10. i would generally beg to be allowed to flat stack wood or zone any department  or just do anything productive but cashiers were only allowed to stand at the register unless you were helping load something for a customer. Sometimes depending on the head cashier that day i would be allowed to do something productive. "
bad,Im not happy at this work place. Alot of favoritism and i dont feel like room for advancement can be accomplished unless you know someone. No one listens
bad,i did not enjoy this job at all. I do not enjoy a job where I do not have a lot of product knowledge. I worked in Lumber and building materials. I was cut and bruised on a regular basis. Not fun.
bad,"Under new manager, unable to advance to a higher position. She started to bring in her own people from other stores, preventing us that have been there for a while, to move up. Very unfair treatment for good work. I've been there 2 years, and I only got a .04 cent raise, because minimum wage went up!"
bad,"Not paid well enough for an extreme amount of work with unreasonable goal expectations, communication issues store side to corporate, and the heads (DEMs,MEMs) are the worst, not knowing all that our work actually requires, and giving nonsensical responses because they have no idea. I preferred working storeside and if they weren't cutting hours, I would transfer without an issue."
bad,"A typical day consists of tending customer, making orders, learning about installation and other building and shipping practices. Management was deceitful and greedy. used employees to carry out not appropriate jobs and hindered growth for employees intentionally. Worst part was having to assemble orders for customers by hand, meaning gathering all the concrete, tile, tools, and pallets of items by hand since the make getting a fork lift licence impossible. They will not be enough when the medical bill hits because of a herniated disc, which they will not compensate for. Instead they will threaten to sure you with their high end lawyers."
bad,Work there for over 10year. By the time I left in 2017i was only making 13.37 for A total of 18years . If your a single mother and have sick kids or even kids with special needs children please don't apply for this jobs there not supportive at all when it come to missing days or even taking half of days . And if your the type to have a lot going on the have no kinda of sympathy for you at all if your schedule is set then make sure that you plan around your schedule . I can go on but that would take a book
bad,"The team at Home Depot isn’t bad, the management is horrible though. When 6 managers can’t stay on the same page, they jerk associates around and nobody knows what’s going on. I do not recommend this store unless you never want to move up for the right reasons. Hard work is not rewarded, it’s exhausted until associates no longer have the will nor the morale to help."
bad,"Working there felt like being on the lower decks of the Titanic.  No matter what skills you brought to the job, they went unused.  Store management was a turnover.  There were three store directors in the time I was there.  It's all about the $$$ and nothing else."
bad,For the amount of work/demands Home Depot does not compare well to other companies. I'm sure it is hard to compete with other that pay well in this area: finance and health care.
bad,"Manager Horrible they blame their mistake on the employee to cover up their terrible.IN  the interview they lie about the hours ,the salary, and most of all they tell you your co-workers at the store your assigned get you appointments for in home sales it a lie you have to go to the store and catch customers to set-up appointments ."
bad,if you're not a favorite you will not be recognized no matter how hard you work if you do not brown nose or try to be friends with management ie hanging out outside of work youll never go anywhere
bad,"·	Unloaded outside and docked trucks with forklifts and pacer units."
bad,Its just a bad environment to work in. The managers and supervisors would treat you bad . And the store manager was extremely sexist and didn’t want “a woman in a mans job”
bad,Management was always asking for more than could be done with the limited staff on given shifts. I learned a lot about products in my department.  I did a lot of sales with the knowledge learned from co-workers.  The hardest part was never having a forklift available when needed.
bad,"high paced, high stress, low pay, no respect, can never find a manager or a employee who is covering a department. You get cussed out by customers and written up by managers for stupid stuff."
bad,"As with any large company, it really depends on the group of people you work with and the manager of your team. Some are awesome and supportive, and will make you believe you can do anything in the world. These are the best ones to work for. However, there are an equal, if not larger group of folks that do not follow the company values and create a rather hostile environment. Avoid these areas."
bad,"It is what it is, no less no more. Corporate America at its finest. So if you enjoy working like a dog then this is absolutely the place for you to lose the next 20 years of your life."
bad,"the hours that I was given were shortened considerably by week for minimum wage. was not worth working in the sun all day, no benefits for part time employees, no opportunity for advancement, and no motivation to work"
bad,"My schedule was 5 am to 2 pm. The hardest part of the job was maintained the hours and the supervisor. The workplace culture was lacking, advancement was not a given even with hard work."
bad,"Easy money, but after a while everyone becomes toxic (exception of a few people) l, the managers don’t really bother at taking care of you, and if you say something you get on their bad side."
bad,Everyone is over worked and management doesnt care  nothing is being done to ease the work load on people and we are loosing employees faster than we can hire them
bad,This is a good job for younger people only seeking part time. Very few opportunities to move up and no opportunity for full-time if you're not hired on as full-time
bad,Terrible work environment for someone who cares about doing a good job and advancing in life. Only good for people who are lazy and want to be a poorly functioning cashier for their entire life.
bad,"I would Never go back to home depot."
bad,"A typically work day would be clock in and get information on which register would be working, greeting customers, and ring up each and other customers properly."
bad,"I started as a pert-timer and hired as a full-timer."
bad,"Just don't get sick or have much family life. When you work there your expected to live for work till you collapse in the store. The only pro is some of the people there made it tolerable, barely."
bad,"I was full time, it took me four years to get that. I started off part-time working approx 20-38 hrs per week. I typically worked in one department, yet I was all over the store, helping customers. The hours are brutal, unless your in with the office people. You wont get set hours, unless you are in with the click. So a typical week you may work a 5-1 on Monday and Tuesday, have two days off then work a 2-11pm then the next day back to a 5-1pm and you will most defiantly work weekends. "
bad,"Hypocrisy city. Really poor pay raises, after waiting a full year for it. No other wage increases. Two bonuses but they're taxed and you basically only get anything decent if you've been stuck there longer than three years. People here are literally so miserable all they do is create drama and focus on what everybody else is or isn't doing, they'll make up stories and run with them to management - basically high school. You'll get a lot of ""good job!""s and occasional lunches that half of us don't even touch. Management is a migraine, says all your problems are stupid. The place is backwards. If you have another option DONT WORK HERE."
bad,Some of the management was good. But once the store manager changed seemed to go downhill. Definitely do not always appreciate their employees. Tried going back to work there and was very astonished with all my experience they wanted to put me in a department that I had no experience for to pay me as little as possible.
bad,"I did not enjoy working there. To many times did I get told something by an ASM and then told to do the exact opposite by another ASM, and then later told something else entirely different by the Store Manager. They were never on the same page and that made it really difficult to complete any task given to me."
bad,"I worked in the inside and outside garden, taking care of the plants, watering them, fertilizing them, and also taking care of the customers and giving them suggestions and recommendations."
bad,the management was poor and very little help.typical work day stressful. Only cared about the bottom line. the people on the floor real understand what is going on.
bad,working conditions were very odd. Tasks i was asked to do were out of my limits. Training was minimal and not great. Tried my best but it was ever good enough.
bad,Was lied too all of the time by any superiors. Was told at one point to lie to a contract rental box truck location about there being a problem with a truck that didn't exhist so it would be swapped because really the back lift gate was being broken off at welds from employees drvining a forklift on it when instructed not to. Insane attendance policy. Total disregard from management towards any associate under them as well as racist. Never been so blown away by how horrifically a business ran until I came here.
bad,"No work/home life balance"
bad,"The managers had ""favorites.."" The hours were inconsistent from 12 to 32 seasonally.  They often promised and didn't deliver. The best people for jobs here are retired or high school students.  They treat people poorly and fire you if you do not sell credit cards (I had a high credit card sales) even if you have worked for them for years."
bad,"Hard Work dealing with customers, meeting sales targets, stocking shelves, merchandising and maintaining good relations with other departments.  Very little respect given to sales associates for other work experience that is used in the daily work.  Supervisors and Assistant Managers are strictly looking after their own needs and very seldom help or assist with the daily duties on the floor.  Wages are very low for the amount of work expected. This is one of the few companies that provides bonuses and benefits after one year service to part time workers.  Culture is that they promote equality, environmental concern and care but do not practice this in reality.  Hardest part is dealing with some of the directives that do not make sense from a remote head office in Toronto.  Best part is dealing with contractors and the general public who appreciate your help and experience."
bad,There is no advancement for older tendered associates. I was a 46 year old  associate that was passed over 6 time in the past 12 years for an ASM position for less tendered and younger associates.
bad,"However, you are not just a cashier they schedule you for an entire NEW position with the term "" Assist"""
bad,For individuals without children and/or your schedule doesn't circulate around them this might be the job for you. Agian let me just say I felt blessed to find a better job.
bad,"Far to many customers and to few staff. Management not very helpful. Poor balance between hard workers and those who just do enough to get by. Pay is average at best considering the size of the company. Moral is an issue, poor training for new hires."
bad,They expected too much of the stocking in a timely manner that was almost not possible. The HR department was not understanding and considerate of my departure of my job.
bad,Advancement is limited and they take every opportunity to take advantage of anyone willing to work.  Management is not very concerned about treating their employees fairly.  The employees I worked with were great - management is not so good.
bad,I would not recommend Home Depot to anyone. Too much stress and not worth the pay. No room for advancement unless you wanted to get wrapped up in playing games within company politics.
bad,"Home Depot pays the bulk of their employees min wage."
bad,"It's your typical Big Box Retail story, overworked, underpaid, and under appreciated. You a truly ""Just A Number"" working for Depot, and it's comparable to High School, if you aren't in the ""In Crowd"", good luck. Also, if you aren't dating a co-worker, good luck finding more than a day out of the week to spend time with them, as your schedule will almost never benefit you."
bad,Its not that great they mess around to much there it take forever to get answers there point and call off system horrible u have to do everything or nothing will get down
bad,"Long hard hours and management lacks communication and doesn't value there employees. Not honest with the employees."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job because the right hand doesn't know what the letter had is doing. Upper management doesn't care about the employees that are under them. They say they have an ""open door"" policy but that isn't true.. They won't fire you but they will make your life miserableuntil you quit"
bad,"I would probably recommend this company to people for work if they would treat people like actual people and not slaves. It's one of those places where the saying ,"" It's not personal it's just business."" rings true. They don't care about their employees mental or physical state of being. They hire and fire at will for very little reason with no remorse for the added strain that they are placing on the rest of the team at all."
bad,Very stressful job. Very busy not enough employees for the amount of customers. Management would not back you up or help out. The pay sucked for as much work that every position held
bad,working at the home depot was horrible. they showed favoritism and were very unfair. did not receive raises when we were supposed to and management was very biased
bad,"If working with a bunch of new part time associates sounds appealing to you, then The Home Depot is the place for you. With management no where to be found, and employee knowledge lacking - it is almost impossible to finish a shift without issues."
bad,"Lowest paid management position I've ever had.  No weekends off, rarely have evenings off.  Upper management expects department heads to work every weekend so they can take off."
bad,"No thank you, not interested in saying anything about Home Depot. Not sure why you insist that I do. If that 's what's require then just close my account. I have nothing good or bad to put here."
bad,"The day to day for me at Home Depot is so stressful that I dread going to work, things that should be simple are made more difficult by the management team. I just need to spread my wings and find a new journey."
bad,Company has gone down hill drastically in the past 5 years. Not a place I would recommend to anyone. Employeers do not care about employees. Over worked no lunch break on many occassions.
bad,They barely schedule you and will make you work on weekends and they set your schedule a month in advance so it's harder to take off. They also showed favoritism to certain employees.
bad,"I was a"" part time"" employee but I worked 40's hours a week for 3 months then for a month strait I would work 20 hours a week. Then back to 40's just so they could keep me as a part time employee and not give me the benefits I deserved. They would work me 13 days in a row. I was a top performing cashier. Yet they messed with me all they could. I was trained and worked in every department but they would never transfer me because they didn't want to give me the raise."
bad,"I was the team coach, as well as the safety captain. Everynight I would give the group meeting, then lead the team in what we called stretch and flex.."
bad,"Chaotic work atmosphere.  Harassment concerning amount of work required.  Must work excessive years for any opportunity for advancement (says opportunity to be hired from within, but company hires excessively from outside the company."
bad,They treat their employees as if they do not matter(while saying that the employee is the most important). Management is a joke and HR is ridicules and can not do their jobs.
bad,I can say after working for this home Depot I will personally never work for another again. Managers play favorite's if your not one of their favorites your pretty much left to fend for yourself. They could care less about problems with the store. Most the employees suck and don't take their job seriously. It's way to political. Not a place I would EVER recommend anyone to apply.
bad,"only opportunity of advancement with the company would be to transfer to the store. A monkey can to the job, its so boring. You're just a number and not an asset. Raises are a joke. Every year 20 cents."
bad,"a typical day at work is basic customer service, and shelve maintenance and covering other departments, i learned that most supervisors were not good leaders, management goes by the words of only the supervisors and no other staff, hardly any culture due to staff turnaround time, hardest part of job, is covering multiple departments due to poor scheduling practices, the most enjoyable part of the day is the end of your shift"
bad,"Hyper competitive managers who are credited with firing people.  I have nothing good to say about Home Depot.  I have had worse jobs,"
bad,"Night shift work included getting various freight from the truck brought to which ever department you had been stationed at. Then you would replenish empty spots with new products the rest was stored above. You would then fill any empty spots with products if possible. Stocking shelves essentially. If skilled on the machines you would use forklift for lumber or seasonal dept. Reach and or order pickers for anywhere else. I learned plenty about store operations and the details that one has to pay attention to when replenishing products in the store."
bad,"Perfectly fine place to work for at first, then the labor cuts start happening, overall nice place at first, but too much work, not enough staff. part time was bearable."
bad,"Horrible management, could careless about your personal life. Does not offer competitive benefits; low wages; low annual raises; HR FAVORS Corporate and management."
bad,"I got to learn about gardening. Managers couldn't be found whenever you needed them. schedule was always fluctuating, It was just a temporary summer job."
bad,"I thought my initial responsibilities were to be in the nursery area at Home Depot caring for the plants. However, I was expected to move around to several different areas of the store and be knowledgeable about the products in each area."
bad,"Don't work there, they are slave drivers. Pound you in the pavement. Pay does not equal the amount of work they expect from you for 10 hrs a day. You have to make your times but they have old equipment with 2017 numbers to run."
bad,"Co-workers are great.  Management has no clue but how could they when they are always in the back room.  They treat employees like slaves, they talk down to them, and are generally unpleasant to them.  One female manager (Blond) is the worst, oh sorry did I forget to salute you today my furor?"
bad,"worked multiple desks. I have learned a a lot about construction, home and garden. Most of the management was alright, most of them were good. the hardest part of the job was that i was brought in as a full time person and then was only a part time person. the only enjoyable part of the job was the supervisor and she was great at her job, i liked working for her."
bad,My co-workers are the best part of that job. Most of the associates are team members and will assist you with most any request. Do not care for their scheduling methods.
bad,"don't remember much so I can't say much, never was enough staffing and walking in Home depot today I see the same thing no staffing"
bad,"I applied for a sales job and expected to be advising and helping customers, but they put me in the Lumber department where my main job seemed to be re-stacking lumber and restocking shelves. After three months on the job I developed soreness in my wrist and they found a way to can me."
bad,The managers at my store always seem to have an attitude all the time.  I have been constantly promised full-time position but never given one. And they always cutting back hours. No one can live on a part time position.
bad,"This was a great experience in using my training on sales. Worked during the period after a hurricane in the Beaumont, Tx area. Was 100% commission based and had to little help in obtaining my goals."
bad,"Ridiculous work load, favoritism blatant among management, no overtime. People with certain orientations are treated with favoritism among other ""groups"". Pay is horrible. Definitely not a living wage and no consideration for performance."
bad,"I was lead on I was going to get a full time job.  no set hours, no benifits,no nothing."
bad,"You have little or no career path at Home Depot. They talk a big game and promise a good career path and training to make sure it happens, but does not happen if you are a older person with a great management background. The hours of scheduling are radical at best and you are always under manned and over worked for very little compensation. Although I was rated a 5 out 5 performance for my work evaluation I was never considered for promotion because I was pigeon holed in a certain area and increased their sales by over 20% in the departments I was assigned to work in.  Would I recommend a career path at Home Depot. Only if you want to be a slave to the company if you are a department manager or assistant store manager. They are very much abused."
bad,"Needs new management and needs to have more communication among workers. Very unorganized, and the only good thing about home depot are the homer awards they give you towards your paycheck. But even then you need three homer awards just to get money added to your paycheck."
bad,"Terrible training program, workplace atmosphere feels extremely immature. Not a safe work environment for young females."
bad,"My biggest issue is that u have no way of advancing unless the boss is your friend. It doesn't matter how hard you work or what you do."
bad,"My biggest issue is that u have no way of advancing unless the boss is your homie doesn't matter how hard you work or what you do."
bad,"Too much favoritism in waldorf md  is hard to get promoted,  they do have a lot of free food wich I did not care for.  They don't paid a lot and many times I was by myself answering phone orders return phone sale because they did not schedule people, the training was bad just training in the computer, not much on hand on training.  No supply for the front like tape, supervisor was never schedule with new employee to train, Mod were micro management,  but when you ask for help from them,  there were not there to help, mod don't know the customer system only two of them the rest of them just very little. Mod don't even said thank you to employees for working hard, they just pick and choose if you are in the click you are in, I'm not mad just another experience for me in this company."
bad,"Good job for someone just out of high school, rate of pay is not enough for all the work they expect you to do. Co workers can be very mean, Management doesn't act on information provided in urgent situations. Overall i did learn a lot from this store.  I learned how to operate all the equipment in the store and i had to be very insisting to be taught."
bad,Customer based environment. Its a retail so you can't expect much. While I did my best management did everything to ensure i was still at the bottom. I had one of my manager deny me a promotion because of a gossip he heard which was not even true. By the time i reported he resigned.
bad,"I would never know what my schedule was until the night before, and when I was hired I was told I would be working 5 days a week, with a possibility of more, and for the last six plus months I have averaged only 4 days a week."
bad,The first time I worked for Home Depot was amazing and I felt like the company was supportive and ethical..but the most recent experience I had with the company was in an environment that was hostile and bias..very unethical and inappropriate
bad,"managment was horrible at the home depot, no acomodations for any thing personal "
bad,"The work is not too terrible but coworkers and management can make it not worth it.  Bad culture of negativity and ""that's not my job"" attitudes.  Based on your job title you will either be bored all shift or sweat bullets for 8 hours."
bad,"No opportunity for advancement if wanting to move up in the store you already work at. Must relocate to get ahead."
bad,"I started out really enjoying my job, then after a bout a year, things began going down hill. I was always part time, but I went from getting 26-30 hours per week, down to getting 4-8 hours a week. Right before my annual review, new SOPs were put into place and I was only able to get a twenty cent raise and it took two months for that! They began penalizing some people, but not all for being tardy, which raised many suspicions. They began firing people for nonsense and putting under qualified individuals in positions that they definitely didn't deserve. I saw so much corruption there at the east Montgomery location."
bad,"retail hours so if you opened you had a list to complete before the store opened..and making sure if you close that the department your working in is ready to open. I learned a lot from them I only wished that I could have continued. My co-works were and still are amazing they , we were a great team. the hardest part, the heat during the summer! Enjoyable part< helping my customers!"
bad,Management is so fake and insincere. Unsafe working conditions management says they will look into it and nothing is done.
bad,"It was my first retail job, and I really don't recommend it. I didn't really learn anything about hardware. All I learned was how to properly organize carts in the parking lot."
bad,Home Depot is a decent place to work if you are in a sales department and try to advance that way. If you are a member of Loss Prevention you are under appreciated and will never get promoted.
bad,I worked for Home Depot for a very long time it is unfortunate that I have to say that I wasted my life/time and energy for a company that does not appriciate nor value the employees. Most managers simply do not have any management skill. Top level management just worry about the shareholders and their own profit. Accountability only applies to associates not management.
bad,The schedule was very poorly managed and the schedule manager always acted to busy to help out anyone but herself. I will never work for Home Depot again because it is a closed minded atmosphere that has a seniority to the schedule and job advancements. After a couple weeks of working overnight making sure that I was doing everything I could to be speedy and consistent the Manager kept telling me to stick with it and I would do good. After a month I realized that some people were being phased in and some phased out. I didn't want to write a bad review about this corporation but to my knowledge it is poorly managed and very one sided working for Home Depot.
bad,"I have experienced a massive education at this job. I have worked in numerous departments and have helped thousands of customers find what they need to effectively complete projects. I have trained many new employees how to successfully attain customer satisfaction as well as live the company values each day. My experience with this job has contributed to my vast knowledge of sales, inventory control and customer service."
bad,"Merchandising/Audits"
bad,"The Home Depot was not the best place to work at, but I do have to say that every associate in the store, cares for each other, and treats  one another as family."
bad,An associate is scheduled based on the availability of the store; any schedule requests from the associate are usually denied. Associates life and/or second job comes second to Home Depot.
bad,"I liked my job, but 14 to 28 hrs a week i could not live on it. im looking for full time 40+ hrs ."
bad,They say they traine but really they push you through and hope you get it but when it comes to it they really don't have time to help you they through you to the wolfes and hope you swim
bad,they are not a strong equal opportunity company     it is all who you know company
bad,My work was to get carts from the parking lot and organize them and get them ready for the customers. I also had to help customers load and unload their items. Be outside in the sun all afternoon.
bad,"low compensation, expensive health care, not many oppotunities for advancement"
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management team and them not wanting you to advance in the work place
bad,"Very Busy, the hardest part of the job was standing for a super long time while pregnant with my daughter. Didn't get more breaks, or sit on a chair."
bad,"I learned a lot about logistics and how to operate forklifts, reach trucks, order pickers and electric pallet jacks."
bad,"On feet for long period of time "
bad,It's a cashier job. Some people will like it. Others won't. After awhile it is irritating specially since you can start working at 5:30. You are expected to keep your scores at 9. 
bad,I would work very hard and make sales and win awards a this company.i loved my job. unfortunately i was laid off.
bad,"Hours are bad, management poor, under 40 hrs work each week. not enough employees , work more than one dept at a time. A lot of people taking advange of the system by not working and management not taking action to get rid of dead weight so the working people suffer the most. Also the lazy people get the easy work load and call out the most."
bad,"The pay is no where near what it used to be Home Depot used to be the place to get a job and they paid you for what you know and now it doesn't start much above minimum wage. Full time is almost none existent and if a full time position opens the manager already knows who they want to give it to regarless of qualifications. Schedules are extremely varied close one day open the next with very few weekends off if any, Asking for a weekend off has to have a good reason to get one. They cut hours during the week when we are already short. If you stay to cover a call off you have to cut it another day because you can't have over time. I you ask for help with a problem they never get back with you. They don't help anyone move up any more especially females. The District Managers prefer to hire from outside of the company and bring in friends from their previous companies. Co-workers are disgruntled because of the managers in the store and above because no one seems to appeciate the hard work and the customer service they provide on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is the lack of recognition for a job well done by management. They aren't out there with us helping customers and seeing what is going on in their own stores, The most enjoyable part is helping customers and getting them what they need to do their project."
bad,"A typical day 5-8 hours checking and helping customers out. I learned a new computer system. Management had their favorites and were unfair to those that they didn't like or those that didn't go along with their views. Co-workers were unfriendly and not a team oriented place of employment. The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated for the long hours, the varied shifts and the sincere,helpful way that we dealt with customers. The most enjoyable part of my employment with Home Depot was meeting and helping out the people that came in to shop"
bad,"The minute I walked into work I began to stock material all night because I worked nights. I did learn how to use many different equipment that the store provided, which was forklift, slip sheet, electrical pallet jack, wave, reach, and an order picker. The co-workers and management were good people to work for. The most enjoyable part of my job learning how to work all the machines."
bad,The scheduling of this company is so off the wall one wonders if it is not an intentional psychological assault on the employees.
bad,I had fun working with co workers and loved my job just management and scheduling need works.
bad,"This company looks at you as a number not a person, they dont look at the work you do, only thing tthat matters to them is numbers. store 6560 has a buddy club where if you are not in good with managment then u dont get ""special favors""."
bad,entry level low pay bad schedules
bad,Home depot has no reguard for employees.
bad,All employees seemed warn out with no motivation or life goals ahead of them. I worked as a temporary cashier. I was happy to leave Home Depot. The Store manager was an egomaniac. Honestly... Too many people working at home depot think they're important and need to understand that their roll in society is very little.
bad,"The customers stress you out, have no patience. Sales associates are overwhelmed most of the time and the pay is not enough or doesn't equal the amount of work and expertise some employees provide. The shifts are irregular and sometimes they make you work six days in a row with a day off in between. You never get any weekends off unless you are a full time employee. The supervisors don't help out when its busy rather runaway from the scene. Most people are afraid to speak up even if they disagree with management."
bad,"upper management has too many favorites,"
bad,"I have been at Home Depot for a year and some months and it doesn't seem to be getting any better i have hurt myself twice on the job yet they do not provide the equipment needed for the job to be done i have no problem with working i give my 130% everyday i go to work i actually do what most guys won't do as far as lifting and helping customers load (not saying I'm better than any other man) but most are found to be sorry. The enjoyable part of the job is when you help someone in need to find what their looking for the saddest hardest part is when they ask for help and the product is right there in their faces. What i learned by working at the home Depot is that i have to start looking after ME cause the managers don't, their main concern is district managers coming for a visit and writing people up in not knowing anything....My biggest issue is when you post your availability to the job they don't Honor it like they know that you have nothing else better to do than to live at the Home Depot they don't think you have a life so they deny your request in not knowing you're a full time student first in college or high school and you cant work crazy hours....Like i said I learned that I have to look out for me first cause they won't"
bad,Company values supervisor positions over doing the right thing.
bad,"Home Depot Can Be a Fun Place To Work And Also Can Have Many Advantages, But The Company Does Have Its Tolls On How To Treat People."
bad,"As a part time job while in school not a bad job. Looking for long term, find something different.  Management does not care about you as an employee.  Everything is bottom line"
bad,One of the biggest mistakes I ever made i my life wastes of my life and time.ok for a second job if convenient for you and needed a little more money per month to make ends meet.I put in a little over two years all different hours per week worked my butt off stayed busy never walked by a customer sold the entire job.All to be cut to part time benefits taken and for a 12c raise.but put me on the schedule 38 hours a week
bad,"Horrible pay, no employee discount, no security, store robbed daily, dirty store, not enough help, store is very unorganized, a lot of favoritism by management"
bad,The people that work here are amazing the only reason i continued to work there. The management isnt to bad but could definitely be better but overall its an okay place to work
bad,"Everything I thought about working for the Big Orange was greatly fluffed and miss leading. Poor management, poor pay, no support, and bus throwers to."
bad,Working at Home Depot is okay if you are looking for a way to make extra money. Not a job you would be able to live off of. You can rarely get any promotions and the managers only talk to you when corporate is around. But other than that it’s an ok place to work. I wouldn’t recommend it as anyone’s first choice and it all depends on point of view and location.
bad,At first it feels like management cares and like they want you there but right off the bat I had bad vibes off of a couple of managers. Some talk to you like you’re stupid or a child and don’t have basic respect for you. They aren’t as flexible with hours like they say they are and once i requested a schedule change the Hiring manager cut more of my hours. There’s barely anybody working which makes it harder for me to my job. They expect us to tolerate disrespect and I feel as though it’s a toxic environment for me.
bad,"I love working there but I need better management leaders and more hours , I don’t like being full time and still not getting my 40 hours I need to be able to provide for my son and wife other than that there wasn’t any issues"
bad,Extremely long hours for not so great pay. Getting a pay raise is extremely hard. High retaliation for not doing things how they want or questioning certain members of management.
bad,not much to say except the pay was horrible for the physical and mental work and for getting certified for things such as forklift. only up to a 33 cent raise a year.
bad,I didn't like the working experience at home depot. I won't be reapplying or returning to Home Depot after my experience of working there for 13 months.
bad,"Home Depot is a decent paying job, but they are not flexible with schedules. They do not understand nor care to listen to the employee’s needs. Supervisors are entitled and let their position get the best of them."
bad,"Management is a joke at the Midtown location.  They do not appreciate or care about their employees.  There is absolutely no communication among them and some of themact like children.  All they care about is their money and making things look good on paper.  They make themselves out to be a great company with a family like environment that really cares, appreciates and takes care of their employees but that is not the reality."
bad,I don’t feel like the store I am at is in it for the company anymore or much of the customers/ associates. I you cant contact  your manager at a timely manner or your Hr. Requests and changes made for your person takes over 6 mos. to be put in affect. Change’s you cant even get help when it comes to proper scheduled breaks and being pregnant on that note its a bit tough. I love this company but I just think the store needs belp.With management and Department Supervisors.
bad,Your nothing there unless your a salaried manager. It's a meatgrinder on the floor. Most of the associates hate working there. Lots of promises no delivery on them. Don't listen to the corporate propaganda.
bad,"It’s very hard to progress and move up in the company. They say that they live by the core values but they really don’t. The pay is good , but I rather work somewhere where the people that I’m working for actually cares about there employers ."
bad,I worked here for four years and was constantly passed over for promotions but was told maybe next time just work on this. I worked long hours and never was given a decent raised after every yearly review. Full-time hours but only part time pay and benefits was not for me.
bad,"Lots of shift work is required. Very hard to have a work/life balance.There was a lack of staffing making it difficult to help customers. Co-worker were great to work with."
bad,"I was supervisor.  I had no set hours or days.  And, as a supervisor,  I closed every Wednesday night and was scheduled till 11 but rarely ever got out that early. "
bad,"There was zero structure. Managers didn't know the names of most people and were completely detached from the actual workers. Most employees would shirk their work to the best of their abilities and never received any kind of repercussions. On multiple occasions I was scolded for things I was never supposed to attend to, such as working the saw. (I was a lot associate) They eventually cut my hours down below 10 a week and I was forced to put in my 2 weeks. Zero understanding, Zero management awareness and Zero teamwork. The only reason I was able to endure 6 months was the very dedicated and motivated teamwork of the long time employees who genuinely wanted the company to succeed. I worked at the Seminole store 6304."
bad,"Lousy pay, lousy hours they vary from week to week so you can't get another pt job cause you can't plan on the hours plus you can't plan family events with other members of your family who work cause never get the same day off or even biweekly so you can plan anything they get very upset if you ever get hurt on the job"
bad,First couple of years was ok to work for.  New management came in and everything fell apart.   Asked for full time as being a veteran employee and was denied.  No set hours and no benefits for part time employees.  Expected to cover multiple departments for one set wage.  Minimal raises given out over 3 years of employment.  A good company to get experience and then walk away fast.
bad,Each day started out with challenges that needed to be addressed before the store opened to the public. I learned that a good management team makes a very big difference in the positive outlook for all of the employees. An employee starting out the day being positive can bring a great day for the public customer service experience. The hardest part of the job was not being heard from management when problems arose that needed to be addressed and were not. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public.
bad,"If you do not like working closely to customers, this is not the job for you. Must have good customer service experience, and be able to work in a fast paced environment."
bad,I have a disability n I felt discriminated n treated differently for it. They had on cashier n when they found out I had a disability they tried to give me a hard time by putting me to do difficult task
bad,"It’s very clicky. Especially, in the management positions. You feel more like a tool. Not a person. Almost everyone is demeaning there. The work atmosphere sucks. Customers can treat us however they want and we have to deal with it. Contractors groping female associates and nothing is done because they spend too much at the store. So an employees value and self worth is less than money? ASM’s are told not to help associates physically work and fill orders of need be. Store manager bragging about her bonus. Not having the proper PPE gear. It’s funny how nice ASMs and store managers are nice a month before the VOA’s. than money?"
bad,"Job was nothing like I envisioned, extremely understaffed and no support from management.  Customers were beyond rude. Only benefits that full-time received was the ability to work 40 hours per week. And don't you dare work even a half hour overtime, you will be written up for that."
bad,"I was so excited for this job, but there was little support from co-workers and I was quickly written off the schedule by co-workers, when the head scheduler/manager quit without notice.  I called the manager several times requesting hours and was promised hours, even full-time, but that never occurred."
bad,"This company is very passive aggressive with how they treat their employees, they threaten you if you confront them with issues . They Have very poor management."
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful and cutthroat because there's a lot of favoritisms and politicking. However, I always learn ne things from customers everyday at work and one positive of flexible work schedules though the place is totally disorganize, unsupportive, and unfriendly."
bad,"1) Management made the environment stressful every day. Store "
bad,"The pay is criminal.  If the customers that are helped in the aisles and at the registers knew how much starting pay is at HD, that'd be embarrassed for the employees.  No benefits. Childish ways of getting people motivated. Not enough help for customers. Reviews are unfair and untrue (an excuse for 3 and 5 cent raises. Raises are pathetic."
bad,"Burn the best of us by doing all the work."
bad,All employees are not treated fairly some employee can get buy with anything. Then by the book for others . Some people can be late and some people can't. Just depends
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone looking to advance into a career unless they are in their teens.  If you have 30 or 40 years to dedicate to the company you may be able to force your foot into the door of advancement.
bad,"Poor management, very strict attendance policy and insensitive to family issues. Had a death in family - I had most of the time to cover me for family member funeral but was  2 hours short.  I was fired because I did not have all the time available."
bad,The Associates are childish and managers are  disrespectful. They will give you occurrences for almost anything even if it's school related. I would only recommend this job if your really in need of a job.
bad,If you like being micromanaged then this is the job for you. Worked all holidays. Looks for reasons to get rid of associates that have been there 10 or more years so salary and benefits can be cut. Very unfair against older associates.
bad,"Tl;dr: Job varies between ""get paid to do virtually nothing"" tier, and ""apocalypse"" tier"
bad,Been a lot associate at Home Depot for a couple years now and my time with the company will be coming to a end soon. Management looks down on you and stunts any chance of advancement that is limited to begin with. After 3 years you'll make the same as a brand new hire. There used to be a solid store culture but it has gone downhill in recent years. Lots of cutbacks for basic employee perks. Benefits are decent if you can get into a full time position.
bad,too many thing to get pass this part of whatever this is. it seems to be point less to many letters required on something that really don't matter....
bad,Something that'll work out temporarily for you for about a month or 2 until you find out how trash the managers are. Would absolutely not recommend working for them tho
bad,"I'd love to inform all, I just cannot find the words. It was sad working there. Some of my co-workers were amazing and one person (Identity unknown)was incredibly generous buying sand bags as weight for my vehicle during my 1+ hour drive to work in the winter. I dedicate myself to every job & even when I totalled my blazer hitting a deer on my way to work, I still worked that day. I just wish they recognized my drive and placed me in other areas instead of just keeping me as a Greeter. The ""cliques"" that existed intimidated those who they didn't accept into their hateful groups and bullies hid with ""clique"" hats & managers' clothing."
bad,"* Bay maintenance"
bad,"The current level of Corporate Management at Home Depot favors younger applicants. It ignores the older, existing employees when they request additional training. The younger, new hires are immediately given cross-training in all departments. They discriminate against older employees."
bad,Outside sales selling cabinet refacing and closet organizers.  Very over priced. 50 percent of customers no call no show. Not allowed to verify appointments. No fuel pr mileage reimbursement straight commision.  Have to stand in home depot stores on your own time to get your own leads . It is so unorganized.  The managers and people at stores dont like you..  you are competing against them with higher priced items .. you receive no help or guidance. Worked for them twice 15 years separated.  I thought 15 years they have it together. Jo if anything it was worse...  horrible opportunity ..  home depot outside sales
bad,"When I started I was never shown around the store to find out where things were and was assigned to water plants for my full 6 hour shift in 55 and below degree weather for three days with no warning and when I was inside I was left alone with no directions on how to operate their phone device systems, expected to help customers, stock, unload freight and put up displays. They try to promote themselves as a place where everyone treats each other as family but when you ask someone for help or directions they look at you like you're crazy or have no time for you. I was very clear that I could not work sundays when they asked my schedule but they still assign me sundays and get upset and try to guilt me in to coming in."
bad,"The Home Depot has a vision for itself with a Value Wheel and something they call The Orange Promise. In theory, it should be a great company to work for, but they do not stand by those values they claim to hold dear."
bad,"At the current location, unless you were a female, Or in tight wth management advancement was little or none. Too much back biting, inactive management. At my former location, upper management was very weak."
bad,"Home Depot is a stressful place to work. During busy times of year, such as Christmas and summer, they offer hours and try to keep employees on the floor. However, if times are slow they cut hours and send employees home. "
bad,"most if not all associates are not payed fairly for the work they are tasked with. example if you run a forklift and a reach-lift even for x amount of years and you are a fairly skilled operator, your pay does not advance and you are expected to work even harder for minimum wage. despite the fact that you have been employed there for x amount of years. In conclusion if you like braking your back for a company for peanuts then this job is for you."
bad,"The pay compensation to work ratio is awful. The only thing they do well & often is to train you on safety; and that is to cover their backs and honestly nothing more. If it were employee related, they would compensate you better so that you can pay to have some occasional therapy to the aching body. They staff with 1 competent individual and the rest of them don't know what a hammer (exaggerated example) is. You do a good job with customers, move products (sales) and are knowledgeable and you get zero recognition or perks (better scheduling/pay). They used to offer the staff bottled water (free) and last I heard that was removed. Any interaction with a manager is only when you are doing something wrong that could potentially injure you or cost them money in a lawsuit. I can understand that, but give positive recognition as well. Managers tell you something absurd needs to be done, but if it can put them under scrutiny for ordering such a task; they'll simply word it in a way as to have you assume that you need to do it and then it falls upon as if it were your decision. In my decades of being in the workforce, I can say this much for my short experience with them; They're shady, ungrateful, inconsiderate and unfortunately I could keep adding more negativity, but will stop there. Only upside is, if you're a loafer on the job; then its easy to get away with it, until someone complains of course. In short this is not a company to work at for someone of good working ethics. This is not the HD I grew-up admiring in the early 80's."
bad,"They lie when they hire you!!  raises do not keep pace with inflation, low pay , bonuses work out to about $40 per 1/2 year, management and hr are terrible (they get rid of the good ones asap). It is a good place to work if you are under 20 or over 65 but if you are trying to support a family and/or pay a mortgage forget the home depot!!!"
bad,This is very good company to work for if you are hard worker and like to stand very long hours. And also like to do. Hands work moving lifting and bending
bad,"I worked at home depot for 2 years total. I was promised a lot of things that never came to fruition. People who were terminated were treated better than people that were retained. They just dropped their roofing, siding, and gutter products out of the blue. This cut my personal income in half. They terminated 1/2 of their sales force. They cut the poor performers and new people, and gave them a $20,000 severance package. The people who were lucky enough to “keep” their jobs were left to fend for themselves and make due with 50% of their income. I wish I had been fired....at least I would have had the time (and money) to find a new job. On paydays we jokingly called it “mystery Friday” as we never knew what we would get paid or when. Our bonuses were at best arbitrary and often they missed cutoffs seemingly on purpose to short the salespeople. I fought it constantly. They did not care. It was the most stressful job of my career. In addition to all of that the customers were often left unsatisfied with the quality of work. Management could not help."
bad,Home depot warehouse was a job where they expect a lot from an employee but never recognized a hard working individual. A lot of people in charge were not recognized and where only put in better positions depending on who the knew.
bad,"The people you work with are very nice. You make friendships. Management needs a lot of work. They hire friends with no experience and move them up before those that have been with the company for years. Management refuses to talk to the customer when they are complaining and leave it to the associate to fix the problem, but gets written up for doing out of the way to keep the customer. Management, also, would make the associate look bad after the associate applied the Home Depot rules and standards to correct a problem with a customer, by agreeing with the wrong answer supplied by the customer. Customer service was the hardest place to work in the entire store. You felt abandoned by those who were supposed to be running the store."
bad,"This job was challenging, Some people were helpful others weren't"
bad,Not enough hours and not enough pay. If your a cashier you also have to do restocking and returns and push credit cards on customers and if you don’t get X amount of credit cards a week your hours for next week drop
bad,"home depot was the worst place I ever worked at. it wasn't the tasked I was doing ,cause i'm good at multi tasking it was the management, they treated me like I was a 2 year old child. I do not appreciate being belittled in front of my co-workers."
bad,"Store Managers consistently made their own rules and often changed them without notifying staff. Harassment from assistant managers, promoting is inconsistent and unfair. It is not by corporate guidelines. Once you start making “decent “ $$ or if you have any opinions you will be Terminated they will make it up if they have to. The best thing about it is the crew who is honest and actually works and becoming a family. Others are moles for management. It has potential to be great the idea of structure from corporate is awesome but it just is not being carried out. "
bad,The company is stable but you will be worked for long extensive hours. Work and life balance is minimal and considering the hours you will be working it doesn't suffice for the pay for salary employees.
bad,"Despite the unfortunate numbers, my supervisors were  very pleasant. I made some good friends but most of them were unhappy with their own jobs. That negetivity was a bit overwhelming."
bad,New employees started off at the same pay when I had already earned multiple raises. After two years of working for them i ended up with the same pay as a two day old employee.
bad,"You have no set schedule, your weeks are set based on what they need at the time. some days your flying solo in your department and the additional work on top of helping customers becomes almost impossible so you find yourself frantically rushing to get it all done at the end of the day. Helping customers is what it is some folks are nice other are not, that's the life clench your teeth and smile. there also the tricks they play with your hours to prevent from having to make you full time lots of 40 hour weeks then one random 38 hour one."
bad,Company works like this. You are a cog in a machine that turns money upwards. They preach you are the most important individual. A tool. So many instances of lies and mis information. Fuzzy math. Egotistical management.
bad,"This is for the previous Home Depot I worked at. Poor management, they do not care about you because you are only a pawn in their game of chess. They load you with work other people are supposed to do but dont do because they know they will get away with it and the next person coming in will have to clean up after them. You need to ASK for APPRECIATION, because if you don't your hard work will be overseen and nobody will even give you a ""good job""."
bad,"If you were military, they want you, but no matter what kind of leadership course, job, skills, they will place you in the parking lot pushing carts. They promise you advancement, but after a year, I was still in the parking lot."
bad,"I started there not knowing anything about hardware retail and I did learn a fair amount about it and the people in those departments were quick to answer questions I had along with customer questions."
bad,"I worked there a total of two and a half years, starting part-time, 22-38 hours/week, and when I quit I was full-time. Starting salary was $9/hour in 2015, ending with $11 and 40 hours/week in 2018 (I didn't get full-time until about January 2018). I have anxiety, so my short commute was an exercise in deep breathing and prayer to God that I wouldn't be sent to the returns department, and if I was, that people would be nice and I would have no reason to melt down ( because I guess it's the industry standard for management not to support their employees when people have no sympathy, patience, understanding or decency when they're screaming at you for their money because they broke the drill). I was only slightly less anxious if I wasn't in returns because it's pretty easy to get yourself fired. A friend and former co-worker was fired for telling a racy joke. Another co-worker was fired for giving money from self-checkout to the wrong customer. Anybody could've made those mistakes. And management presses you to keep an eye on every single person because the holidays are a time for giving, receiving and also theft. People got angry when I needed to open and check a box that's supposed to be a gift, but I could've easily been fired if the one box I don't check had a stolen power saw inside. That made it an incredibly stressful place for me to work because I always felt like I was walking a strict tightrope in a place where the rules are always changing, you have to keep both eyes on a million people at once and you might get a 25 cent raise every six months up from $10."
bad,Stressful work environment where supervisors and managers rarely look out for their associates. Working overnight you will not be noticed by the store manager or most of the daytime assistant managers. Supervisors do a poor job training associates and it falls on more experienced associates to train and help meet the needs of newer associates. It will take an assistant manager requesting the store manager to put in for a decent one-time pay raise above and beyond the small annual raise to get a decent wage.
bad,I have no comment.  they do not treat employees fairly.  For similar tasks some employees are paid higher than others (5-7 dollars more per hour).  company does not practice what it preaches.  Cannot talk to higher management-Store manager is it.
bad,This company is great if you love to kiss butt. Your hard work means nothing here if you have a manager who just doesn't like you. That manager can simply ruin your whole life with absolutely no repercussions. If you get promoted and nobody can figure out why....beware. They do this as a tactic to have a reason to fire you. Nobody at HD is your friend. Snakes find snakes here. Always watch your back.
bad,Average part-time job for High School Students. Schedule wasn't flexible. Pay was not competitive. Very strict rules. Many ways to get written and fired.
bad,"Tough place to work. Management was not receptive to hearing employee ideas to make for a better working environment. Constant employee turnover of best people for many reasons, including terrible compensation."
bad,I do not recommend this company at all.  They don't care about thier employees like they should.  Every employee can get fired no matter how long youve been there.  This one guy was 12 months from retiredment they found a reason to let him go.   Good for kids but not adults
bad,You don't get paid enough for the work they make you do. Don't expect to advance in this company.  I've been trying to get full time for 3 years. I learned the whole store and all the machines and I'm not getting full time. Crazy.
bad,"I worked at two different stores in my area over roughly a 4-year timeframe. It's an ok job that only had two things I liked about it.  One, I was in a hardware store (I love DIYing stuff), two, the coworkers I had in both stores were overall pretty cool.  Other than that, there's a lot of cons.  The pay is ok, I got better pay than I would have at a few other retailers, but my pay barely improved.  The initial training teaches a culture of the company listening to their employees’ suggestions and other great stuff I never saw happen, so I see the company as hypocritical.  When I was interested in moving to a different department and expressed that interest, many times, the managers would rather hire someone new and pay them less than hire from within and promote.  There are no benefits.  You must be full time to get benefits, but you must work part time first, and they rarely promote from inside the store to full time positions.  Each store can be very different based on the managers at that store.  I had one store that was very political when it came to hiring and moving people from one department to another.  The last store I worked at ended up losing the department supervisor and so I ended up filling his shoes and fulfilling the roles of three people for several weeks.  When I asked the management to hire more people for the department, they told me that wasn’t how it worked, but the “appreciated” all the work I was doing.  After 6 weeks of this, I had to quit because I couldn’t take the stress anymore."
bad,"Made to work overtime, but when it came to Monday morning they told me that they couldn't pay me overtime, they weren't  authorized so I wasn't able to see my childrens school concert, and then not paid for my time spent there."
bad,Fasted laced environent. Extremely hot. Epj/ forklift required to work at 80% of the warehouses tasks/ subdivisions. Sustained me for two 1/2 years. Won value award associate of the month in may 2017. Great experience for warehouse criteria.
bad,"Some other associates are awesome but management has favorites. If you and that person have a similar situation, or whatever, you get a write up and they get a slap on the wrist"
bad,It was overall a good experience but I did have a bad experience with two of the managers. Everybody else loved me and I loved them. The hiring manager was a wonderful person and so was the store manager.
bad,"lack of help in my department makes most days stressful and tiring. things take time beacuse of all the safety rules in place and customers get mad having to wait , we dont have enough people trained on the fork truck"
bad,"I did enjoy it at first but management makes it hard to still love. They treat you differently if you have limitations, they only care about making themselves look good in front of upper management"
bad,"The people that worked there was very nice,  human resource was unavailable  or would not return calls when you had a question or a problem. Would not change your schedule if it became a problem or if  you wanted to change positions."
bad,Need to meet your quota on sales   warranties  credit cards and loans they expect you to answer phones while doing kitchen designs for the customer in front of you and other customer are waiting.
bad,My opinion of this place is that they are only worried about themselves when they do not even give their employee's discounts at the store I could go on but that's not what this is about so with that I am done.
bad,"Always hiring but cannot provide hours to the people they already have hired. Only keep people who do nothing but bring the company down and ruin the job for those who do it. In time of need the managers will not help you. Arriving on time to work and being on the floor a few minutes in advance, and staying late. They will not work with your school schedule. They will not take into any consideration what the employees suggests even if accommodations are within reason."
bad,"Working here was a nightmare. Sometimes I was lucky to have even 20hrs of work for the week. The pay was horrible. Standing for long periods of time and constantly being talked down by customers was the worse. Management would practically let customers steel from them because ""the customer is always right."""
bad,"I would not recommend working at The Home Depot. The pay is low, raises are pitiful (mine was 34 cents, and I worked there 3 years), too many politics, managers have a condescending, bad attitude, coverage was awful; So often new associates are left to fend for themselves. Overall, a bad experience."
bad,Had you Do different jobs without training Did not give raises overtime was not allowed Lets you to deal with customers on your own management was too busy to help out
bad,"It is to hot in the summer, no air conditioners on site."
bad,"A typical day was come in and check your inventory"
bad,"Management only sees dollar signs when they look at you, they don't look at the hard working employees any different than they look at the slackers who are just there to collect a tiny pay check.  Benefits are available, but are expensive!!!  You don't get paid for the hard work that you put in.  No appreciation."
bad,I worked there for a year and tried to advance a million times but upper management didn't need new managers they need cart pushers and people to push the other stuff on. Upper management is why I left
bad,"A decent first job for recent high school graduates. Starting pay can be several dollars above minimum wage, raises vary and are based on yearly reviews."
bad,Home Depot was a great place to start my career path. They have good benefits and great employees to work with. Home Depot did build me for future employment and changed my look on the world and people to work in the customer service.
bad,"although it was nice starting out, but getting to know the biz the more you find out how unfair it is for the employees.I work in lumber currently as the closer, working 6 days in a row and never off 2 consecutive days.  Raises are not anything to get excited about, my last raise was .35 cents and I was really working my butt off.  Accruing personal time is 2 hours per 80 hours of work which is bizzare, basically 2 hours a month, god forbid you get sick, you worked 3 months to take that sick day off..."
bad,"It's ok to work here if you need something to do, are still in school, or if retired and need something to keep you busy. "
bad,"overall uncaring managers, very arrogant, not knowledgeable in company HR rules and regs.Management is by threat and intimidation.  Workers too often accused of wrongdoing without any evidence whatsoever."
bad,"Poor management in some stores, no communication, lazy supervisors, only thing corporate cared about was shareholder value, NOT associates as they try to tell everyone!! Very questionable accounting practice by the whole company. NO aprons on the floor as they so preach to everyone. They have lost there ways!!"
bad,"I was there under a contract firm that did not want to pay me for the work I did. They did after I threaten to leave and file EEOC. They gave me an opportunity to return but I declined. The management at Home Depot did not care, and had no issues with me leaving. I will not return. Bell Soft + Ho Depot IS SCUM"
bad,Home Depot does not have a great deal of consideration for it's employees.  The management changes rapidly (3 store managers in the 5 1/2 years I was there).  Assistant managers have no regard for employees.
bad,"Sales associates are now required to be on call for ""Same Day Appointments"" you do not know your calendar in advance to plan your day or week. Your appointments are set at 50 miles away from your home and they keep you on the road outside of your area with NO Milage reimbursement. Most of the seasoned salesmen are looking to leave, which may be the strategic plan of Home Depot. Bonus commissions have been cut and salaries are getting reduced by spending more time on the road, than face to face with customers. The upper management stays oblivious to the turmoils that their salesforce are facing."
bad,The store managers and assistant managers are never on the same page. Each is always pushing their own ideas upon the associates. This complicates things. Meaning the associates end up doing the same task at least 4 times. They constantly play games with schedules. This week you could be written up for 15 minutes of overtime while next week you're expected to put in a 60+ hour week... Stressful and frustrating
bad,"Home Depot is a terrible place to work. They want you to work and go above and beyond but when you need something its a dilemma. "
bad,"Standard entry level customer service position. Angry customers to deal with, poor management, limited advancement and pay increases, difficult policies for scheduled work and attendance. They do give you three weeks off on vacation, but must be scheduled far in advance."
bad,"very hard place to work at , very of the wall hours lots of week end and holiday work without time and a half morning shifts night shifts hours got pushed around alot, dont even get an employee discount ."
bad,"Work is too hard and too dangerous for the pay. 105 lb kid outside throwing 80lb bags of concrete into a truck? Sure, why not."
bad,loved the people. management needs to learn to relate to people on a personal level. Expectations are too far fetched. Need relatable discounts and more affordable insurance.
bad,"The Home Depot doesn't really care about its employees but hides behind building profit to mask that it's a terrible place to work.  It used to be that if you got a job here, you were set for awhile with a pretty good job.  In recent years, however, the culture has become toxic and cut throat.  Older more knowledgeable associates are frustrated with the ineptitude of management, while management promotes younger associates to department supervisor level, selling the idea that running a multi-million dollar department can be done with limited resources."
bad,"I had previously been a vendor for home depot before the store manager gave me a job on the spot. At first i loved my store. Then i realized how much drama and micromanagement went on. The management all had their favorites. I met my now husband there, so I giess one good thing came from it. I was promoted from cashier to head cashier within 4 months because the manager of the front end somewhat liked me. The pay was decent, but the benefit cost are outrageous! I quit when I found a better job. I watched people get fired for ridiculous reason and false accusations with no evidence of it happening. I would never recommend this place. I always felt like I was walking back into high school."
bad,"dont plan on fairness in the work place, asked to move positions for 3 years and they are forcing someone to leave their position they love instead of letting me move."
bad,Management had an selected few of favorites that got an great opportunity so with that being said I obviously wasn't the favorite so I had a career change
bad,Bad management they was very mean they yelled and heard they was stealing money from people they got in my face and yelled they don't do any work there
bad,management sucks and alot of racial profiling from department heads and when you talk to management about it they never do anything about any issues or concerns you voice.
bad,go in in work 4 hour sent home to repeat sometime you close and then go back in the next morning to reopen the store! We have had a few good manager in my time.
bad,"Local support is below average, working manager is not very experienced and is not very supportive. Equipment is the only plus to working here. They do offer a decent benefits package."
bad,Made a lot of friends working at Home Depot. Only downside is we bonded in mutual distaste for working at Home Depot. Management frequently changes and is very disconnected from the work force itself.
bad,"The only time I would look to work at Home Depot, to help support a household, was if I was working in a managerial position. Other than that, just starting out with the company you're only going to get part time hours and the benefits suck as a part time employee."
bad,"Hours are horrible and while the company continues to make record profits, most people work less hours and make little to no money.  Get ready to take a ton of nonsense from customers and then be forced to bow down to them."
bad,Very stressful on how the higher up want to put more on the lower ladder workers but then don't pay them what other companies in same line of business
bad,Thoroughly did not enjoy my time at this establishment. Managers kept making unrealistic demands of me to the point of missing a family member's funeral despite going through the formal channels.
bad,I had went to management on another associate making profanity qoutes and was told to suck it up and don't be a ..... And I then told my DM and she said she would talk to management and the next thing I know we both we fired
bad,Great part time job for a college student but not for a person looking for a career.  Definitely not the company it was 20 years ago. Knowledge not needed
bad,I worked overnight shifts as the night freight manager. My team was understaffed and constantly having hours cut because the day shift was over hours. Management was disorganized and had poor communication.
bad,"Knowledge is not valued . Will hire young people and advance them and pay higher, over Older more experienced people . Despite outselling, out working, and earning more of the company awards including Presidential award for customer service.  "
bad,"This is great for someone to start. not recommended for a professional. enjoyed the challenge of explaining to customers benefits of doing their own projects, selling the right tool to do the job."
bad,"This store promises a lot, but delivers rarely. Communication between management and associates is lacking. Favorites are picked and treated differently. Too much like a soap opera."
bad,being on time to work and consistent on duties and customers. learned how to manage multiple customers at once when no back up. comfortable working in fast pace environment. Hardest part of the job is when you get no feed back on the work you are doing. Most enjoyable part of the job is watching customers leave with a smile on their face because you were able to help with their problem.
bad,"They wanted me to do to many things along with my job. I was supposed to sell and design kitchen, cabinets, counter top, vanities, and sell appliances, plumbing and many different stuff."
bad,Working at Home Depot wasn't the best choice. You start out at the bottom regardless of your experience. Management is self-centered. Schedule was consistently undetermined. There was no plan for employees that called in sick.
bad,"This is simply a place to work while you are in school or if you just need a temporary job. This is not a place for people looking for a long term job. This company doesn't not invest in it's employees, yearly raises are about $0.15 and good luck if you are trying to move up."
bad,The Home Depot is not the place you want to work for if you are looking to advance in the corporate world. The company does not give you any tools necesssary for growth and advancement.
bad,"They do not work with your family life, they do not work with school schedules and if they do they toss a fit about it. Management seem to care more about what they want then how their employees feel/what they needed."
bad,Started off as a good place to work..But then wasnt getting any hours..And if I did it was weird hours..Low pay..Probally had to work there a longer time to recieve full time or more benefits
bad,I loved working at home depot at first. But only because the people you work with made it worth being there. Management sucks and you dont get paid enough to either be hit on or yelled at by customers. your hours blow. you either have a 4 hour day or a 6 hour day up too 8 but it only ever equals out to be 20 hours a week. Not worth the drive. At home depot you have to be favored to be noticed. you can put in all the hard work you want but it will never matter if they dont like you.
bad,"On a typical day, I experienced working with a good group of individuals with the hopes of being able to move up to different location to learn something new. I was able to learn about different departments and merchandise that was in the store. It just was hard to move up with little recognition from your superiors. I enjoyed working with associates of different backgrounds. The hardest part of this job is not being able to help  the customers as much as I would have liked to. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was meeting different people of different backgrounds and being able to help them and communicate with them."
bad,"Terrible management, scheduling is a nightmare, they expect you to do the work of 3 people in a very short time frame. The only positive thing I can say about working here is that the hours are flexible, UNLESS it interferes with them of course."
bad,this was a good place to work but there are to many bosses telling you what to do and each manager tells you to do things different so you are constantly being pulled into different directions so your never sure what to do
bad,I used to love coming to work at the home depot all the associates are so nice and welcoming. But the management is hands down the worst ive ever seen they have managers running departments that they have no clue anything about whenever you need help nobody is around its honestly pathetic how little you get paid. 99% of the time everybody is running around with their heads chopped off
bad,"I was only employed for Home Depot for a short time while I think the major issue was just poor management no supervision while I was there not sure why ,"
bad,"A typical day is clock in go on a register and ring , get one 15 min break for 6 hr shift or 1 hour lunch and a 15 min break for a full 8 hrs. it was nice when i was in high school and early college they are flexible with your schedule , full timers have set schedules in some stores may vary. As a part timer there are no benefits what so ever besides paid vacation and two hours of sick time per month so make sure you accumulate those. No dental, vision "
bad,"Cut throat, office politics were awful.  This was a corporate buyout of a great cash-cow business.  Once HD got their hands on the business and the grandfathered benefits were removed, the business sank..... Literally.  They offered relocation when they moved the warehouse and sales center to GA, which I did not take, but then they closed the doors in GA and laid off all employees that did follow them.  Horrible"
bad,"Management is bad none are trained in there departments they manage, a lot of favoritism no team help work for yourself. moral is always down and bad.  don't Get paid enough for the responsibility's you are in charge of. mutable safety hazards ignored against OSHA   requirements."
bad,"poor communication, lack of trust and employee driven, low  moral in the store poor scheduling, management unprofessional. poor raises. poor leadership, not ran like a fortune 500 company."
bad,"i worked there for three years offering all I could and learning. Unfortunately due to a poor management team, after three years there was no point in staying there so i moved on to the next part of my life."
bad,"I have worked full time for The Home Depot for nearly three years now, and have cross-trained in about five or six different positions, and even having much appreciation from many other people, including management, they seem to favor few people. Also I've received very little in terms of raises, especially moving into new departments. I've changed positions officially three times, and each move was ""lateral,"" even though I've gained more responsibility each time. I recommend THD if you are in school, or retired. Can't say I'd recommend as a career. Unless you are okay with constantly pleasing wrong and rude customers, standing on your feet on concrete for 8 hours a day, and not getting support from your management, because more than likely they are not trained in your department to help you."
bad,"This job would be good for a college student who needs a part time source of income while going to school. Management was terrible while I was employed here, but since I left new management has been established."
bad,But the people who work in this store are rude and the pay was a joke. And then to top it off they don't even have the guts to tell me when they are not going to make my job permanent. If you are going to let me go tell me instead of choosing to not give me a schedule for 3 weeks. Cowardly if you ask me
bad,"Home Depot is not a bad place to work and has a few good benefits. Overall for what is required of you is a good customer interaction. "
bad,"I first began as a part timer in the lumber department. My coworkers were experienced, productive and helpful. it was my first experience in a retail job and it was relatively pleasant. In fact, I was awarded sales associate of the month after my first full month."
bad,"The company may be good on a corporate level but, the store level need alot of work. in my time there i realized that the management does not take ownership of their departments or their employees."
bad,"There is no place for designers to design with out being on the sales floor. The company gives plenty of computer training but no communication , when your done with computer training your put on the floor to sink or swim . "
bad,"I've been here almost 3 years and it's by far the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,I was going to school full time while working at the Home Depot. They would never work with my schedule causing me stress to get to work from school and the manager would always use favoritism when rewarding others.
bad,"local and district managers didn,t want to take care of problem employees they just figured to bad you deal with them. even though managegment had multiple complaints from employees and customers about a employee."
bad,Good job if you only need supplemental income.   Many associates stand around talking all day.  Favoritism. ................................................
bad,"Management does not care about their employees. There is blantly favoritism. Their promotional process is a joke. They only promote people they like on a personal level. You're pushed to get credit cards, but no matter how many you get, you are still disposable to them. Basically, you're working while the people they like get to sit around and hang out at self check out."
bad,"Over worked and tired. I under stand that a company so large as this wants to continue to grow.  We'll you  making more money isn't more important than my safety or my work life balance. "
bad,"its a cool job to work you learn a lot of different things , "
bad,pretty hard to say everything wrong working here. the biggest thing is the hours. one day you 8 -5 am next day you may work 2-10 pm. you work most weekends never had a Saturday in two yrs.had to quit going to church because all the Sundays you had to work so many different hours.and part time was a joke the way they schedule your hrs you could not get any other job.
bad,"IF you are ready to follow orders without question. Fill quotes to move up regardless if they hurt co workers, and can step on someone to get up the ladder. Then this is the place for you"
bad,They are very stats oriented and you have to be friends with upper management in order to advance there. If you are really good at your job and management doesn't like you then you will remain in your position
bad,Very bad work environment. Understaffed and always overworked for each shift. Raises are given at a minimal and employees aren't given everything to succeed at their position.
bad,There is room for advancement working at Home Depot.  The pay is horrible. You cannot life off the pay check. I love working with people and helping people as they come in and find what they need always puts a smile on my face. The hardest part of the job is that  management does not recognize the good employees.  There is a lot of favoritism in the store and there is no job security there.
bad,"co workers were rude and entitled. the harrdest part of the job was when id do what im supposed to, then get told i didnt do it that happened everyday"
bad,"If you've got no education or training, HD is the next best thing to otherwise enlisting in the military."
bad,"Hey its home depot what more is there to say. You clock in, do your work and leave. Simple as that. warehouse sales environment very busy on the weekends. Usually hire a lot of staff for seasonal garden department in April."
bad,The pay at this job was alright but the management and the organization was bad. They had old school techniques the should have been updated a long time ago and their safety techniques were not up to par. I regret working at this conpany.
bad,"Not a very good experience working with Ivy Acres, the management is highly biased and there is many disagreements between managers and area supervisors, the directions go back and forth when it comes to store design and product set-up and sales which affects the workers. The starting salary is decent and above minimum wage, however, as previously informed when starting with the company, workers are supposed to receive a $0.50 raise each season while working with the company, but managers and upper level employees for the company found every reason to restrict raises. In my 4 years of working there I have gotten one raise. Work is sometimes also unappreciated."
bad,"Pay is terrible."
bad,I did not really like working for home depot. They ask too much for such little pay. I worked overnight and they paid me dirt money. They do not deserve hard working people. Very unappreciative!
bad,Not willing to give lateral position not willing to take pay cut my services no longer needed exstremly understaffed poor customers service not willing to work with employees. Extremely volatile atmosphere when stating opinion to management i would not suggest or expose anyone to business
bad,"poor advancement of unqualified associates."
bad,"They like to slave you but don't like to pay you."
bad,Lots of Nice people trying to buy nice house. Nice traveling.Something new every day. Also something new everyday.. Good food sometimes..
bad,Constantly looking at my schedule to see that I have been taken off a day or that I have zero hours some weeks. Always changing. And when I do get scheduled it is outside of my availability.
bad,"Management was a mess, no structure or balance when giving breaks."
bad,Short staff no full time position no hours health ins to expensive no future. For being a billion dollar company we have no full timers only foe dept head and managers.
bad,"I thought this was a place that you could have longevity within the company Three years working for this company I was highly disappointed with its scheduling, management staff, and people not doing their job. I enjoyed working with most people but there were some that just wasn't working up to their expectations. Short staff, overworked, and high turn over rate of people working  and quitting in a few days of hiring. It made it hard for the ones who were dedicated to working and meeting the job expectancies."
bad,"This is an ok place to work. Mangement sucks. The supervisors have favorites and don't know how to talk to people correctly. They wait until the last minute to do things and fail to tell employees to do tasks until the last minute. Some supervisors are lazy and hardly do anything, but walk around the building all day or either hide in the breakroom, receiving, or the training room. "
bad,"Horrible place to work... "
bad,Freight is not the most fun job to do .. the wage is low to low to feed your family and you are part time which may only include 1 day a week off season. It is all who you know there
bad,"I generally believe that anyone in a management position should know how to run any other position/department in their store, or at least know what is required of those positions.  "
bad,"Overall my experience was good, but I did not see any room to expand in their ranks, and I was not receiving the hours I needed. My co-workers were overall very personable and friendly, I got along well with everyone. However, there were some that I felt did not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to help someone find what they needed and leave our store happy."
bad,"Associates are tasked to help customers, however some bad managers don't support there teams, advancement can be tricky"
bad,"This could be a great job but it hasn't changed since they started in the home selling business.  Growth has been flat.  They hire 25 new sales consultants each week.  The retention is low due to disconnect between the stores and Home Depot Exteriors.  The Divisional Directors have not been Sales Consultants and don't have a realistic plan for improvement.  "
bad,"The Home Depot as a corporate could be the job of our dreams if they wanted it to be that way, that is of course. "
bad,bad managment and scheduling and co workers are not trained well at all. new hires are paid 12 while people who have been there for 6 years are paid 12
bad,"Loved working with contractors and vendors, my sales were always in the top of district. No appreciation or support from management."
bad,Departments lack coverage sometimes. It is senseless to gripe about a place of employment because things are seldom fixed.
bad,"A typical day at work, completing customer's transactions. I learned you can assist even the most difficult customer. Management was bias (Had to be apart of the ""fit/click"" Some of my co-workers were genuinely willing to assist. The hardest part of the job's is not enough hours available at certain locations.  The most enjoyable part was the customer's acknowledging your great service performed."
bad,Management at my store was horrible. This store had a high turnover. Not alot of employees stayed longer than 3 months because of management.
bad,"Very labor based company. No job security, no lee-way on scheduling. Forced training, and very cult like. High turnover rate, most don't last longer than 2 months."
bad,"Not much to do as a cashier. Just stand and wait for customers to choose your lane to come through. Stay friendly and helpful for all customers. In need of more hours, or full time."
bad,The Management at the store I worked at did not know the meaning of communication. The Store Manager was nice but spent too much time in his office. The HR Manager has no sweet clue how to do her job or who to send you to in order to get your question answered.
bad,After 8 years of employment and very tense days I am no longer employed there. The management is encouraged to pad their numbers with understaffing and overworking what staff they do have. Compensation is not enough to live on and the company is employing over 60% part time so they can avoid paying benefits. Part time employees are limited to 29 hours or under and overtime for anyone is not paid but made to be cut at your lunch hour. The only saving grace for this place is the people who actually work there. Most first level associates are dedicated and knowledgeable.
bad,The over all environment at home depot was set more on a day to day basis with the management being lack luster all the time. The day was more determined on the customers if you could answer the questions they presented.
bad,A typical day at home depot starts like every other. We have a set schedule and do the same things every day. Theirs a lot of lifting and hard work involved which is the most frustrating part you work a lot for not that much pay. The most enjoyable part is the people which are friendly and caring
bad,"Excellent Customer Service skills including; developing oneonone"
bad,That I do not have too much time and I have to finish the morning shift work which they didn`t finish it in addition that I have to scan every and each single item that I receive at my shift which might need more time.
bad,The store manager and the management team can either make you a happy employee or a very unhappy employee.  Dont plan on having a life while working here.  My husband had emergency open heart surgery and I was penalized for missing work for 3 days.  Watch your supervisors...they may tell you it is okay for you to be off and sign the paperwork approving. You will still be penalized.  I also put in for time off in August for my vacation to spend Thanksgiving with my son aamily ànd my request was denied.  I have been exposed to carbon oxide poisoning nearly passing out..they just got me outside they don't want anyone filing workers comp claims because they will loose money for the pizza parties.  When I got some thing in my eye causing an abrasion to my cornea...they... Management... Began harassing me.  Denying time off   ..I filed a workers comp claim after leaving work to have my eye checked.  I have also seen employees suffer from heat stroke..bad bad cuts from broken toilets...management doesnt take care to make sure employees are taken care of..just gets them to their cars and sends themm home.  Kids dont know they need to file a workers comp claim.Also if you quit them..they will not hire you back.  I can't recommend this company if you have any kind of life.u7
bad,Hard company to work for in regards to acceptance of availability. It was very hard to get along with people. I learned so many things about DIY projects and the different products we had to offer. Some of my coworkers are great to work with and make the shifts go by easier. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the chance to meet so many veterans and thank them for their service.
bad,"Since our current Store Manager and an Assistant Store Manager started working at this store, the morale and reliability of management has gone down considerably.  With the promotion of a new Front End Supervisor, the environment with the cashiers and Head Cashiers has become hostile on the Supervisor's part.  There is no room for error; if you make an error with this particular Supervisor, you get written up, even with the new cashiers or Head Cashiers who are still learning their position.  If you try to explain you are still learning, this supervisor states ""That's no excuse."""
bad,they have certain times that its busy 10am-3pm then its nothing. You just stand and wait for customersThere wasn't a lot of african american employees. A lot of mismanaging and miscommunication. I wouldn't say I learned anything new as far as my retail/ customer service career goes.
bad,typical day is setting bays and assisting customers. Management is barely ever at the store or on time and many of the associates dont seem to be too fond of them. MET coworkers make the job fun and go by quicker. We work for vendors not the store so it doesn't really apply to us. Our supervisor on the other hand is very professional but still lets us do what we have to
bad,"Working here is not difficult overall, but has its challenging moments. Management is inconsistent in how they follow up on issues, with associates and with the public. Many rules of conduct, even of simple respect, are not dealt with quickly or consistently. "
bad,You have to start off at part-time. They will tell you lies until they are done with you. Very unorganized company and management does not give you support or direction. You do not want to work there.
bad,"Money is fair, can be a fun place to work but store has to have the right manager and District Manager.  Most stores in area went downhill when new district manager came in and replaced most Store Managers.  I dont understand how a Store Manager can be fired the day after handing out awards for the quarter when our store placed 2nd in the entire district in performance.  "
bad,"This company is very hard to work for, The balance to work and home is very work and no life. The pay is good. We had many times from upper management supply rules of the week and by the next week something different"
bad,"Terrible Management in-store and completely unreliable/untrustworthy.  Too much favoritism given to employees employeed for more than 3yrs.  New employees are treated as espendable and poorly treated(daily).  The hardest part of the job is, excessive amounts of lifting, as well as dealing with poorly trainee dept. supervisors and having to work both indoors and outdoors in all types of weather."
bad,"Advancement, at the Orange box, is all about who is sleeping with who, or who has the hots for who. Experience does not come into play when it comes to advancement. Front end supervisor has NO CLUE how to operate a register or operate special services. Department head over shipping and receiving, Has no clue how to do anything is that department. Pay is ok, Benefits are good."
bad,"Matamoras is a very unorganized store. Management focuses on all the wrong problems. Pay is not good, though they think moving everybody up to 9.00/hour is good, but compared to the rest of the store associates, it sucks. Trying to get off the front end is impossible. They won't let anybody move from it, keeping cashiers is impossible because everybody quits. Lunches and breaks are always late. They tend to forget about you sometimes, especially if they stick you out in garden. Scheduling is not good, they don't care if you have family or priorities, they will schedule you to work every holiday. If you don't come in with set availability, good luck getting it changed. They will stick you with closing shifts every night of the week and don't care. Not happy with this place."
bad,"Not gonna write a review on my former to only have it posted on the internet. The Home Depot was a good company when they hired full timers but ever since they only hire part time, its rough."
bad,"High volume retailer specializing in home repair and renovations. It is an organization that is driven to service the customer, and to make sure they are fully satisfied. They make an effort to go the extra mile."
bad,Poor communication and no direction from management. Must communicate with fellow workers to figure out which way to go.
bad,"Worked in a high volume store stocking shelves overnight. I got along well for 2 years, before my supervisor was canned over politics. I stuck it out for a while after that because I loved my team-mates. I had to change my schedule when I started going to college, and was set up to self terminate. "
bad,I had love working there until they were expanding extra money was coming through and new managers. Overall it was very easy job scheduling customers for someone to come to their house and give them options and prices about changing their bathroom or kitchen refacing. And every sells we made we get bonus until they changed that we gotta make a certain percentage to get the bonus that we made. The only thing I miss about working there is meeting new people that came from different background and having a blast with them and getting paid every week which also the pay suck $10 dollars an hour really!!!
bad,pushing cart all day and helping client to the car . helping client all day
bad,"A typical day was extremely busy, not only working with the customers, but putting away stock, daily inventories of out of stock items."
bad,The is a lot of face to face interactions. They offer a lot training but you must make time to take it. There are at least five different managers and maybe 12 supervisors in one building. Co-workers are usually nice and easy to get a long with. The hardest part is the scheduling the store opens at 6a.m and closes at 10 p.m. I enjoyed the people the most the customer were great and we had a great staff.
bad,"MET is a team oriented merchandising process.  Typically, we will rotate through all departments in two weeks and repeat the cycle.  We participate in resets, adding/deleting shelf products and verify POP is current and undamaged."
bad,"All performance reviews are based on metrics that are beyond your control, such as obtaining a certain number of measure sales per shift. There is constant pressure to make sales."
bad,"I loved working at Home Depot. I did find that in our small town it was apparent that if you did not know someone then you were never going to move up. If an upper manager/supervisor did not like you, you were doomed. I did like the same level staff and the customers. People coming into a HD are either repairing or upgrading. Either way I was able to help people and give great customer service."
bad,"an okay job for my first not great always busy with afternoon rush very limited staff, as a cashier supervisors would change me from station to station where ever I'm needed always had to cover some ones else shift"
bad,"I was a sales assc. in the flooring department.  My duties included, sales, customer service and stocking the shelves."
bad,"sales customer service, good co workers, solving customer concerns.  lack of good management."
bad,bad management.their not far to most people no way to move up .the pay is upsetting and it bad when you have more exi then some one eles and they get pay more than you and when you ask to move to a other department and they say they will then never do they just hire new people for that job and not interview you at the time.i starting off loving my job but now after every thing that has happen their no now it just a job i have to do to live.and theirs alot more i can go on about but i think i need to stop. am just tried of not be treated right .but still love the company but just not that place .
bad,Working at Home Depot made me dislike that store entirely. There in hardly any ability to grow in the company. There was no management that was compatible with the co-workers. The blame was always put on the night shift.
bad,My experience with Home Depot was demanding.  I learned to work without supervision and assistance.  I did hone my ability to multi task and follow up with associates and the tasks assigned to them.  The management at my Home Depot is inconsistent at the best but that makes for associates that are able to adapt.  That is the most difficult part of the job.  Meeting new people is the best of working in a business such as Home Depot
bad,la parte mas difil del trabajo cuando hay malos entendidos  o herrores la gerencia no acepta explicaciones
bad,"Customer service oriented. A lot of standing, long hours on weekends, majority of rude customers, management is poor, undependable,grouchy,demanding, and mostly lazy. If things go wrong such as inventory, lack of sales, theft, cashiers are the 1st to be blamed for everything."
bad,Every day I would look for lost product. Used many deferent systems to search for that product.
bad,Not a place to get rich off of a job. No weekends off.Unfriendly work staff.
bad,"Only worked at one store but anything retail is pretty much the same. If you are not one of the ""favorites"" you get the bad end of the stick. I was told time and time again that I would be promoted and every time positions became available I was not even considered for an interview. They want you to work like a slave being the only person in your department for the majority of your shift and pay you peanuts. They want you to completely open up your schedule so that they can work you to close at midnight and be back at 5 am. Because they promised me promotion I was able to do what my Department Head could do as far as access to certain things that not all associates could do. I was expected to be my department heads back up and I ended up doing most of the work and not getting paid for all the extras. I have worked retail  before and this is the only company that continues with the lies and pushes you to your limits. Management at this particular store is a joke. while the sales floor is a mad house management team and the selected few associates and department heads are sitting comfortably in the office on the clock having lunch and laughing and talking about non Home Depot things."
bad,Very low pay for lots of work.  Little training and poor guidance.  All in all it was a bad job.
bad,"While working as a customer service representative, my job was to make sure every customer left our store satisfied with their purchase. The best part about working for Home Depot is the customer. I developed great interpersonal skills while working for this company. Co-workers are the next best thing about working for Home Depot. Dealing with management was the hardest part; every manager has an agenda, and it doesn't necessarily fall in line with whats best for the employee he/she supervises."
bad,A typical day would be logging in to the register and waiting for customers to come in. Some customers were nice. i used to be excited to get up and work here until a new manager came in. He basically ruined the atmosphere. The hardest part of this job was trying to harass people to open up a credit card. So annoying. I pretty much dislike retail.
bad,"I worked there all of 3 months, they hired me and put me in a department i knew nothing about and never got the proper training and never got the help when i needed it. Co workers were not around when I needed help and I was not happy in my department. Management did not care about my feelings ."
bad,"high turnonver in employment management dose not communicate automatic scheduling  dose not get the job done"
bad,"Below average, Home depot don't care much for security. and depends on the security agency also."
bad,Interacted with customers instructing them how to fix and install various fixtures and pipes.Maintain and stock the department.
bad,"The management was terrible and unprofessional"
bad,terrible place to work not enjoyable co workers alright magament is terrible not all of them but the ones I deal with
bad,"Working at night doing unloading and stocking. "
bad,"Started out as a lot associate. Took 6 months to become a Garden Associate. I learned a lot but in some cases, I feel it was bittersweet."
bad,"huge to do's "
bad,I will answer upon requests. They would like you to do management work but not get promoted.
bad,The stores are over-worked. Corporate still doesn't understand that the stores need more employees.
bad,"Home Depot changed drastically since changing CEO's. Home Depot brought in an American CEO and the working conditions drastically changed. Forcing people to work holidays, if off sick a day got harassed or threatened with dismissal by managers. Do not value any employees, you can be replaced easily attitude. By time I left everyone was afraid for their job and moral was super low."
bad,On a daily basis you are working on the same thing and thats driving sales. Cusotmer service is poor. 
bad,"The management level will eventually disappoint you, they ask to contribute to many different programs and so call benefits like the stock purchase program and you end up knowing that you are not the true owner of those shares. the 401K is average, they have a good dental."
bad,"They don't go above minimum expectations; shop at Lowe's."
bad,"Poor management. Too ""numbers driven"". Lack of support for sales associates. No sense to the way management is chosen, you can't have someone running a hardware department who knows nothing about, or has little to no experience in hardware for example."
bad,"To box chainy... to many managers, to many regulations. never knew your schedule completely."
bad,I do kitchen design and helped people with the measuring of counter tops and cabinets. Not enough hours to only work there. Also seems as they have hired many full time people and not doing any full time.
bad,"Great co-workers, overtime, easy work, unfair treatment between shifts, under staffed at some points of the year."
bad,"Not enough hours and the hours you get are pretty unstable in terms of you could be called in to work last minute at midnight. For those of us with small children, it is really difficult to find a sitter at those hours. Also, the pay isn't that great."
bad,"Work/life balance is a myth. Scheduling is highly unsatisfactory. High staff turnover. Manager and assistant manager take the glory, play favorites and recognize the same people over and over. Loved working here until the scheduling became unbearable. Co workers were the reason I stayed as long as I did"
bad,They picked favorites! they didn't understand what family was.. If you were sick it didn't matter... Didn't know how to talk to employees..
bad,"After nine yrs of dedicated service at HD. I Got Fired because of a really silly reason. For a company that tries to stress values,they seem to disappear when it is for its associates."
bad,"Home Depot, on first impression, is deceptively a friendly place to work. But it does not take long for a new employee to become painfully aware of the tense atmosphere that permeates Management and trickles down to Sales Associates. Perhaps it is due to the recent changes where stores are no longer under the sole control of a Store Manager. Atlanta Headquarters has taken over in typical conglomerate style. All decisions are deferred and Management at all levels, from lowly Department Supervisors to MODS to the Store Manager live in deathly fear of Atlanta and of being fired, which happens rather frequently at all levels. Management lives according to the unrealistic sales expectations and dictates of Corporate Headquarters. If all this tension was due to high salaries, perhaps it would be merited, but salaries are ridiculously low."
bad,My typical day is extremely busy. The hardest part is multitasking and helping customers at the same time. I enjoy helping customers with their home projects.
bad,"Down stocked aisles. Helped customers. Learned patience like there's no tomorrow. It really depended what store you worked at is what made the difference in the experience good or bad on the workplace. My store had awful management that chose favorites for certain positions all the time even though there were more qualified individuals that had interviewed. I loved my co-workers, that hardest part was leaving them after 5 years and that was tthe most enjoyable part was working with them. Nothing about the job overall was really enjoyable to me."
bad,A typical day at work required me to cover nearly five departments at one time. I learned a lot about corporations and the value of teamwork. Management was available for assistance. The hardest part of the job was having to maintain various departments at one time when the other workers were at lunch.
bad,Assisted customer's on the high end of product resoloution. I learned the environment of business aspects within the corporation that enabled me to aid customers. Management was very much to themselves and not very supportive or even mentoring those on their teams. the struggle was having to learn things on my own that my manager should have been apart of. The most enjoyable part was making good friends that made it easier to work hard.
bad,"In my professional opinion, The Home Depot organization has too many people in positions that do not belong in those positions."
bad,"hard to get full time employ, but they will work you 40 hrs per week, with none of the perks of a 'full time' employee."
bad,This job depending on which store will drain your life. You get paid next to nothing. They want you to do so much for so little. Managers play favorites and act high and mighty. Coworkers have attitudes. Even customers tend to get on your nerves. So not worth it
bad,"A typical work day is about 14 hours. I learned alot of home improvement techiques. My coworkers were are mixture of i know what to do,lazy, and i know everything. The upper managment always told you the bad but never spoke about the good. The hardest part of my job was not being able to go home until 14 to 16 hours of work. Also upper management making you feel like you was not good enough. I enjoyed the things i learned and friends i gained."
bad,"A typical day a The home Depot was hectic and stressful. Dealing with customers were the exciting part of the job. Dealing with management and other co-workers were horrible. I was a very hard worker, had great attendance and helped the company out with meeting deadlines and making money. But unfortunately I wasn't one of the cashiers they showed favoritism towards so it didnt mean anything in their eyes."
bad,"At HD employees are seen as objects - not people. HD does not live up to their stated values. The threat of job loss is every present. Be that as it may, HD is a retail outfit - money is all that is important."
bad,hardest part was having to deal with the management so unorganized not enough coverage.
bad,Poor leadership. Very poor work/life balance. Upper management does not practice what it preaches when it comes to values or culture. Worked my way up the ladder over 6 years and it was a waste if time. Would never work there again.
bad,"If you are looking for part-time hours, or want to become a retail manager this is a good place to work."
bad,store Mangementwas not good i had three different store mangers in the two years i work at home depot...
bad,"The primary management style is an ""It is not what you have done correctly, as much as what you haven't done overall."" So metrics are the mainstay of job performance; when some metrics are high you need to improve all metrics to meet those higher metrics. Which, for part-time, is an almost impossible task to meet."
bad,It’s not the job that’s the problem it’s poor management and associates that have been there for years  that’s are like snakes and do everything in their power to make sure the work life is miserable
bad,"Underpaid overworked and made to feel like your not good enough if the night doesn't go exactly as planned. The Manager (MIM) is two-faced and openly displays favoritism. Supporting company policy only for certain people, and their leadership skills are beyond deplorable. Do not bother asking HR for help because the District Manager has close personal friends in HR so there is no support to the staff who are wrongly treated. Your only chance for advancement is being the manager's favorite. "
bad,To concerned about the safety of employees but let the customers do as they please. Some supervisors dont look out for each others just them selves. Customers get away with what ever they want with no repercussions
bad,It was a good job at first but I have always had a hard time with them when it came to scheduling and security. They don't take employee feedback very seriously.
bad,"It is rotten from management down.  Hard workers stay where they are while management makes sure that lesser qualified move up as to not threaten their advancement or their bonuses.  The best qualified for promotion are the slackers and nosers.  Back stabbing must be a prerequisite for advancement.  Fake environment, fake rotten orange promise.  Everyone is replaceable and management moves up only to do nothing and take credit for hard working employees."
bad,"Most responsibilities fell upon small group of employees; management failed to acknowledge the problem.  Store Manager had close, very  personal relationship with single attractive ASM working for him. Unfortunately, the personal relations shared with him were of greater value than the accuracy, hard work and dedication shown to the customers and the employees work ethics."
bad,"This is a company that has fooled a whole nation. There are no great benefits and definitely do not pay well at "
bad,"Working there for a few years taught me a lot about the tools we rented and different jobs each specific set of tools have. Unfortunately the changing of two sets of management diminished my hard work as an associate, so when the last change was made we “my whole department” excluding the supervisor became a target for what we believed to be petty and childish reasons."
bad,Doent pay enough for feight team work. Over worked and under paid.Benefits are too high. Hard to get promoted. Favoritism for certain workers by the night supervisor over the freight team.
bad,5 core values and they dont follow through.They talk of moving people up but you have to be in their click.They throw all the work on a few people and dont hold accountable people when they dont do their work.
bad,"Management at the El Monte Home Depot is extremely bad. The store manager, honestly could not tell you why she is still employed with any company for that matter. Apply anywhere but there."
bad,"I enjoy enough of the people who work at THD, and I am elated when I see a customer with their dog, also my managers are fair. However, the warehouse can never stay clean for more than 5 minutes so I am grossed out by everything I touch. An unwanted amount of male customers sexually harass me, a female cashier who cannot do much about it. And most of all, I do not have a passion for home improvement projects. Therefore, I want to leave for a place that makes me happier."
bad,"Its a miserable cesspool of dysfunctional people. No one in management cares about us peons. "
bad,"Working here has been horrible. The second i step out of my car and into the parking lot im instantly drained of all motivation i had for the day. The supervisor did little to nothing but expected the most of workers. Theres a severe lack of communication between management and associates to the point where we're unable to answer some of the questions that a customer may ask. They're literally so desperate for cashiers that they'll hire just about anyone but they do very little to keep the people that are actually good at their jobs. its never ""good job"" just ""do better."""
bad,I do not recommend working for Home Depot Exteriors is the Triangle area!  The competition in the home exterior area is fiercely competitive and Home Depot has too many levels between the home owner and the final product.
bad,Terrible place to work. People were constantly quiting and they always had new cashiers every few weeks now I see why. A few head cashiers were extremely rude and pushed casheirs to do jobs that weren't included on the job description when I applied and they also had favorites. I don't recommend it
bad,"Profit oriented and cold blooded "
bad,"Staff are over worked and underpaid, you will not advance in the company if you are not a typical ""Yes man"" and you will constantly have your workload increased with no pay increase."
bad,"This job is the only one I had problems with because the manager in charge at the Story Road Home Depot was kind of a pushy person. Even when injured, they pushed me to do something that i couldn't do, and occassionally smack talk me out to where my emotions would just shut off to the world. I feel like that I am the only one in the freight team that stood up to the manager whom I don't know to this day, possibly still has their job."
bad,"I was working minimum wage for taking in carts, covering cashier breaks and loading lumber, concrete, furniture or whatever else they wanted me to load. No matter how hot or cold or rainy it was, they expected you to be out in the parking lot, pulling in carts or loading customers."
bad,"I was fired because I'm diabetic. Asm cut my 30 min lunch to 10 so I could finish computer training after working there 3 months.  My sugar dropped,  I grabbed a candybar to save my life and was called a thief. I paid the owner double for the candy."
bad,"Must have thick skin because customers will say shocking things to you. Must be able to work for minimum no matter your position or years you work there. If you’re managing the store you will make money and that’s it. The money goes to the store manager and anyone higher up. There is retaliation and humiliation tactics used by management here. Favoritism runs rampant, and so on. Yes, all companies have varying degrees of these things but some more than others and this store particularly is one of the others to a unbearable point since the entire management changed  trust me you don’t want to go here there are better places out there ."
bad,"Can't move up in the company, there's favorites and unfair conditions that they pick who they want in position, some of management is unfair to certain people, not enough hours for part time workers, only 10-15hours a week. Can't survive off what they pay and hotels they give."
bad,"Connecting with the customers a genuine way is now deemed less valuable than skewed metrics."
bad,When you start as Associate you get many hours to do computer training. The Theft rate is harsh. You see it all and can do nothing. It's hard to see the good customer thru all the bad. Management is so aggressive they would cash you out rather than listen to valid time discrepancy. That mean fire you.
bad,"Culture based, activities, free food. Multiple schedule options. Senior leadership could do a better job of listening to their associates.Supervisors are not treated as fairly."
bad,"Does your back hurt? It's about to. There are some really cushy positions at the distribution center. Some employees get to stand in the same spot all day and make good money. Others get to sit on a machine or in an office all day and make good money. Some others get to lift refrigerators, toilets, water heaters, and other heavy products all day. Everything you do is timed, so either you're breaking your back, or you're failing."
bad,There is no advancement for PT employees to FT unless you go supervisor. No matter how hard you work you will always be PT under new HD staffing policy. Management does not listen to concerns. If you complain you are listed as someone who brings down team happiness. I started working here because it was someplace that you wanted to go to work for. Now you might as well go work at walmart the way management treats you. they act understanding but they don't really care. Instead of staffing properly now its mandatory to be able to cover 3 other departments  including specialty sale which takes sales away from people who have quotas. people regularly don't get breaks and go over their 5th hour on lunches. The ac on our site doesn't even work right.
bad,No advancement from within. Bully management style combined with high school clique mentality. Managers only criticized and offered no coaching when you did something wrong. Probably the dumbest and most dishonest management team I have ever seen!!
bad,"In short, good for a first time or short term job. I cannot recommend anyone to stay here for long. The employees are mostly good people, but it's hard to get time off and managers have their heads where the sun doesn't shine when it comes to employee relations. Several of the managers have been known to send employees home crying for absurd reasons, and not b because they were in any kind of actual trouble as far as the store was concerned."
bad,There is little to no training as a new associated. Home Depot pay is disrespectful and treats the employees like with no dignity . I personally had management many time tell employees that if they can’t work to just quit because they can be replaced. I would never recommend Home Depot that to anyone. In my ten years I have see so much management turn over that it’s not worth even shopping there anymore. Home Depot treats and pays their employees like poorly. I know tell all contractors to boycott the Home Depot.
bad,The Home Depot particularly is a very poor place to work. Management is so bad they do not care about the employees. Wages are ridiculously low for what you do even though you have been working with them for years.
bad,"Then work at the home depot. Where no one will care whats happening as long as the customers happy. You can be berated, threatened, and made to cry by a customer but will be told you were the one who messed up. No one shows up? Managers don't care as long as they dont have to help. Then this is the place for you."
bad,"Everyone starts out part-time, unless you know someone. As a pt'r your schedule is where they want you with no reguard to stability or enough hours to eat or pay bills. Management doesn't back you up and turnover is high, always understaffed. Minimal benefits, no medical, no employee discounts."
bad,"I have no words that would give this company an A.  It all sounds good before actually working.  Management sucked and like most places in this new generation, no respect for what's right."
bad,"20 hours per week Really???"
bad,"management has unrealistic expectations for employee performance, and actively works to push out those who have an opinion or strong voice. if you speak out, you will be punished for it unofficially."
bad,"Took alot away from family. Spent long hours in field and then home to do paperwork. Reprimanded for not answering phone when not in a good service area. Had to alert everyone when being in a No service area. Also. Had to respond to every email that I was in the field, so responses would be delayed. But couldn't put an out of office reply on.  Branch manager authorized a job to be done. Sp failed to follow all the rules. I was let go because of it. Manager never reprimand."
bad,This was a sales program that was poorly managed and was falling apart.  I was laid off while I was interviewing at other companies to move on.  I was only happy about the medical benefits.
bad,This is a decent place to work however the management plays favorites. Not all the rules apply to everyone and that’s the worst part of working there.
bad,Pay increases are based on tenure not performance. You get a review every 6 months where you are told you are doing everything right but not promotable just days before being named employee of the month. I was told that one of the biggest factors in determining promotability is credit sales however as the district leader in credit sales I can assure you that is not true
bad,"Like taking orders fro a 25 year old still living at home with Mom and Dad then this is the place for you. Bunch of lazy, mouthy, employees, then you found  heaven. Smoke breaks every 40 mins for 15 to 20 mins each, wow what a deal. But if you dont smoke you have to cover for them. I always see one employee call on the internal phone to other employees ""lets go its time to smoke"". "
bad,The workplace was extremely toxic and combative. the people working there and in management positions are miserable so they do everything possible to make everyone miserable.
bad,"Home Depot- At Home Services was a great place to work, but over the years upper management has destroyed the company by not understanding a professional out side work force or what was required on the installation side of the business and requiring you to work 24/7. What a shame."
bad,"If you are willing to work whenever they make you then go for it. But, they're not family oriented at all and they aren't flexible with your life style."
bad,"Don't bother working at Home Depot. It used to be a great employer, but they cut everything that was good about it in half. Managers only care about employees when the district and regional managers are around. You are treated like dirt."
bad,"Was told I would cover In Home Sales leads for a 3 store area close to my home location. Not enough leads so you are covering areas 90 mins away and many leads are bad. Leads are many times based on an in store person talking to a customer and setting up apt for something we dont do. Store prices on like materials ,counter tops can be much less then in home prices. Over prices products and services.Manager wants you to be available 10 to 12 hours per day on road or in store."
bad,Unproductive and depressing environment to work in. Lack quality management and supervisors unable to give proper instructions. No room for improvemen
bad,I was fired for false accusations and management was aware I had an issue with this person she lied on a statement and.  bragged about my termination.
bad,I prefer not to take part in this survey.. Not sure why this is considered on error. I will just keep typing until 150 characters are met. ect. ect. ect.
bad,"Poor management,  bad pay, wouldn't recommend, hours are horrible no paid time off management favors......................."
bad,"I worked at HD for 11 years, rising up to assistant store manager. They have lost their way. They dont pay more than other retailers, and expect more. They dont pay for experience, they believe technology will enable them to have any person do anything by using their instore apps. They talk about customer service, but all they will have you do is try and keep the place clean."
bad,Been there for five years and so many changes with management and employees doesn’t feel inviting anymore. Pay is okay but trying to move up the ladder is a task if your not in the circle.
bad,They will work as few employees as possible on the floor so its hard to find help. The worst part is they constantly remind you of how much your store is making a week (in the millions) and how you made 30% more than this time last year but how they cant afford raises and are cutting hours.
bad,Low pay. It's not a bad job but all on the clock time has to be accounted for. It's non stop go go go all day. Not complaining but gets tiring when store side associates are playing around and customers ask me for assistance.
bad,"Underpaid considering my experience and capabilities. It is difficult to locate products that people want, from time to time. It is difficult to coordinate the forklift drivers and shutting down aisles when product needs to be downloaded from above. It is a very inefficient operation and frustrating for both the customer and the employee."
bad,Not a place for much growth. Many individuals do bare minimum day to day and not consider overall profits for the company. This affects my job and others.
bad,"No job security, anything you say or do can get you terminated whether its true or not, so therefore you have to be very careful who you are speaking too"
bad,Was a temporary job with no benefits or career. Just got me by until a better job came along. Management and leader ship was not there at all. Glad to be gone
bad,"The Home Depot is a great company and they do a lot for the community. However, working there is a different story. It totally depends on where you are located. The HQs has all of the holidays off. However, The facility at Locust Grove is toxic. Management will not be completely up front with you and they work EVERY Holiday except Christmas so  your work life balance is non existent. They do have good benefits, but as you move up in the company you will see some very unfair behaviors exhibited by the Sr. Leaders. So if you decided to work there, please be careful."
bad,This is a terrible place to work if you care about your well being. The physical strain is not worth it unless you're truly in shape and are a kid from high school.
bad,The Home Depot could be a great place to work if the management was better and really cared about getting you equipped with the right equipment to do your job to the best of your ability. The 8 hour shifts were very hard on your feet back hands arms legs everything hurt when I got home I could barely walk or move. Not really worth the hard work for the little amount of pay very disappointed.
bad,All management are super lazy. Do not want to help. Nor do they care about you or how your day is. Some of them are extremely rude. They are greedy. I don't know how these people sleep at night. It's sad. Short staffed often. Creates a lot of stress.
bad,"A tipical day at work here can either start and 7am, 9 am, 2pm, 10pm or anything in between. "
bad,The company does not advance it's employees. They seek candidates from outside.The staff is almost always stressed as they hire people who always call out.
bad,"THD used to be a great place to work at. The company would pay for certifications but not now-too costly. Before they hired professionals from the field. Today, anyone can work. You take product training courses and you are considered a ""professional botanist"" to get my point across. And when it comes for them to pull the plug on you, no sweat on their part. Also, Rule 1 - Management is always right. 2. IF Management is wrong, read rule #1. That's their attituded. They are a money hungry company. First comes the cash, then the customer and last management. I now understand why Unions blossoms."
bad,"The hiring process should be a little more strict.  Home Depot in Hemet is a horrible place to work especially in the Millworks department.  The so called specialist are shady low ethical employees, management does not care about employees, they care about getting leads.  Leadership is lacking, favoritism is huge.  Would not recommend working at Hemet, Ca Home Depot."
bad,"From a store manager who wouldn't acknowledge your existence even though your name written in large letters on your orange apron, to hours that were inconsistent and diminishing, my years at the Home Depot were to say the least, unfulfilling and hard work unappreciated."
bad,"As with many jobs, they promise a lot up front. Unfortunately, this was the first place that ive worked where it felt like i was seeing it from the outside in the rain. Some of the management team have sharp words for you over simple mistakes mostly due to lack of coverage. The lack of coverage then falls on the other employees who are forced to work harder and faster. All the while management sits back pointing fingers or getting quiet when you come around. If you dont check all the boxes with everyone you work with, you're going to have a rough slide. Lots of backstabbing and set up to make you look lacking of any talent. The ideas are great, organization is mediocre, but that part of management that doesnt deal with customers daily is the problem."
bad,A bunch of grown men acting like children. They are very cliquey and you can often hear thing complaining and talking trash about other people. If you don't like working with trolls then I do not recommend this place.
bad,"its a place for high school kids"
bad,You learn a variety of diffenret things and to learn how to work on your own without relying on anyone else take initiative if you dont know what to do go with instinct
bad,"As a former associate, I felt extremely pushed to the side compared to many other associates. Being a lot attendent, we don’t get recognized for all of our hard work. I was never premoted nor did I receive any notices when they would go in to change my schedule, resulting in my lay off. I was given an attitude that did not make me feel like family or even involved in “The Orange Family”. Wouldn’t recommend this business to anyone."
bad,"Work you until the edge between full time and part time in order not to allow benefits."
bad,"My location was understaffed at the time of employment and so a typical day of work involved juggling the tasks of multiple people including my own. Some of the managers were too friendly, so they thought they were close enough with their employees that it was okay to say things that were extremely unprofessional. In terms of management, it was clear they cared only about the financial bottom line and were completely blind to the needs and comfort of their employees. The majority of the staff was made of part-time employees whose hours were constantly getting cut. As a result, full- time employees were stuck in an endless cycle of playing catch-up on tasks that often did not get accomplished on their days off. There was no real sense of regular accomplishment and the work never felt fulfilling because we were always behind. Because of this, the hardest part of the job was the immense workload, and none of us were getting paid enough for how hard we were working. The only enjoyable thing about the job was the fact that the staff was very diverse. It was nice knowing that, despite everything else, at least my employer hired fairly."
bad,Spent time at two different store with same experiences. Management is very unaccountable for all of their actions. Management only promotes associates they favourute regardless of how incompetent they may be. Requires you to be available all day on both weekend days with only reilgiois exceptions made.
bad,"Dealing with the general public is the most difficult part of the job, some people are very difficult to deal with. You rarely have weekends off, the management is substandard."
bad,The Home Depot has all kinds of public positive ideas that they do not follow. They do not follow their own standards. The HR people are under qualified and have all kinds of personal relationships that they should not. 
bad,locally has poor mgmt. no consistency in rules or advancement. pay is low average for retail sales. very little incentives if any. They talk a good game but there is little to show for it.
bad,Home Depot boasts advancing your career or role within the company yet doesnt honor raise expectations or benefits. Those in the management level are the main benefactors of their advancement and coverage plans.
bad,"Management supports full-timers and ""lifers"", but part-time associates feel expendable. The ""Homer Awards"" require a nomination and, thus, are never handed out fairly. They hire a lot of people who are unqualified and sometimes refuse to let go of them even when they know the fact. I used to like working here, but have since changed my mind drastically. I no longer feel any support from management, I feel like a part-timer is never listened to in town-hall meetings, and I feel that if you work part-time, they just see you as someone to fill an apron. It feels toxic."
bad,it was an alright job you didn't get any real breaks and didn't get very many hours and the other cart attendance weren't the nicest when starting out and also there was hardly ever team work
bad,"the job was very easy, the people i had to work with and the management was terrible very unorganized, things we were suppose to do when first trained changed almost every day."
bad,The location made this store an eye sore to say the least. But with that in mind the management was horrible. Employees both lazy and disrespectful to their coworkers and management.
bad,"The pay is pretty good, but that's basically where the praise worthy things run out. You'll be expected to do tasks meant for multiple people, by yourself with no hope of any help at all, especially when it comes to loading which often times means hand loading thousands of pounds merchandise, commonly for a single customer. You'll be paged to loading calls that can take up to an hour. Many times I've been stuck for hours doing nothing but loading customer vehicles. But you start running into communication issues  as they have no dedicated phone or any type of communication at all for you to actually receive said pages. You just sorta have to hope and pray there will be a phone you can use when you come in for your shift, and if there isn't, you're just expected to know when customers need loading and are sure to hear about it if you don't. And this isnt a new problem, just one that has continued to get worse."
bad,Great employees bad management. Dont appreciate their associates. No real way to advance in the company with so many tenure associates. No employee confidentiality.
bad,"The Front End was a very cliquey/high school environment. Regardless of age, there was a tremendous amount of disrespect and unprofessional-ism on a regular basis. Nothing was done to correct the culture."
bad,Very demanding job when it comes to being on your feet. The adults act like they’re still in high school.  A lot of favoritism that goes on so dont get on anyones bad side
bad,"Being on the lot is exactly how you imagine and have seen when you shop there. Weather plays a huge roll in how your day will go, as well as the cashier associates. "
bad,Management isn’t always the best. There’s a lot of favoritism especially for cashiers if you don’t open enough credit cards or have people do the voc’s you probably won’t be someone’s go to person if you need more hours or not. You want to move up? Yeah become someone’s favorite because other than that you’ll stay where you are. Even if you apply through the internal job thing. There’s no moving up or if you talk to one of the managers they give you a thousand excuses  that you need to fit for a new position but then next day you see someone else already got the part. Alot of fake people to work with. No one really is looking out for you when it’s time to throw you under the bus they will. It’s like you’re in high school all over again. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work for the Home Depot it’s too much stress for the little pay.
bad,It was an stressful job and hardest past working with management and customer. They tell you that you are empower but the only empower you get is no more than $50 dollars or you will get in trouble.
bad,"It's a job. Not challenging, the pay is very low, the benefits are skimpy, and they don't exactly set the bar very high for working there (as demonstrated by the lack of common sense used by coworkers)."
bad,"The job description was for a merchandiser. What it really amounts to is glorified housekeeping with a few projects for new items thrown in for fun. The projects can be intense and very long. Every minute of your day is timed to ensure productivity. They are not concerned with it being correct, just complete."
bad,My time as an employee at this company I did not feel very valued.  Often the work schedule would be changed and I would not be notified and would show up late for work.  Management would allow customers to take full advantage of employees.  The company doesn't even offers discounts to its employees.
bad,"Working at the customer service desk at Home Depot is very difficult. It is poorly managed by someone who is very bossy, rude, and careless about their associates. Management will pretend to care about you because they have to. Hours for part time employees are just not right, how do you expect for someone to provide for their own personal needs and enjoy life when you are shamelessly only scheduling them 12 hours a week. store 0568 is just honestly not that great, associates are overworked and are given impossible high expectations to achieve, when the managers are not willing to do the same work their associates are doing. I know they are aware of what's going on but they turn a blind eye to it because it doesn't affect them."
bad,When you work as the lot person no one cares if you are protected from the heat or the cold or any other adverse conditions. Everything is your fault and everyone expects you to help with their jobs also. There is no employee discount and evidently an employee nor any family can buy sale items unless they are marked down for more than 24 hours which I was not aware of. I lost my job just before the holidays because my mother in law made a purchase for $6.
bad,if you have good morals this is not your job .5085 RDC in lake park GA .undermines every value home depo claims it has . right down to respect for all people .Example . they say if you see some being done wrong . talk with that person in a nice respectful manner . but i have done this and each time they tired saying i was being disrespectful . and without proof they take all accusers at there word . unless you accuse management . then your targeted for dismissal .5085 rdc is a unsafe work place also immoral and personally . Id like to have this RDC relocated out my city  in my 3 years there . the HOLE  RDC platform has received two $1 raises why the 5085 RDC was left out of both Raises . the mini starting pay should of been $16 a hr they refused to give . saying its bc of competitve wages . which is a cop out lie .
bad,"It used to be a great place to work, then they started promoting managers who were only metric driven and did not care about people including the customers. We used to be a family who looked out for one another and helped out each other not stab them in the back to make yourself look better."
bad,"Almost completely unsupervised"
bad,"work in your assign department. Pack down every day. ""See a empty spot. Fill the empty spot. Its hard to pack down product when every co-worker is in their department"
bad,"You don't get paid enough for all the things they have you do, they have you do a lot more then what your suppose to do. for example if your job is to unload trucks, they'll make throw out garbage, sweep the floor, pack out products, and etc..."
bad,The people you will work with will hide from the customer to get paid for doing nothing. The same people will then throw you under the bus when it will benefit then in the the slightest.
bad,"Home Depot as a whole is an excellent employer. Corporate employees care about their employees on the retail level."
bad,"Home depot is a good place to start a career in retail, but it has inconsistent schedules, difficult to promote to various levels of positions such as sales, office work."
bad,"My boss is the worst. The management does not care about me as a person. I am literally struggling with debt I have to pay off and the cost of living in Anchorage is way too high for what I get paid. I tried using the Homer Fund with no support. I started out full-time then they changed me to part time. This has to be one of the five worst jobs I ever had, just because of management."
bad,The motto used to be take care of your associates still take care of the customers and everything else will take care of it so well that’s a load of poo nowadays there is absolutely no teamwork management has no support for their staff everything is let’s make it look good at the time when the walks are supposed to happen and then everything else is run around like chickens with their heads cut off not taking care of a show there and ignoring the customers every once in a while someone will get a good customer review because they’re are Helping a customer that happened to chase them down but usually there’s a reason behind why somebody is helping someone else it is never for the good of the company or the good of the Customer Home Depot as an atmosphere with in the store has gone so far downhill that I won’t even shop there as a customer
bad,Home Depot lights to talk about advancement from within but this is a farce they have consistently hired management from the outside without providing interviews or posting interviews to the Associates.
bad,the managers there just don't follow standard practices and love to micro manage. i feel that the company needs better ways to figure out what's going on with the customers and the employees. going to a 3rd party in which cause they have no clue what's going on in the store but lecture departments in things that are beyond their control.
bad,"Productive and fun workplace with helpful co-workers."
bad,"As some others have posted, with certain home depot jobs, there's no advancement, you're locked into the position you applied for. Some of the managers are terrible, and will sit there and treat you like garbage and do a full 180 once you tell them you're quitting, then go back to the original treatment. They also don't like it when you report things to HR for some reasons, this hasn't entirely been explained to me, but every time someone reports to HR, they're fired within 2 or 3 weeks."
bad,"I've worked at home depot as a cashier for 1 year, company has become less customer friendly and more money hungry requiring cashiers to push credit card applications to every customer and the results effecting their evaluations in a negative way if they achieve zero credit card results.  In the last 6 months there's always basically a skeleton crew working thru out the store, zero help for the front end with no back up cashier help when the lines are long, and the requests are ignored and rebuttal.  Current employees are not getting the help and tools needed to stay and be successful in their roles.  I love interacting with the customers and helping if needed, I do not care for all of the store and corporate drama that has been increasing over the last 6 Months."
bad,"Great benefits, great conworkers, set schedule for full time regular associate, DH and higher not aloud set schedule but work weekends and late to do Ad merchandise sets."
bad,"I dont really want to write a review for this place, but its making me.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to work here, they pay badly.  I work 7 different departments all week, and I get paid for one."
bad,The problem with Home Depot is that  ifmanagment hates you fail to advance. Iknow people who have been there for 15 years and never moved up. The pay has been around $11 since the 90s
bad,"Dangerous work not worth the money.Split days off, HR hires family members or friends."
bad,hours are minimal....morale is very low...pay is terrible...co workers are usually great...the hours and money they expect you to live on is a joke...
bad,"Good place to work but very poor management. Also very flexible with your schedule. Management is horrible, they do not communicate with you at all. They also will play the he said she said game"
bad,Home Depot is not a great place to work at all. Management uses too much favoritism when deciding who works where not based on your experience in a particular area. Hard to get full time work. No employee discounts. Nothing hard about the job itself but the other employees are cut throat.
bad,"First job. Was unhappy with short lunch time, but liked to learn new things about the other departments. Most customers are awesome to assist, but there are quite a few of them that won't be happy no matter what."
bad,Good place to work pays well just not enough workers. Really poor management since they switched and lack of communication and day shift doing work. All in all just a poor environment right now.
bad,"If you are desperate for a job, then Home Depot will be a good fit for you. When I was working there, the management was going downhill, employees didn't want to work and pay/benefits really were disappointing."
bad,"Horrible mamngement, lack of coverage, no back up from managers, lack on floor training, fixed full time hours,closers get stuck with all the dirty work."
bad,"My starting out at Home Depot is different and can vary depending those who like hardware and hard working heavy Labor, my worst experience ever in the first few months that i've worked here are the most atrocious ever! Lumbar is BIG mistake, don't apply here! nothing is worth this job position, look else-where! DH is a joke, and management won't do much to help."
bad,"stock out items on the aisles, scanning items before to send to floors. and learning how to operate reach and pacer truck.  lifting a lot  packages that weigh more than 90 pounds. poor magnament.."
bad,"During my time with the company, I was told a number of times that if I just worked a little harder I would be made full time and they would give me the hours and benefits that came with that. I worked an average of 38.5 hours a week, and was trained to work and could cover for every department in the store. I was still never made full time. "
bad,"HD stresses the importance of their employees and customers. Neither one applies. HD is very clicky. You must fall within the click to go anywhere. Management does not take care of its employees. Again, It's only if you fall within the ""likable"" crew. It's very unfortunate. I really enjoyed working there. But the negative work harder the positive."
bad,They don't really recognize you for the work you do. They don't pay you well and expect so much out of you. The workload can be too much at times. Everyone calls you and expects you to be prompt.
bad,"Promise you plenty of training but they just assign you a bunch of computer training and then throw you to the wolves, good luck! Very unorganized also."
bad,There are clicks. If you dont fit into those they will do everything they can to get you fired or make your work life awful until you quit. Basically it was highschool all over again. The manager of the store has no business leading a company. They also lack in care of the safety for employees. Women were made to walk to the very back of the lot in little to no light at night with no protection.
bad,I been with home depot for 3 years and I make just a little more then the new hires no where to move up unless I drive a hour away plus no one is held accountable for what they do or don't do some people work very hard why others get away with doing nothing
bad,"Minumum wage no staff discounts, no raises! Okay for kids living at home, but not if you need to make a decent wage. too many bosses constantly changing your instructions. Would NOT recommend."
bad,"The Home Depot boasts it's excellence as an employer, but as soon as the training is over you begin to realize that they're just another corporate conglomerate which squeezes what little they can out of their employees' benefits, salary, and opportunities in order to increase quarterly profits. They refuse to show leniency and compassion even towards the most dedicated and valuable employees while expecting an increasing amount of knowledge, skills and work from those on the bottom. Apply at your own peril."
bad,Company has potential to be great. Company should invest on floor 
bad,Sweat shop. The new guys get all the grunt work while the people that been there for awhile cherry pick and the managers just turn a cheek. No a/c and very heavy lifting for little pay.
bad,"I was in Grad School while employed. Their was a manager called ""Tree"" that did not like my ambition. He terminated me. However, later the company contacted me regarding an outside sales position."
bad,"A typical day at Home Depot starts with overwhelming task and not enough people to accomplish it. Management view "
bad,"2018 across the board pay cuts for reps and managers. Many of the top managers in the company left because pay would be cut over 50% in some cases. THAT IS GREED. Rep pay went from 100% to 50% up  front and balance at completion of install, which is sometimes 3 months....no car allowance for reps. Countless hours spent in the stores helping store customers and trying to find a lead. it is basically free hours for the store, and you get zip for it. "
bad,"The safety program is overly stupid,the department supervisors are control freaks,communication between employees not great and the only friendly staff is on day shift,minimum wage work,if you go there keep looking for other work!!!!"
bad,"Horrible, bullying, ignorant management. Almost no practical training. Getting you medical as promised is like pulling teeth. If you don't care about constantly being bullied and having constant lies spewed to you and only have compensation expectation of under $60,000, then this company might be for you. One more thing, be ready to make sales and have the the installers botch the installation or make the customer wait many months for the installation with no contact from the company. If any of this creates a situation where by no fault of your own the customer rightfully cancels, you will loose all your commotion. This happened to me constantly. A lot of work for nothing."
bad,"Starts with a meeting then we are broking down into projects or general service. Management on the MET side has little power to bring about change. They pay is low which shows in the employees they tend to hire and the high turn over rate. The job isn't hard the pay isn't good, I enjoyed working with my team. I got along with most of the store employees."
bad,under-paid and under appreciated. I believe that all associates do way to much for what we had to do and problems we dealt with. Poor management was the main cause.
bad,Management only looks at you as a number and never backs their employees. The breaks are pretty good. They training is good. Not many opportunities to move up in the chain of command. Not enough store associates.
bad,Once you set your availability you cannot change it so make sure you do not change anything. Home Depot is not willing to bend to make new accommodations in your availability.
bad,Management its ran very poorly at Home Depot and not enough pay for as much work as they want you to do. you have to be a full time employee in order to receive benefits
bad,"The Home Depot is a values based company, they say.  Their values of Building Relationships, Do The Right Thing, etc. are all over the walls.  Unfortunately, these are just art.  The company does not live by its values in the way it treats its employees."
bad,"Managers are trigger happy, they will write you up for simple mistakes..won't listen to employees explanations, Management by fear."
bad,"As a supervisor in any department, we didn't have enough employees to get the job done on a Dailey basis. Many supervisors were complaining about the shortage of employees in their department to management. I was a supervisor in 4 departments , Kitchen & Bath , Plumbing, Electrical and Paint."
bad,Home Depot is a mediocre place to work. They don't pay you enough for the amount of work you do. I wouldn't recommend workout in a department outside of cashiering. Management usually don't care about issues around the store. Not a solid place to work.
bad,"Paid very well for the role. However, favorites were constantly played, extreme micromanagement and very fake people at the company. "
bad,"had no guidance from assigned leader, was not included in important and relevant information regarding projects and when I brought this to attention of leader and management was ignored. It was impossible to produce quality work without having relevant project parameters and info. My lesson, do NOT speak up, instead look for another job."
bad,"Worst software development department I've ever worked in.  The management treated highly skilled developers like they were retail store workers that needed to be watched constantly.  Their ""AGILE"" was the worst rendition of AGILE I've ever seen.  User stories had terrible acceptance criteria and obtaining clarity on the matter was like staring into a black hole : devoid of any direction, shape, or hope."
bad,"Typical day: Over stressful due to hostile work environment and non-stop duties and workload. Constant learning on how to handle difficult people and situations.  Management is good for guidance but nothing else.  Workplace culture fun and humorous co-workers, but micro management with unrealistic expectations plus management only delegates.  The hardest part of the job is balancing duties to assisting customers, there is not a middle ground.  The most enjoyable part of the job is co-workers and punching out to go home."
bad,"Poorly-managed work place with no cohesive management. Sales staff expected to know all aspects of store operations by osmosis. Even though I was in appliance sales, I was expected to fully comprehend plumbing, flooring and kitchen fixtures and design."
bad,I was there for five years and went through 3 different store managers not to mention several assistant managers.  But with all of them it was the same thing.  They were only interested in the employees who would benefit them personally or who were in a specific cultural background.  I did not fit in either one.
bad,Management was terrible the definitely had favorites. if you weren't a favorite they would ostracize you and make you do petty work that no one else wanted to do.
bad,"A typical day there was usually slow or fast, there wasn't anything in between, different departments would pull other people from their departments, stopping the work flow and if the manager was on the floor, he'd pull workers from what they were doing, meaning if they were already with a customer he'd tell them to stop and help with another. Personally, i don't agree with such action but i was in no place to say anything"
bad,"worked at my store for 8 years. Figured Out pretty quick that employees being number one was BS. The only reason I stayed so long, I made more money than most associates.Shareholders are definitely number one. Employees are at the bottom of the list. All you people claiming that this is a great job and then state that the cons are low wages and low hours need to think about what you just said. Customers are ALWAYS right. No matter how rude or vulgar they are.   "
bad,"I was the first female in my job at that store, was older than more than half the crew, was asked to train new crew members, completed more than 70 laps around the store each day in the performance of my duties, helped other departments when all orders were filled, maintained a very clean and organized work space, and yet was told that I was not doing enough and was passed over for full time schedule in favor of a male co-worked that I trained.  My regular schedule was only at most 6 hours per day, no more than 26 hours per week.  My titled position required that I gather together all products ordered for delivery which included various sizes of lumber, 60 to 80 pound bags of concrete, kitchen cabinets, etc... and put them on pallets or strap them in preparation for loading on to a flatbed semi truck or into a box truck for delivery to the location of the customer's choosing."
bad,"No leadership at all very unorganized department no one seem to know what anyone was doing  , It seemed like everyone had a hiding place and you were the only one who didn't know about it , leaving you with everything to do . Where was the management? probably in the secret hiding place."
bad,"The family attitude at this company is skin deep. Performance is not based on metrics, it is based on favors and complaints. If you make the mistake of gaining a reputation as someone who works hard and out-performs your peers you will be rewarded with their work, or your bosses."
bad,"Working for customer service and returns has helped me with my skills as far as answering phone call, doing special orders, handling money, having the ability to communicate with my coworkers as a team, but most giving our customer the best customer service we can give them. i enjoy working at home depot because a person get to know a little of every department; however, as far as management there is a lot of favoritism, expect more than can be done, training is horrible (either sink or swim). also coverage in the afteroon/evening is horrible not only does one have to stress about orders, so far but finding someone to cover breaks and lunches. i thing that can be enjoyable is meeting and interacting with customers to help there needs!"
bad,Would like a more set schedule and better money for the qualifications I have.  Need to have more family/work balance.  Need more consistent hours.  No set schedules.
bad,"It takes years to get full time, the pay isn't anywhere near where it should be for the amount of knowledge you need to help most customers. Fellow employees were friendly and knowledgeable, they also taught me a lot."
bad,Low ratings due to EMPLOYEES that I work with. 3 have bad attitudes and are rude. the other 3 I get along with I do not work with as frequently as i would like. First chance I get I'm bolting.
bad,"Don't work here unless you're fresh out of high school and you're looking for a job to make ends meet for a few months. Any more than that, and you'll lose your mind. Very few options for advancement, very lackluster pay, and the work itself is dull."
bad,"A typical day at work involves me being one of three drivers from open (6a.m.) to close (9p.m.) in one of the hardest, busiest, and most labored departments in the store. So, in addition to maintaining the cleanliness of the department, I also had to pull orders, sometimes for hours at a time, re-stock the inventory from the overhead, and customer service. "
bad,"The work environment is very fast paced with a nonstop flow of customers. There is room to move to a variety of departments if one chooses to expand ones knowledge base. "
bad,Not a company that rewards efforts cronies get better positions and opportunities. Some are asked to do best for the customer yet the bottom line is more important to management it's all lip service
bad,"What started as a ideal position working with customers at their home, turned into a struggle after the unexpected death of my manager.   In short, communication with the Regional office in another state was cut off."
bad,The job is easy to learn. The employees are friendly and helpful. Management treats this workplace as a social club. Promotions and desirable job duties are given out to those who kiss up to management. Good workers are worked extensively with no perks.
bad,"Never enough employees scheduled to handle the customers and stocking. Constant issue. Pay is pathetic, given what they expect from you. Their scheduling is based mostly on keeping people from finding a second job, or to keep their more talented people tired so they won't look for a new position. Sad because it could be a great place to work, if they would really invest in their people."
bad,Not a place i can say i would ever want to work in again. Working for the customer service is the worst place in the store.Very fast alot of rude people and the people who work at the store are rude to the customers as well.
bad,"There was very poor management,weird hours, rude customers that think they are above everyone else. I will say that as a cashier, my coworkers were friendly and kind, they always have each others backs, but its the management that ruined my opinion of home depot. Most but not all the managers were controlling and on a power high, they also liked to belittle the people they were over. Most of the people I worked with wanted to find other jobs but were there as a last resort."
bad,several safety violations ignored or dismissed when management is notified. harassment is out of control and managers get moved store to store once reported that is how it is handled or reporter is targeted and fired. less qualified males promoted before highly qualified females. New hires sub par and abusive to other employees but again only spoken to no disciplinary action taken to create a safe and respectful work environment
bad,Home depot is an okay place to work. Moving up with the company takes a long time. A typical day at work includes dealing with customers some good and some rude.
bad,"I am seeking other employment because I need a full time job with medical benefits. I decided not to stay within the company because they are low staffed, high turnover, and overworked. I did not get along with my team members."
bad,When I was there they were going to flex hour employees and full time people where getting placed on flex hours cutting their hours and pay checks. This an the facts that they were cutting out long time staff members
bad,"good after school PT job for high schoolers...not much else. Retail isn't for all, maybe good for retirees and students. Low pay and long hours do not a career make."
bad,"The overall team of people you meet at the home Depot are awesome to work with. Unfortunely some of the Management team doesn't live up to the motto of ""Home Depot standards of taking care of Our Customer's taking of Ourselves and taking Care of each Other"".  Some of the management team doesn't look out for their employees as much as they would like for people to believe."
bad,Working for a multi billion dollar corporation is sure to suck the soul from you. Don't do it. But they did teach me how to drive a forklift. I hate it
bad,"Opportunity for advancement is very political. Education, exceptional job performance, and experience  (for me), has continuously been overlooked. Management fail to coach and develop those that perform with excellence, and commitment.  Upper management is very deceptive about career advancement. Pay is horrible for the work which is required and the accountability that come with it. Home Depot do have great benefits. My day is spent qualifying customers with their appliance needs, meeting sales quota, resolving delivery/warranty issues, providing non-stop exceptional customer service, dealing with rude disrespectful customers. I'm constantly learning something new, no two days are the same. The hardest part of my job are the physical demands, and being on your feet for 8 hours a day;  not doing what you really want to be doing, knowing you're capable and qualified for increased responsibilities/a role more commensurate with your education and experience."
bad,"They cannot make a set schedule to save their souls.  They expect you to work 8 hours one day, then come back again in 8 hours for a mandatory meeting, and then come to work in about 6 hours."
bad,Where to start..Not a place to work for the faint of heart. Wouldn't recommend to work there if you aren't physically fit or can't sell bread to a baker (because that's what management expects of you). Definitely a stressful job that can take years off your life. Some people can do it and actually enjoy it (which is fine) but they're typically those with a type-a personality. Management is stockpiled with type-a personalities whose expectations far exceed an associate's capabilities or pay grade.
bad,"Poorly managed"
bad,Poor management allows s*xual harassment to run rampant and being a professional butt kisser is the only way to make it anywhere. Good place being run by bad people.
bad,Company culture now defacto  encourages most employees to find work elsewhere because of poor overall working conditions and low wages even though they continue to pretend they don't.
bad,"The culture at Home Depot changed in the years I worked there.  It went from the great, care about your employees, pay for what they know, to hire any minimum wage person off of the street."
bad,I loved my coworkers but did not care for management. No one is fairly paid for the amount of work expected. The company does not care about employees.
bad,"The Paterson, NJ Home Depot is terrible. I cannot speech on other locations for the Home Depot, but I'd assume they are similar or worse, since they are allegedly the HD with the highest revenue in Passaic county."
bad,Only good if you are trying to work as a part-time; Definitely don't recommend this place as a career since it is so demanding in a bad way. Not the best free stress environment and terrible customers.
bad,"Working at home depot was unsettling and the managers did not care unless you were a supervisor. Multiple complaints went in about one individual and nothing was ever done because they ""did not see it."" There are multiple cameras everywhere in the store."
bad,"They hire a lot of part time here but, don't have a lot of hours to realistically expect to keep good people. If management has a problem with you, you're a target. Hours decrease, write ups begin and you're pushed to quit. Just unfair place to work.The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service."
bad,"A typical day at work can be good one minute and not so good the next...  its like expect the unexpected ..... "
bad,"Favoritism is very noticeable in the company, and if you are a responsible worker you will be stuck with majority of work duties. Company should make all associates carry their own weight rather than making decisions based on personal opinion of workers."
bad,Being a woman in a mans world is tough enough. But the harassment I faced on a daily was enough for me to quit. Great benefits but the male associates need a course on respect of women
bad,This job sucked. Management was filled with idiots. Job didn't pay enough. The best part of the job was being able to meet new people every week. Coworkers were much better than the managers.
bad,"Management has gone way down and you know you really aren't valued as an employee for this company. They do not promote well from within and they don't give enough appreciation for hard work, care more about metrics and numbers than their employees."
bad,"This company only cares about profit. They claim to be ""Home Depot Family"" but all that was experienced was a hostile work environment. During my stint at home depot I saw employees who put minimum effort into daily activities advance, and hard working employees get thrown under the bus along with criticism on job performance."
bad,"referring to store 1915 in Quincy IL."
bad,"Home depot is not a bad place to work there are just a few issues that tend to bother those that currently work for this company, sick days are very limited and doctors notes are no excuse."
bad,"Great People at the Local level, but it's obvious Corporate is clueless. "
bad,"This company is very petty, they will write you up for the smallest thing. The pay is horrible, they will make you do back breaking hard labor of minimum wage"
bad,Working at the Home Depot warehouse is stressful and tiring. Good workers aren't appreciated there just made to work harder than the lazy ones that aren't doing anything all day. They drain out the good workers while the bad ones go home without breaking a sweat. I don't feel like progress is worth it as the supervisors are basically worked as slaves for the company. There's no discounts or benefits worth working for the company.
bad,"Experienced cashier in all areas. can do lumber and gard n areas, as well.Not enough knowledge associates in floor departments.. Have astrong belief in customer service."
bad,While I was working for Home Depot my job was to gather the carts and put them in the right places where they belonged. I also had to help customers load up their car and unload their car if they needed any assistance.
bad,i would never work for this company again. They under paid and only gave 40 cent raises and I was told that was a good raise by their standards.!!!!!!!!
bad,"I have been shunned out of my yearly raise, the management treats associates like children. It's a great place to work if you are on the first shift though."
bad,"Home Depot slowly starts to suck the life out of everyone, except upper management. If you get hired, ensure you do not believe something good will happen!"
bad,Help customer with there needs and direct them to the proper area of  the store for assistance for there projects. Knowing them as a friend as they came into the store and able finding out what project they are working on and what product would be best for there needs. The other thing is not being able to be moved to learn something else I really love to learn about other things in the store not being a cashier all of the years that I was there.
bad,"Company is ok but management seems to allow customers treat associates like grabage, had a incident when a customer used racial comments against a cashier."
bad,"As an order puller my typical day would be of gathering up merchandise for customer orders within a specified time frame. Limited amount of help required me to work even harder just to fulfill orders. A lot of the time I would need an additional hand for assistance when operating a forklift or lifting merchandise over 100 pounds or more manually. Due to employees helping other customers this task of finding an additional person can at times become difficult and time consuming. With all of the duties one was responsible for with manual labor, my feelings are that I was being under paid."
bad,As a customer care associate in the home depot I am responsible for taking inbound calls and providing the necessary assistance to ensure customer satisfaction.
bad,Not a very pleasurable experience at the home depot as a cashier! however I've heard other positions are much better! They want you to do the most work in the store a you get paid less and overworked!! And Cashiers are not second base security that is what LP is for!
bad,The MET TEAM has a great schedule for single parents and the mangers are very flexible and put family first. The job consist of a lot and the commutation between the store employees and the MET is not very good but the hours are good and pay is decent.
bad,You work hard for little pay and not enough recognition. I feel the higher your position was the less you care for the actual team. I saw alot of favoritism and no real support. Management only came out when corporate would come walk us. It's was an overwhelming and discouraging place to work at.
bad,"A typical day consisted of mixing paint and helping customer choose colors that would look nice or coordinated with the decor in there homes and businesses. Also, aiding customers in locating products and tools they needed to complete projects for their home or businesses, measured and cut a variety of different materials. Greeting customer, restocked merchandise , loading and unloading pallets of merchandise ,organized shelves/general house keeping, and promoted credit or promotional services / recommended home repair pros to aide customers to complete home improvement projects. I learned more from the customers then management team, about what tools work best for repairs and which products were best as well. The hardest part of this job was politely dealing with a supervisor who was constantly trying to get me in trouble and treat me unfairly by writing me up for everything she could in order to make me lose my job.If the Jersey city 180 12th st Home depot had better supervisors and management this would be a great job.The most enjoyable part was helping customer design there homes and learning about ways to complete projects from the pro customers."
bad,"It is hard to manage life and work.  If you are willing to work all the time, this is the place to find employment. It was not run very well, they needed more management."
bad,I did over night packing out and also sales associate.. I helped people all over the store with anything they want. Over night is ok you still work. I want a better job
bad,"Good luck trying to stay out of the trouble that goes on here. The harder you try to stay away from it, the more your name gets brought up. The work is very tough and the pay is minimal. The benefits were okay but the second that you get hurt or need some time off, prepare to find another job."
bad,"Poor management at this specific store. Promises were made for advancing in the company, and they were not an option for the position that I was given (not applied for)."
bad,While i worked there i went through 3 different mangers that had to be let go due to constant drug abuse. Scheduling was automated leading to disagreements with employees and managers.
bad,"Limited part time opportunity, limited advancement, limited hourly wage for job expectations, management turnover and poorly scheduled work hours.  This seemed to be a part time opportunity for  students and retirees."
bad,"At the beginning i had no problem with working at home depot because i worked at one before but it was in the suburbs. As the months went on i started realizing how horrible the management was.  They dont care about another problems that you have, even if you still coming to work on time and put 200% into your work. The management team is two faced. Grown people talking about you when your not there, just dumb petty stuff that goes on."
bad,"L'administration n'a malheureusement pas de respect pour les employés.  Même les consignes les plus basic pour un service à la clientèle exemplaire n'est pas tenu par l'administration.  Par contre, les associés ont un grand souçi pour les clients.  Une grande chance qu'ils ont de bons employés pour répondre aux clients parce qu'il ne serait plus là."
bad,"leads suck, training is worse, expectation as a 100% commissioned sales rep is that you spend a large part of the day working at a  table at the store trying  to generate your own leads."
bad,"Management was not up to par, a lot of rumors, employees talked about other employees, managers did not follow proper  steps/ procedures. Always on foot, barely time for breaks."
bad,THD is known for mediocre hours and worse pay.  I was lucky enough to use them as a stepping stone to a much better company. It's retail with long hours and unrealistic expectation if you would like to move up.
bad,"don't waste your time working at The home depot, management will yell at you, difficult to get more than 4  hours/week, co-workers were nice but nearly everyone I worked with hated their job.  They have the highest turnover rate I've ever seen."
bad,"Not a place to start a career. Total dead end job, really looking forward to find a career and not a job. Schooling is really the only way. This is more for a college student wanting extra money or a teen fresh out of high school."
bad,"not a bad place to work.but their is no future.worked in almost every dept in store.home depot used to hire experienced people but not anymore,you are just a body and they dont care about your skillset"
bad,management in the store does not take anything that is a work hazard serious. there is always saftey issues that they would not fix.
bad,"My jobs, (there were many) at Home Depot were very easy and I enjoyed them. However, the management literally chased people who would not play political games out the door."
bad,"Typical retail operation with poor  management constantly under the gun by corporate for results.  Nice coworkers.  Hours can be anything from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM 7 days a week.  Little chance for significant increase in pay even for excellent results.  Good place for students or semi retired people looking for part time work.  Full time positions are employer of last resort.   Two entry type positions: Associate and Specialist.  Associate has no revenue target, Specialists do.  Specialists will be fired for not making quota.   No commission on sales performance only twice a year success sharing awarded store wide with no difference between good employees and those who could care less.     An interesting example:  Assistant Store Manager requested half day off for daughter's High School Graduation.  It was turned down.  Company policy prevented her from switching schedule with other managers of the same level when they offered to do so.  If you need a job fine but keep looking for better."
bad,Always struggling to find people who will actually work and the people who actually do show up to work get criticized or in  trouble. Don't appreciate hard working employees.
bad,"We are one team not one person. It is a great, friendly and enjoyable environment to work in. The management is excellent."
bad,A typical day consisted of working any department a manager requested and then being scolded for not working only your department. Working on task alone meant for multiple team members.
bad,"I worked at Home Depot for 11 or more years. At the time after Katrina it was important for me to help New Orleans rebuilt. I enjoyed it at first; the pay was not great but the benefits were better. Pay increases were very small and somewhat frequent, but that changed several years latter to where they were less and not so frequent or hardly at all."
bad,"Continually expected to work 10 to 12 hours per day, they claim they don't but they schedule you for mandatory meetings that extend your day."
bad,"Couldn't stand the place but i needed a job during school. Managers werent the best. High turn over rate! Super stressfull "
bad,I have worked here ten years and it has only gotten worse as the environment is not one of positivity but of negativity.  Associates are asked to do way more than possible and then asked why customers are upset?  It seems as if quality associates are few and far between because most associates don't know much and their shelf life is a couple of months so experience is severely lacking.  If you are knowledgeable you are taken advantage of by fixing what others mess up but nothing gets done to stop the mistake from happening again which is mind numbing.  The pay raises are laughable as you can hit all your numbers and do it all but your getting what everyone else gets which is not much.  Pay is horrifically bad and most associates are way under the poverty line while working here.  There are no cost of living wages so pay does not match what's going on in society but nothing is ever addressed.
bad,There are both good and bad things about working here. The majority of the people working there are alright but there are also many employees who are not. Management is horrible you name it they are probably doing it..
bad,Prepare for a physical job with all of the negatives of working in a warehouse and all the negatives of a retail job. The only decent thing about this job was they worked with my school schedule fairly well.
bad,"I constantly worked two departments by myself, when I did get assistance they complained that it was too much for two people. Management and corporation did not accept doctors note to excuse absences, I ended up losing this job because of my chronic migraines."
bad,"I worked with a lot of great people during my time there, however the management was not very good.  Micro-management was definitely their thing...but I guess that is par for the course in the retail industry.  Started as a part-time sales associate and stayed above average on my sales metrics, then my hours were cut and I was only there for 10 hours a week.  Naturally my sales slumped far below average.  The Store Manager offered me a full-time position which I accepted...the deficit I was in as far as my metrics were concerned only got bigger.  They got to the point where I could not keep up no matter how hard I tried.  Ultimately I was fired for this.  Could be worse,  I still could work there."
bad,"Being lot associate is a joke for the pay they give you, better off working at tims or mcdonalds, at least they're somewhat nice and decent management."
bad,"The Home Depot needs to pay more attention to the way in which store managers relate to their  associates , as a supervisor the tools needed to execute my job was not provided but yet one is required to perform above and expectations ."
bad,"During the orientation process they tell you we are a big family. And that is true if you get accepted in their ""click"". The pays scale is way different for every employee. Some get hired in making more than people with 2 years of experience have. Never have enough people working. One person could be expected to cover 4 different departments. This place has great potential. Maybe the other home depots aren't like this."
bad,"Home depot is a workplace where you want to work short term, there is no long term goals there. favouritism is rampant in the company."
bad,"I worked for a year at home depot, during which time I was treated very unfairly and looked down upon by the management staff. I had numerous issues staying hydrated, especially during the summer months, and would often times be yelled at for coming inside the building to gain access to water supplies. Work is hard and you are not compensated nearly enough for the back breaking labor you accrue during an average work day. I would recommend staying away from this place should you care about your overall health and well being both physically and mentally."
bad,They didn't have a lot of hours to offer. The employees were great and friendly. The labor wasn't worth the pay but the customers were always polite and generous to us.
bad,"home depot was a decent place to work, i didn't mind the hours because they always stayed the same. they got a new system to unload the trucks that really cause more work for everyone else and things not hectic. i didn't mind working at home depot though"
bad,"In the beginning I really enjoyed my job as Cashier.  Then they put me in Returns; I enjoyed that also. The problem was the Supervisors. If you punched in 1 minute late, you were called in on the carpet.  While there I injured my back.  I had back surgery and came back to work.  One of the worst supervisors put me out in Garden to work the register.  This is after surgery.  Later in the evening when it was my time to leave, he made me sweep the entire garden department, empty trash and so forth.  I told my boss I could not come back to work under that kind of stress and I was just going to have to quit.  They told me I could never work there again because I did not give a notice.  I told her if I worked long enough to give notice I would probably have to have another back surgery. I believe the supervisor that forced me to sweep and empty trash was fired."
bad,"No room for advancement within the company unless you relocate or kiss some major butt at the store you work at. The employees you work with are enjoyable and friendly for the most part. Things have went down hill since starting wages have changed for new hires. Current employees that have been there at least a year some more did not get a pay raise when starting wages went up for new hires. so basically if you were making $10 p/h after working there for 2 years, new hires come in making $10p/h . Therefore, your work performance raises meant nothing! They need to treat their FAITHFUL employees better and they will have less of a turn over"
bad,"I liked working in the Vault, it made for interesting days."
bad,"A typical day at work is going to punch in grab my apron and go he register and check out customer or contractor, all the while walking to the front of the store being stop by customer who need assistant either in finding a item or having specific question about project they are working on. I have not been train on all department in the store but the customer think because you wear the orange apron you are suppose to have a idea of what going on with all Home Depot Product.Most people have a smart which you can download the app and help customer locate a item but if we are short staff which we are most of the time because of management we get bombard with angry customer.Im standing on my feet trying to make customer happy by helpng to do what i can and maybe know and try to learn about other thing i dont know. Check out customer with no barcode on the item or item not even in system or we have to either hold them there until we find a specialist or a manager in that dept.to get a price all while my line is getting longer with anger customer and contractor who on their jobs and wanted to stop by our store to complete and we cost them time and money and because of that we may have to give them a discount to come back again. I feel like i work for a circus because anything seem crazy and the manager are running around like chicken with their heads cut off because they have to correct so many problem as well as try and keep a work staff in place because of poor organization from the top down."
bad,"The pay is not competitive.  When I started my plan was to be an ideal employee and hopefully move up within the company.  My immediate co-workers were nice and fairly good workers.  The low level management above us was awful.  They were scattered and as unprofessional as can possibly be.  There is essentially no way to be recognized for hard work when you are working under layers of incompetence.  Luckily I figured this out quickly and landed a job elsewhere.  Hardest part of my job was seeing my pay stubs.  I was hardly making money considering the cost of gas and food.  Although we all got along at work morale was low.  I'm happy to be out of there and have steered a few folks away from applying.  "
bad,"NOT a flexible job at all. Made me chose between jobs while dealing with constant Harassment by supervisor and management (Which they denied to my face) "
bad,Mostly seasonal positions. They told me I could be hired on part time after 3 months. After 3 months they let me go but said i didnt do anything wrong. they just needed labor for the summer and didnt care about me. managment and customers are rude.
bad,"Liked the owners/small business-liked the high volume (fast-"
bad,"Not a bad place to be, very political place to work. To move up the ladder you have to fit a specific mold. Worked with every one just fine, some better than others. Best part of the job was the customers and having them always coming back to work with me."
bad,"The company seemed great, in all my research. My continueing research (within the company) STILL seems worthwhile & optimistic, yet my experience in this store has made me miserable. NO opportunities for advancement unless you join  the bigoted, juvenile social aspects of the supervising staff. Most all employees do not smile."
bad,"I was employed here to catch up the tool rental department on an extensive list of back repairs that the previous technician didn't have the ability to complete. As soon as I caught up the department, I was laid off. Good riddance, Home Depot doesn't care about its employees, just profits."
bad,The job it self was great. The company does work with loop wholes when a worker is out on medical leave. I was not the only 1 who lost their job while out with health issues. I would have loved to stay there.
bad,"The culture is very ""Good ole Boy"" system.  They don't welcome new ideas.  The company has stopped expanding or building new stores so there are no more advancement opportunities anymore.  They don't have any structured schedule for assistant managers so you have no other life outside of work.  For example the divorce rates are very high and you won't be able to parent your children.  Very selfish store managers and district teams that only care about themselves.  The replenishment system is light years behind any other big box retailer, taking weeks to get self's resupplied.  The in-home services they offer are a joke, they contract out the worst possible providers (ie. they are to cheap to pay anyone good) who cause nothing but trouble for customer service complaints that have to be resolved by using store markdown money (ie. coming out of your bonus).  They pay very well.  So if you don't care about doing the right thing for the customer and can handle micro managers who can't make up their minds then Home Depot is for you."
bad,unless you are a sheep.  they don't want you.  they don't want people that think.  corporate doesn't care about staff.  just how they can separate customers from there money.
bad,A tipical day at work at Home Depot is defined as a multitasking enviroment with shortness of staff and demanding Managers who lack respect for the employee.
bad,Starting pay is low...even with experience. The insurance is very expense compared to the salaries received. Favortism is a very big problem at this company in a whole.
bad,"I worked in a very fast,stressful environment on a daily basis where many people were not pulling their own weight and management always depended on me to not only complete my job but to do other peoples jobs as well because they didn't have enough qualified associates. The hardest part of the job was being able to get things done in time. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers. Management was more concerned about the sales than they were about their associates which made it a negative place to work."
bad,"There is no typical day in this position. Tasks are completed as needed and I may be directed to complete tasks from other departments. A day may begin with needing to quickly and safely unload delivery trucks with a forklift or similar equipment. I may then be tasked with filling shelves with product and making sure the sales floor is well stocked and aesthetically pleasing to customers. At certain times during the day I may be assigned to a particular piece of equipment such as a board saw, drill, paint mixer as needed to assist customers with requests for customized products. Toward the end of my shift I would be required to check inventory, ensure the aisles for which I was responsible were clean and well stocked, and report needs for resupply to management."
bad,"I worked there for a few months and did not like it. Love  shopping at the store, but as for working there, did not. The managers and supervisors only paid attention to you if you were one of their favorites. So if you are one to kiss up to the bosses by all means, but if you are not then find yourself working two days and barely any hours. Had to go to the distract HR to get pay raise that was promised when hired to different position."
bad,"My work day consists of ISAL, OO, TBOS, End Cap changes, Planograms, associate involvement, goals, customer service, clearance end caps, ordering, pack downs, reviews of associates, assigning jobs daily, training, no home locations, store systems, shrink binder plus a lot more"
bad,"Typical Day: Deal with good and bad people in the form of customers and associates."
bad,"Unfortunately being a large box store Home Depot does not care about there employees, at least not part timers. You have to be apart of the management before anything before they try and help with anything. They will tell you that they are number one to there employees in realty you are just a number to fill a hole. Pay was a joke, insurance was too expansive, and receiving any satisfaction from management was like pulling teeth. "
bad,"I've worked with this company for three years part-time and recently full-time. One consistent feature to this company: morale is extremely low on an sales associates level. You will be expected to perform tasks (i.e:cleaning a department by yourself, restocking heavy inventory alone, multitasking in various departments that are not your own) while aiding customers under serious time constraints. But you're not allowed overtime to complete tasks in your department, and you will be expected to meet daily metrics (i.e: leads, credit cards, sales plan). The work will be mentally taxing and physically draining. All in all: good luck if you work here. Perform miracles on minimum wage."
bad,"The hiring process must be very lax, as THD goes through so many workers a quarter. THD hires people who do not want to do work, they simply want to show up and get a check. There is far too much work put into maintaining the store for even one person from each department to slack. Unfortunately its usually only one person from each department doing their job. The burden of maintaining a department and helping customers lie on an individual with a work ethic. This experience will ruin you if you are a hard worker. Your hard work never pays off. Managers say they will move you and train you and help you move up, but it takes 2 years and when you do move up you do not get a raise. It would have been easy to get by like the bulk of the workers but I take too much pride in my work for that attitude. No matter how much I had done in a days shift I was always expected and asked more. I was pushed daily to an exhausting and infuriating point.  As my coworkers left the building with stark white unscathed shoes, I was covered in dirt and mulch and sweat."
bad,"Not For Me, co-workers were enjoyable however, schedule flexibility is one thing but outside life was nearly impossible to structure around work schedule"
bad,"I hated this job, I was stuck outside for over two years and was never offered to come work inside, i was often by myself to get all the carts and help customers with loads, rude customers with no respect, i also after two years of marginal raises was making less than new hires when i left"
bad,"if you are looking to have a life, promote based on performance, have a weekend off every now and then, a stress free environment, not get yelled at by customers, then don't look here."
bad,"I've never been asked to do so much for so little before. Working in the kitchen of a restaurant is very fast paced, and while you may be good at the job, you will hate it because of the low pay. Meanwhile, you'll watch the servers stand around for hours and then bring home twice as much as you do. The management was awful. The job was fun but the low pay made me hate being there."
bad,I liked my job but the management was not good. I learned that painting was enjoyable. I was very good and making the customers happy with their choices. I was always cleaning and making sure everything was straightened up.
bad,"had fun working with co-workers, always a new experience with customers. Management not the best, they had many favorite employees, always the same employees on committees others not given a chance. Management did not talk to employees nicely sometimes very rude."
bad,"This had to be the one job I couldn't stand, but where else will a broke college student find someone to work with her school schedule, or says they will anyway."
bad,"Did not really enjoy it."
bad,Home depot is a seasonal job.  All work  is related to change and a quick turn of related inventory.  Gained all expected training to make this become what a customer wants.
bad,"Definitely a hard place to work for. A lot of drama with coworkers and mangers. Not very family friendly, even though they say they are. They contradict themselves a lot and tell you to do one thing, then yell at you for that and tell you to do it a different way. very tough place to work. But customers are great!"
bad,"home depot claims that they put the customer first and the employee a close second. That is a lie. The Department supervisors are held to an understandably high standard however they are not allowed to make any real decisions or hold their people to account. "
bad,"As with many large companies, there are many procedures that are generalized. There is some room for growth, the most rewarding part is taking care of customers and my associates."
bad,Management at this store are not really involved with their associates they spend to much time in the back room and not enough time on the floor with customers.
bad,they cant get associates to stay they push very hard. no help to complete any job. they dont treat people correctly. they brow beat everyone. they talk down to you
bad,"I was doing more than what they pay me for.."
bad,"* 40% Managing cases from receipt, and escalating to the appropriate Advice and Counsel Manager when necessary."
bad,"I would like to say when i started it was a great company to work for, i started in garden growing up with a citrus knowledge. I was eager to learn and promote so i took training for all departments to increase my knowledge, which was provided by the company. Then I promoted up to Department Supervisor were I supervised about 20 associated. Promoted to Assist Manager, were I overseen the operation of the store, inventory, safety and the most important part was providing day in day out superior customer service to our customers. It was a Job I enjoyed in the beginning and enjoyed till the end. I would say the hardest part of the job is the amount of hours required from an Assist Manager 55hrs a week and there policy 1,2,3 strikes your out for not only for Mangers but associates also. And there was times due to the policy you had to let a go, long term or short time associate go which was difficult. And I dislike there new review cycle were they ladder rank there associates to determine there review score. But what i loved the most was the interactions with the  customers , making the sales, and the team building with the associates."
bad,"Co-workers are excellent but management doesn't recognize them unless they are their favourites, safety standards are usually met but not always,there are games throughout the year to create incentives, the hardest part of the job would be the lack of training and hours to train. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with fellow associates and helping the customers"
bad,Home Depot was originally US Remodelers. Home Depot wants you to work the store for free to get your own leads then make appointments. Management keeps you on the hook all the time. Poor quality over priced work. Bad reputation.
bad,"A typical at the home depot was just simple. Get in and clear the parking lot from shopping carts and bring them inside for customers. We had to assist customers with loading if they needed it. I learned how to do inventory, when i volunteered for the inventory team. The hardest part of the job was when i was power hour during peak hours and we had to keep shopping carts constant for the customers because it would run out. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers with their needs in the store."
bad,I found many challenges to work with during my time at the Home Depot.
bad,"Great company if you will be working at the corporate office. When hired for the Human Resource Associate I was very excited to be helping others. That excitement didn't last when I found out that I was going to be working in a call center, with ACD reports and calls waiting in que. Your overwhelmed with everything from timesheets, time edits, vacation, payroll, garnishments, Fmla, dealing with employees and store managers issues and complaints all while on a time limit. The call center environment takes the human out of service, especially if someone has cancer and your putting them out on leave and your time on that call is going over your minutes. Theres no room for advancement to get to the corporate office. The health  benefits are so expensive you can't afford them. I was single and looking at 160.00 to 200 a month to have their insurance. The pay is well below average starting at 15.15 which might be ok if they gave raises every 6 months instead its every year and its only about 9 to 20 cents Thats right 9-20 cent. Management is hit or miss because secretly there also looking to get out. If truly interested in working for Home Depot work at the store level, better opportunities and better pay."
bad,"The management at the store I worked at did not support its employees in their attempts to do the best job they could. The managers played favorites and played the employees off of one another in regards to promotions, raises and other incentives. This effected custoemr service and the reputaion of the company."
bad,"Management expected you to work 15+hours whenever they wanted you to then complain about how much overtime you had at the end of the week "
bad,"It is a fun place, good co-works. management is OK. I am learning to run new equipment to help in new job searches."
bad,"Take care of HD's ""BIG 3"" Customer Service, In-stock and Store appearance. Good old boy system gets you farther than working hard. Management is always stressed. Co-workers were great. Practically zero thanks from management for a job well done. I enjoyed helping customers."
bad,Stretched very thin due to staffing.  Co-workers were competent and did the best they could.  Management micromanaged and made it a very stressful situation.
bad,"generally assist customers with choosing paint colors and finishes. I'm constantly learning about new paint formulas and mixtures. Management in the paint department is virtually non-existent, if there is a problem usually a manager from a different department will try to help out if they're not busy."
bad,"Helping customers find the items they are looking for. Not just Hardware items, but other parts of the store as well"
bad,"The Management group was creating very stressful environment for employees, not any effort to apply job work/life balance. There was no positive feedback and luck of communication through out the store. Unfair promotion and no moral and motivation."
bad,A low paying part time job with little room for growth. Would only recommend students
bad,They were understaffed and I was often thrown into projects that I was unprepared for and unfit to perform. There was too much to do so we couldn't devote all of our time to our customers but were still expected to.
bad,"Co workers were nice and working with customers was fun, Typical work day was assisting customers and maintaining self inventory."
bad,Management did not seem to care about employees. Department heads do not carry their weight. Sudden schedule changes with no notice.
bad,Don't trust the management there nor any of the employees they may smile at your face but thats just it. The shift leaders will do whatever they can to make your life a living hell and will use any tactic they can find to get you to work extra hard but by their rules. Simple doesn't fly over at this place and everyone has to be a brain surgeon on how to get things done.
bad,no comment. It was a job!!!!!! The hardest thing was that you were on your feet for the total time of the day.
bad,Home Depot used to be a fun company to work for. Now it like working for the militia. Do something wrong and you're fired. Tisk tisk.... a lot of good people punished for poor management
bad,Too many employees for mgt. to know and respect. Computer generated schedules leaves everyone jumbled and scrambling to fix them. Disrespect and stress. Too much computer training that leaves employees feeling lost on the floor.
bad,"Long days, little guidance and management styles are vastly different."
bad,"This used to be a fantastic company to work for. There was a time when corporate understood they needed to take care of their employees so that their employees could take care of their customers. Now, all they care about is investing as little as possible in their people, while extracting the most from them."
bad,"clock in get a first phone,proceed to department do safety report,assist customers in their questions and needs,help mentor new associates in their job duties, clean the department and do shelf maintence to keep the department in stock. I learn about the new product in my area to better assist my customers. work together with managment on a daily basis ,cover other departments lunches and help if needed. the hardest part of my job is to insure that morral is up and that we have fun in what ever our position is in the work place, enjoy our customers! I like to have fun in everything i do and my customers see this and come back to me for help and a laugh. Its all about customer service!"
bad,Fellow associates were good to work with. Management was lacking in people skills except one Asst Mgr. .Hard to meet all the job quotas(7-8) based on economy. Enjoyed working with people.
bad,"Work was never too boring, I had experience in several departments: Paint, Garden, Floor & Wall, Hardware, & Electrical, plus cashiering. Even when I didn't know something or where it was, I was always able to help the customer find it or find another associate who'd know how to help. I really enjoyed working with people of all ages & cultures. Majority of customers were also pleasant, every now & then you might get some that were not having a good day & they could take it out on hard working individuals. Keeping up with the company's out of stock issue was not fun because they shipped mixed merchandise from their corporate warehouse & items did not always arrive- a constant battle. Management has changed, corporate seems to be interested in taking out employees with seniority to cut back on funds. Seems their values have become distorted."
bad,"The Home Depot is not as good a place to work as it once was.  Corporate decision making and the desire to make a profit no matter the cost have led the company to treat its store associates as expendable and the turn over rate is high.   While they offer success sharing the company is top heavy with the spoils of the labor going right to the top and the people who serve the customers , the associates, getting the leftovers. Prime example of the trickle down effect at work."
bad,The work day would start with stretches and them telling us about the numbers that we preformed at as far as productivity. I learn when it came to their company goes your supervisor are not worried about setting you up for success as long as you make them look good. My co-workers loved me as well as working with me they would come to me with a problem before they ever went to the supervisors. I would do anything i could to help anyone i worked with if i knew i had the answer they needed. The hardest part of my job was trying to get the supervisors to understand how they were making it hard for the associates to make good numbers because they never did the jobs they were over. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping those around me understand their jobs better and do it more productively and how to solve problems when they could not get a supervisor to help them.
bad,"A typical work day was receiving,sorting, and packing out all freight that filled receiving as well as customer service and sales . What I've learned is how to be my own boss of a company by being a supervisor twice in the past,as well as DIY skills,product knowledge,data entry,Reading and understanding Profit and Loss reports and customer service from start to finish.Managment has changed for the worst in the 15+ years I worked for this company they started thinking more about self financial gain than the customers and associates that help build this company.Co workers are fine some work some don't.The hardest part of this job was the lack of teamwork and urgency to get things done.The most enjoyable part of this job was always the customers and being able to solve there problem or just helping them with there needs so they could leave happy and hopefully gaining customers for life."
bad,"The expectations of senior management seemed to be totally tied to reports with respect to the operation of the company. Upon arrival in the morning you had to certify that your area was safe for both staff and customers, absolving home depot of any responsibility for accidents that might take place and assuming responsibility for the safety of the area yourself.Most of what was learned was learned at Lowe's and carried over into Home Depot. Fellow workers were extremely friendly and willing to help outside the workplace. The hardest part of the job was keeping current with the changes instituted by senior management after they disposed of all the trainers dealing with my level of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the public and trying to fit actuallities into their expectations and make them gladly accept reality."
bad,"i requested to work part time expecting an average of 15-20 hours per week and made it explicitly clear that that was the total time I wanted to work because i planned to go to school, but ended up being scheduled for 39 hours a week--just under full time."
bad,"Unhealthy environment"
bad,I used to get in bound calls at this call center after clients activated their home depot cards I would try to sell them identity protection plans. The job was simple and the pay was great and there was room for overtime hours. I got along with all of my coworkers I did this job fresh out of high school and almost everyone was in my age group.
bad,"I was the Operations Manager. I filled in as Acting Store Manager, Human Resource Manager, Loss Prevention. I loved the home improvement industry plus I enjoyed the HRM duties, team building, providing excellent customer service."
bad,Good place to work if your out of the service. Not if you're in your 20's-30's. 
bad,"Get to work and be overloaded with orders to pull for delivery for the day and only have a few hours to complete them, by myself, before the truck arrived. I sometimes would be stuck at work longer than my scheduled shift because I was the only weekend order puller and I had to get everything pulled before the next days deliveries. "
bad,Customer Service directly related company. This company keeps employees knowledgeable about the company and products. 
bad,as my position of a lot associate at home depot i hated it i was supposed to clean the lot of carts and load stuff into customer vehicles and most times i was by myself during the busiest times of day  i would be running back and forth from one end of the store to the other and constantly getting calls for carry outs and was somehow supposed to clean the lot at the same time  i felt that the management didnt care about their employees i worked very hard but wasnt treated very well  i was forced to work part time only  with mayb 25 hrs or less a week but worked 5 days a week the strangest shifts possible  and alot of times i would close at 930 and then have to open at 630 the next morning it was very difficult to balance life and work  and many other part time employees i talked to felt the same way   and there was no room for advancement into a full time position    in my opinion home depot is a terrible company to work for  
bad,horrible team work and team effort for a team job if i go on there wont be enough room
bad,"As a retail employee you need to have patience and lots of it. What i learned from working at this job is to work and do the best of your ability. Management on the other hand is a whole different topic. going through five to 6 different bosses ib a span of 3 months makes life pretty stressful. Adjust to each different manager demands and needs is very draining at times. Coworkers were good as i was the youngest member on the team at the time, the older coworkers gave me great insight and taught to stay positive and move forward. i also made some that are friends for life, and the hardest part of the day was no having any help at times due to short staff."
bad,"The schedule is grueling, sometimes only 5 hours between shifts. Best part of the job was helping the customer. Worst part was the unrealistic expectations of management to complete tasks. "
bad,Not able to advance. Department continue to get shuffled around until a huge downsizing eliminated newer people. Kept the old even if they were not good employees.
bad,"Management has no idea what there doing, the only ones that do anything are the ones that walk around looking for reasons to write up ppl for any little thing. Supervisors let leads do there job because there lazy and/or have know idea what there doing. Pay and time off is terrible. Bonuses aren't much and you bust butt to get them maybe 100$ every few months. Hardly any overtime maybe a few hours every month or two. Unless you really need a job stay away."
bad,When i worked there all it was were people trying to show who had more authority than the others. People tried to be your friend just to gain personal information to try and black mail you with. I did my job very well and still got fired because they didn't want to hand me my bonus check. They try to instill in you a place that appreciates hard workers when in all reality its a place were you got to know someone just to get to the top.
bad,"A typical day at Home Depot is coming in being prepared for a short staff and I feel if they cared a little more about the associates they would have more employees. I have learned that no matter what a customer is always right and management makes sure of that. The hardest part of my job is that i have to come to work in a not so friendly environment but most of all i love the customers, they will make your day even if you are in a bad mood"
bad,"Home Depot is not a fun place to work. They manage by intimidation and there are too many layers of management trying to justify their jobs that don't really contribute, thus making it harder on the associates at the store."
bad,The work is very demanding. When you get hired they usually keep the new people for three months and then let you go.
bad,"Take care of customers and their orders, as wells as handle money."
bad,The management is the biggest downfall at the home depot. The compensation is the biggest downfall of the comapany.
bad,I currently work at Lowe's after working at Home Depot for almost 7 years. The management of the store was horrible and has no clue what is going on. You literally move things over and over because they cant make up their mind where they want them or how they want it set up. They pay less than Lowe's and their bonuses are a joke.
bad,I have been with THD for 3 years. I am still doing the same job. The only eay to advance is to be male. Management sucks and changes regularly.
bad,The management was poor but the money was good for retail and while going to college. The benefits were good because you could receive them if you were part time. The work was okay but it could be stressful at times.
bad,I worked at the Home Depot for 12 years it was a pretty good company but the mangers need some help..
bad,"as i would say its a job. for the most part it is favortism in the job. the longer u been there the better , and also depends who you know and wat you know. typical day on the job would be clock in report to the front end supervisor get assigned my registers do my duties and then go home when my shift is done. to move up in the job you have to really chase managers and employees to help you. you would be better off learning on your own and not bothering any one"
bad,"a typical day consisted of answering phones call, doing phone call orders, cleaning and organizing my work area, will calls, returns,stocking, call list, and credit card applications."
bad,"I can't speak for all stores, but the store I work for has very poor management, and has very few opportunities for advancement if you have any kind of pigment to your skin. Hours are cut drastically, (only to give management bigger bonus checks), causing it to be very difficult to maintain rent and bills. (I was $700 behind!) The health insurance benefits are hardly beneficial at all. With the lowest rate plan, without vision coverage, $120 is deducted from your check every month, before taxes! Prescription coverage is only $35, and there is a deductible of $100 every month. The insurance only covers $500 a year for doctor visits. The scheduling is ridiculous, especially now that they have this new computer program that creates the schedule. For example, you could be scheduled to work 1:30pm-10:30pm (or later depending on your position, and how many customers are still in the store after closing hours), and then be scheduled to work 5am-2pm the next day! I could go on with this review of Home Depot, or as I like to call it ""The Plantation,"" but I'm afraid someone ""important"" might see it and fire me. (and they definitely won't hesitate to try to get rid of you if you come from a line of people with skin of a darker hue)"
bad,"A typical day was either opening or closing the front end of the store. I was either running a cash register, a returns register, filling a special order, cleaning, stocking, answering phones, directing customers or helping load customers cars."
bad,"One supervisor told me ""if they want someone out they do things to make them quit or get them written up til they are fired""."
bad,The associates are friendly and corteous but the wait is sometimes delayed.
bad,"After 17 years with Home Depot, I am sorry to say poor and I wood not recommend this company."
bad,"The management team does not share knowledge with others. You are basically left alone to discover the ways in which the company operates. Promotions are based on friendships and not knowledge. Many supervisors of extraordinary talent are over looked and disrespected by the promotions of less capable employees. Management does not have the type of value and culture needed in today's global economy. Diverse in appearence, but lacking in implementation. Human resources does not work on behalf of employees, instead they work to allow management to mistreat, harass, intimidate, and fire employees for any reason they see fit. Google lawsuits against Home Depot and you will find numerous sites depicting the mistreatment of employees. It's a sad scenario of how this company has forgotten how to be HUMAN!!! The associates at Home Depot are great. They work extremely hard and then they discover how the system works and they become disgruntled. It is not the fault of the employees, rather a problem with the execution of the values Home Depot claims that it has."
bad,The associates I worked with are great. The Managers that they changed too were horrible you cannot trust them because they will back stab you.
bad,"By Far The Worst Company I Have Ever Wored For. You Will get Little To No Hours, You Don't always get your break on time and that is if you get it at all. The mangement Team shows little to no respect for the workers...Its Just A BIG MESS!!"
bad,"I worked here for a few months,and i learned to make keys. It was interesting."
bad,Good for those still attending school. Flexible hours suited for any one looking a little added income as well. Not a long term career option.
bad,"Break room is so full of negative people that it's not even a break room anymore.  3 managers, 2 to disagree and maybe one who sometimes might agree - no loaders available for large orders, the younger associates don't seem to realize that they need to work for their paychecks and not let the older employees do all the closing work (emptying trash, dusting, doing floors in their area).  It appears that they get a good giggle out of watching someone who has to have a job do the work. Lunch hours and breaks seem to be up to just anyone who wants to tells you what to do.  When I first started my job, I had a lot of respect for my supervisor, he ran a tight ship.  When he transferred to another supervisory position everything changed for the front end."
bad,"The stores are understaffed due to lack of available labor and low wages."
bad,"Starting my work at this location was almost a dream. We had caring management and work went fast but, that slowly faded with time as management left and were replaced with newer people it all went down hill. It was probably just my location,  the company itself seemed alright."
bad,not a bad company to work for just not for me . the company does stretch you thin most times and doesnt want to compensate you with adequate pay for your work.
bad,"Most floor associates are great people. Older associates are very knowledgeable about a variety of topics."
bad,This is a male dominated industry.  They have their token female managers but the assistant manager at our store is a hot headed physically large intimidating man.  Team work and co operation is not encouraged and I have to watch my back.  I wonder how they became a Fortune 50 company...unless it was on the backs of their employees.
bad,Do not become salaried!!! This company will work you 18 hrs plus. You will work a full shift go home to shower and have to come back again. Retail so always working holidays.
bad,"The Home Depot I worked at was a nightmare. One of the managers, and the general manager was the worst manager I've ever had in my life. They do not care about you or your safety. This Home Depot was the one in Woodbridge NJ. Other Home Depots are better but this one was a headache and paid me terribly for how many hours and hoe hard I worked. I highly recommend working else where."
bad,I was hired as a supervisor and was not told what department. I came from another company as an operations Supervisor  but when I started there I was told that I would be a cashier supervisor. That wasn’t the best position for me since I came from running the truck team not being a cashier. In the beginning i got to watch videos and then was told to get out there and help cashier never to train again.
bad,"No employee discount..."
bad,Expect a lot of work for less pay. benefits are good. customer service is  horrible and management is horrible. work every weekend never the same time
bad,"A typical day of work would see you starting at 6am. Working a huge parking lot by yourself to get it clean before customers start coming in."
bad,I had a great time working with contractors and engineers on their new ideas and agile work. Many challenges but the teams I worked with always had high spirit and results oriented.
bad,"Pay is generous in management positions, but the management at this level is less concerned about their people and very much only focuses on the bottom line and self-promotion. Culture is good for entry level associates for the most part, but the higher up you go in management has unrealistic expectations, don't value your opinions and develops their staff very little, if at all."
bad,"This company was a good company to work for. I gained a lot of experience working for the Home Depot.  I built displays, executed pricing, signage, stocked product and set planograms."
bad,"Extremely short staffed, when asked for help I never received any. When asked to move to a different department I was demoted to part-time cashier. My supervisor was extremely rude, even after reporting her multiple times nothing was done since she had worked there for years and was close to SM. SM did nothing to make me feel more comfortable, never even spoke about the situation when they claim they’re a “family” and “employees come first”"
bad,"I was a cashier at The Home Depot in Provo Utah, so this review applies to the cashier position at that location. The Home Depot places a credit card quota on their cashiers, and if they don't hand out enough credit cards, they get wrote up. "
bad,"Company tries but falls short. Relatively new (and awesome) flexible work opportunities, Starbucks, gym, daycare, drugstore on main campus really make it easy to take care of business, and sometimes take it easy, at work. Decent opportunities to learn via internal and external courses. Average benefits. You have to be on the right team for the org to feel great. "
bad,"I would not recommend working at home Depot unless it was a summer job or part time.I was full time and had to request one weekend off a month, and would sometime not even get that."
bad,Because of the policy of sending workers home if business is slow (some at the door and others who had been there anywhere from one hour to three hours) the morale is very low.
bad,The only way to get promoted at this store is by kissing up to the managers that kiss up to their managers. If you work hard and do your job you aren’t rewarded the way you should be.
bad,"At home depot honestly anyone can get hired. They just want someone willing to work and put in the hours. I will say it is a lot of manual labor. A lot of walking and picking up merchandise. Some departments are more difficult then others but not by a lot. Management will leave you out to dry. Customers can be very rude so you have to be level headed. "
bad,"short was not to the point talked about a lot of things not affiliated to a job"
bad,If I do not have an answer to this question. Very dissatisfied with the last minute of letting me know my service was no longer needed. I was given a chance for the cashier position and the reason was they no long needed cashier. Why were they advertising cashier needed.
bad,Management is very two face. They one thing and do another. It's very black and white. Bad place to work. A lot of people get away with things other people don't. You have to be in a group to get ahead.
bad,"You get treated like a dog on busy days or when corporate pops up. Most employees kiss butt to get ahead and gossip too much. You don’t get paid enough for the verbal abuse the customers put you through and to top it off the schedule will make sure you won’t have a home life. Bottom line, choose an employer that will push you for all the right reasons."
bad,That management is nice at first but it wont take long before they start treating you poorly they don't try and understand their associates needs and that they shut their air conditioning off after store closes so if you are working past then expect to roast in the summer time not the best place for employment.
bad,Health insurance is too expensive. They expect too much out of employees that only start out making $15/hr. Performance system is hard to meet on a daily basis. They look for ways to get rid of you so they can get new hires. Supervisors think they are better than you and look down on you. The operations manager I have was fired from his last job  if that tells you anything.
bad,"I would not recommend the home depot to new graduates. Hours were long and I would carry heavy items that exceeded 100 lbs. Supervisor and managers were unprofessional. "
bad,"Started out as a good job, and after a while I started to see the managers true colors. They start out being friendly and then become not so understanding."
bad,Hard work gets no reward; management team does not support its employees. They make you come to work injured to make maximum safety days; favoritism is rampant when it comes to promotions
bad,You are over worked and under paid. The respect level between management and associates isn't the best. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"I'm not saying that all Home Depots are bad but the one I work at was.  Incompetend management, not wanting to hire more people to get the jobs done.  Not very friendly to there workers.  All around not a very nice place to work.  I tell people that aswell.  I tell them to go to lowes, they actually help people there."
bad,"They pay you a few cents more than minimum wage- literally!"
bad,"The Home Depot is first and fore most a very retail environment. You will feel ""squeezed"" between serving all sorts of customer personalities, and the pressure from supervisors and managers making you sign them up for the store's own credit card. The scheduling is the worst of it. It is inconsistent and they almost always make employees work through weekends. Again, this after management ""cherry-picks"" who can move the most Home Depot credit cards. These employees are the ones who get the best Day shifts that end by 6 pm or earlier. The two days employees get ""off "" per week are never the same two days off each week. They are different each week and are posted to workers 3 weeks in advance. In spite of the store closing at 9 pm, if you're a closer, expect to still be there wiping down counters, emptying garbage, and organizing shelves until 10:30 pm. Personality conflicts are common, which affects morale etc. etc."
bad,"Worked here because I had a previous stint at a home depot before hand. It was a two minute walk from school, and it covered my monthly rent. The job was easy and they worked around my school schedule. Lots of drama between co-workers. Poor moral"
bad,Felt like I received little gain out of the job since my hard work seemed to go unnoticed. Too little pay for the amount of demands required by management and supervisors.
bad,fine short-term job. really great coworkers but terrible management. no communication. no job security. thrown onto the floor with very minimal job training.
bad,"Politics play a big role if you want to advance in the company, for example if you need a raise and you know of someone in a high place you'll get a raise, same for the having weekend's off. Its a corporate company they view you as a number not a person.... the managers are thee worst example's from the Store Managers and up. It is surely not the same company I worked for before. The values have changed and greed took over."
bad,I care not to speak ill of a company or those who still work there.  Management has been a disappointment and growth is non-existent in the current environment.
bad,"When I first started there was a very close culture. Everyone actually enjoyed their jobs and were quite welcoming. Recent Company policies though put more workload with less compensation, driving away valuable employees that made the work environment friendly and fun. People who've ben there decades plus were looking for work else where because the workload didnt allow for much home time. You'd frequently be asked to work over but then be told to cut your OT. Even high school kids were pulling 10 and 12 hour shifts.. The pay hasnt kept up with other retail work and the success sharing portion isnt worth the amount of work and knowledge youre expected to have.. Specially credit cards, Leads/Services. Cashiers are made to constantly pester the customers for a page long script asking for surveys, credit cards and services the store provides or be written up. While others stores dont have this. Associates are expected from the customers as well as management to have a certain level of knowledge that rivals a handyman thats been doing the job for years. while being paid the same as a retail worker. The day to day job wasnt hard initially but they added unattainable goals that put unnecessary pressure on associates with little return."
bad,"Pay is minimal. I know Lowe's and Walmart pay more per hour to start after talking to them. "
bad,"I wouldnt recommend this job unless you plan on sucking up to the management hard just for a $1 or $2 pay raise. The annual pay raises are normally 20 cents for regular employees. Its very corrupt, and corporate doesnt care about you one bit. Your skills and abilities mean nothing, and the pay reflects that. If you are a high school kid, or an old person thats bored then home depot is an easy place to get hired. If you are neither of those then stay away from home depot. You will get nothing out of it in terms of a career."
bad,"Used to be a pretty alright job until we got a new supervisor. Too much favoritism (And you'll know who by who the supervisor chooses to talk to, All. The. Time). The work load can also drag on with things such as general service boiling down to simply standing around for 10 minutes (in over 200 bays), and being given barely any other work to do (And don't even think about multitasking, every task is on a set time per week and as such, this job also isn't great for teamwork). All in all, this is not a job I could recommend unless it's all you got."
bad,"I recently quit the home depot because of the horrible management. I was not paid for vacations I took, intermittent FMLA paperwork not filed and lost, management making promises that they did not stick to or intend to stick to, overall attitude of management to employees, covering multiple departments because of walk offs and management did not cover shifts."
bad,"Whenever I had an issue that I couldn't resolve come up, I was met immediately that ""we're understaffed right now, I can't help you - figure it out."" Leaving customers vehement in some cases. It was unfortunate at times."
bad,"I will warn you before you apply for a Customer Service Representative position in the Contact Center. It is not what you will be expecting. You think you are working in the ""Chat"" Department and then it turns into ""Messaging"" which includes SMS now. Then they will start scheduling you to be on the phones. All of your paperwork and documents in the system says Customer Service Representative/ Chat but now you keep getting put on phones. If you DO NOT want to be on the phones and taking customer calls, DO NOT apply for a Chat position. They preach about this whole Core Values and taking care of our people but they do not take care of their employees. They will say stuff in training to make it sound great but, it is all a lie. There are VERY few career advancements (they do not want to hire internally unless its customer service focused), the merit is a joke, and the metrics is all they are focused on which one question has everything to do about Home Depot and not the Customer Service Representative themselves. Home Depot worries so much about the metrics however, when you put Chat associates on SMS or Phones it does not help their metrics get better because it does not count for them when they change focus jobs. Do not worry about associates metrics when you put them in a position that does not help them."
bad,A typical day at Home Depot consists of a lack of help from management and a stressful work environment due to other departments lack of ability to do their own work.
bad,my typical day starts off kind of slow cause we got there at 5. i learned a lot about bays and how to set them up proper. the management was OK we worked as a team but we was at different spots of the store. my work place culture was all mixed races. the hardest part of my job was finding where everything belonged or where the product was located in the store because people miss place items. the most enjoying part of my job was when i finally find what i was looking for cause it could take all day and im not just doing one thing at a time so it will come to me when im doing something else.
bad,"La paga es muy baja, se publican dentro de la empresa  posibles vacantes para crecimiento, pero siempre buscan el como No dejarte crecer."
bad,"I would not go back to work for home depot if my life depended on it.  The company only gives raises every 12 months.  They try and tell you its cause you get an annual bonus but thats if the store makes its magical sales number.  If you are a motivated hard worker, they wont compensate you, they will abuse you.  Dont think you will be going to work for home depot and be around a bunch of motivated veterans.  The veterans there were some of the sloppiest, laziest people there."
bad,"opening and closing stores, learn from management, have fun and build relationships with colleagues, associates managements and customers.great benefits, online training,"
bad,"Stressful environment, a lot of favoritism. Only a few associates did all the work. As one of the few who did work it was disheartening to see others who did not work get promoted and get higher pay increases."
bad,I can only speak for my store but it's a kind of high school mentality that only seems to allow friends to advance. They seem to expect one person to accomplish everything.
bad,made working there unbearable in the sense that no one wanted to work so it carried a very slow placed working environment and very little people wanted to help out. The few who already had that mentally of helping stayed in the spot light but always got pulled to do to much and by the end of the day exhausted and hated working just as much as the slow paced coworkers.
bad,the management made a lot of promises that they would not follow through with. The customers made the job enjoyable. They do not offer discounts on products nor do they offer full time except for very few people.
bad,"I was excited about working here because of the ""opportunities in growing"" with the company were there. its just a lot of favoritism and a**kissing for you to move up.. I worked the hours scheduled and when I would get called to help out. for almost two years I did all of the hard work looking to move up but I was never considered as a promotable associate even after covering and stepping up for my supervisor while he was out. management hardly does anything but complain about you not doing something. supervisors an associates are the ones running the store, truly no need for an assistant manager.."
bad,I worked as a lot technician at the store on 1336 Bristol Pike in Bensalem long story short there's about two or three individuals actually do their jobs the rest of the lot text just walked around evading their duties some of them got fired but there's one individual has been there for 7 years and nothing happens to him when you're loading propane he looks at you and walks away the Lot Lotsalways a mess on his shift even when we're not busy and you're expected to perform his duties for him someone had brought a letter from the doctor saying that they can't be out in the heat when it's 95 degrees plus with their diabetic condition and they ignored it Sapore work culture and they talked to the lot text like their meals there's only two or three head cashiers that actually care about the staff but the rest of the management they don't give it a second thought avoid this store
bad,"It used to be about taking care of the customer,but now but now it's all about shareholder value."
bad,"Wouldn't promote because i was to fast and productive. Couldn't Move up or out of out bound, I hurt my neck when a poorly stacked pallet fell on me and they still didn't move me from the position."
bad,"People there were not friendly. "
bad,"If you are someone that loves helping people in large quantity as fast as you can just for the satisfaction of the happy smile on the customers face, this is the job for you. So throw on your Nascar Cap and prep your engines to surpass the greatest goal you've ever accomplished!"
bad,"Most of my co workers were under qualified and performed poorly. Management was detached and stopped listening to customers and employees. Our annual pay increase would not meet inflation, so although we received a pay rase it economically is worth less. "
bad,At first I was excited to work there the people were great and it seemed really beneficial to work there. But as time went everything went spiraling downhill the work ended up getting more and more difficult. The supervisors would move you around constantly making it difficult to do your job and do it well.
bad,"The Managers only worried about self, never even to the time to ask you how arr you doing.. Had there picks and favorites they would choose for advancement.. Some of the top people in Atlanta was the same way. If any thing arises don't nobody stand up for there fellow associate. They are willing to throw u under the bus in a heart beat.."
bad,"Never enough help, thats one of the biggest issues working here. With the new working model they have fewer associates on at one time but still expect the same amount of work to be done. Sometimes there will be one associate closing 2-3 departments by themselves. Needless to say something has to change."
bad,"They offer a pool and pingpong table as well as a tv and video games. They try to make it a fun place to be. The largest downfall would be the lack of accountability for management. They have also create a 'pass the buck' mindset, which also reflects on the way we can and cannot assist the customers."
bad,the position was part time only working no more than 20 hours per week. it was a night time position. there was no room for advancement to other positions.
bad,"Never going back to this greedy corporation. Managers do not back up their employees, they only cover their butts.. this is a greedy corporation. I worked for them for five years and worked way harder then I should have for the money I made."
bad,"If you like doing someone else’s job and getting paid very little to do it while being micro-managed and harrassed then Home Depot is the place for you. The job itself is actually fun, however the half assed leadership and disregard for your safety/family/life is very off putting."
bad,"Generally you are overworked for your job. Management can be very unprofessional, unpredictable and treat you in a condescendingly disrespectful way. Your needs aren't taken seriously unless you call the main hub line to get it fixed and even then there is a large list of paperwork involved to get a minor accommodation. Meanwhile, they expect you to do everything that want you to without training you properly for weeks. Managers also tend to be hypocritical, able to treat customers rudely and yell but their employees below them are reprimanded."
bad,I ok if a college student but if not it's a no go. They don't give fair raises and didn't give over they make you take a super long lunch the last day of work for the week. Say you work 45 hours they won't let you leave early so you take like 2 5 hour lunches.
bad,"Customers are able to disrespect the workers,and workers are not able to say anything back. Constantly busy and the management is usually bad. Home Depot treats its workers more like criminals than actual criminal themselves. Management picks favorites with people."
bad,Typical days are repetitive. Overtime is rare unless you are a department manager. The people are mostly friendly. The pay is very low especially considering the area. Raises and advancement are not plentiful.
bad,"I would have loved to continue to work at Home Depot. The pay was great and most people were friendly, but everything else lacked. I never knew who my manager was. I had a lot of illness issues, but Home Depot took no excuses, and I was yelled at multiple times for being sick. Customers looked down upon me and frequently called me names that made me uncomfortable (sweetheart, honey, kiddo)."
bad,"People are only looking out for themselves, not really willing to help others. I am the only one who can help customers load their purchases into their vehicles."
bad,After nearly 6 years of loyalty to the company. Ive got nothing to show for it besides badges that show I'm good at customer service and an hourly wage 30cents over the store minimum. If you're looking for a starter job it's great but not for long term
bad,insufficient training to be successful at your job. Customers get rude when you can't answer all their needs.Your schedule changes constantly. Expect to work every weekend. Either Saturday. or Sunday.
bad,"Responsible for managing controllable expenses, managing and creating budgets. Responsible for ensuring that the store was set to sales plan on a weekly basis."
bad,"Very few are willing to understand and help. Some discriminate eventhough they say no discrimination tolerated. I have been harrassed for the 2 years i work here the days are his or miss if its going to be a good day or not."
bad,They say that they support you to move up in the company but they don't.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.  This is not a company that you stay at long term
bad,Management is poor and should work better with their associates. I tried going to days to have more time with my family and there you had to be on a list which wasn't right.
bad,"working for MET team has little reward.. Never fast enough, good enough. Double standards and hypocrisy is rampant. Training is horrible, sit in front of a computer and your trained. Supervisors behave as though they are above you, constantly watching everything you do and nagging. You are never right even if you are. Speaking up and defending yourself is frowned upon and gets you nowhere.Area manger hears but doesn't listen. Filthy, dirty, dusty. You are the paid less than the janitorial staff {who work hard, lots of respect to them] but are expected to do all of in store cleaning. Always short staffed because no one wants the job. Working fulltime hours and no fulltime benefits because you're part time. Annual raise is a few cents, if you get a good review. Part time can get as low as 0 hours, yes, zero. If you desperately need a job, go for it. But you will be kept at the poverty line. Minimum wage. Supervisor, minimal increase an hour. Learning forklift, order picker gets you no more money. Very unfulfilling work. Glorified maintenance staff."
bad,Pay is decent for an individual but not to support a family. Job advancement is only achievable if your willing to relocate to another store. Employees don't have a sense of urgency to take care of customers in a timely manner.
bad,"If you have bills, this isn't the job for you. Inconsistent  hours, only PT available, no medical offered, no job advancement. Employees are not placed where their skills are utilized"
bad,"The Home Depot has consistently lied to me about pay and advancement, while propagating a toxic and deeply problematic work environment. I was criminally abused for the first few months of my employment by my supervisor, a meth-addict who was stealing from the company and showing pornography to associates. Despite management claiming I was getting raises, my pay never exceeded minimum wage. Management actively lied to myself and other coworkers about advancement, and consistently displayed apathy towards worker conditions and pay."
bad,Too corporate for me. Hard workers don't get advanced. The ones who know how to play the game get advancement. Easy for lazy employees to hide. Happens a lot.
bad,"There were numerous times I had to do someone's job for them because they were hiding in the break room. A lot of my coworkers were nice and kind but no one was motivated to do their own job. I also tried working at a different location after I left my hometown for school, and the company did not care what situation I was in as a broke college student. I probably didn't get a response from them 4 months after applying and I'm still waiting for ""phone call"" I was promised. For those wanting to work for this company, call your store and almost harass them everyday until you get the job. Good luck to anyone applying because I clearly didn't have any."
bad,"I loved working with some customers and coworkers. The benefits are also good. But, they really need to improve communications,safety, fair pay, support,discipline and more.. I have more to say but, I'll just leave it like this. And it's not a really good answer either."
bad,"This is job is only meant for retired people and those who want to make a little extra cash. Do not make this your primary job. You cannot depend on this job alone part time or full time. Schedules are awful and inconsistent. As for as pay and raises go, you get maybe $11/hr or so depending on your location and only .33 cents a year raise after that. Success sharing is a joke, I received $100 BEFORE taxes. Meanwhile, upper management makes a lot of money from success sharing though. Example: The store manager gets a bonus that is nearly half his/her salary if they are number one in the district. Management will push sales so they get their bonuses. Customers are super needy and will bug you."
bad,"I've worked for their competitor, and while I had my issues with Lowe's, Home Depot was by far the worst.  The management style was harsh and they did nothing for employee development.  "
bad,"I worked on the MET Team and it was a 6 to 3 job.  The pay was very low. I learned that it's political, and I didn't enjoy the job or culture. The best part of the experience was receiving a new job."
bad,"A stressful employer to work for. The cliche ""what are you going to do for me today"" is very true with Home Depot. Never mind what you have done for them in the past. Its what you are going to do today."
bad,"The lie that is provided that The Home Depot is a team environment is not known by the outside world. Management is only concerned about stuffing their bonuses at the expense of cutting part time hours and forcing employees to work by themselves within an entire department. Management supports favoritism around the store, providing awards solely to employees they are friends with. If you want to work at a place that will give you more money than the minimum wage, apply here. However, you will never be content with management. The issue with The Home Depot is neither the employees nor the supervisors, it is management who are to blame for all the problems within the store."
bad,"Great coworkers, easy job, horrible management. No guaranteed fixed hours, reported issues go unsolved. Disrespect from management. Hard to get ahold of the person who schedules/does sick time/financial work."
bad,"The management hold no accountability toward those that do not work. The store I worked in had favorites, if you were a favorite you could do what you want( i.e. bully other associates, stay on your phone, stand around talking to management in the back office, take lunch w/o clocking out). Those that were less fortunate, or not liked by ""the favorites"" were usually hounded by management, or shunned entirely."
bad,Speaking specifically for the Home Depot on bannister the management finds ways to bend the rules only to benefit themselves. They care mostly about only making sales for the week and at this particular Home Depot you don’t get a lot of business and in return the demand gets higher even when they fire someone every other week. Your fellow associates are great and will help you with anything as long as a supervisor doesn’t see it because they want you to learn on your own.
bad,Back when i was hired this job was mostly professional. The management was fair. Although i never revived any discounts the job was for the most part bearable.
bad,"Definitely not for a slacker, but if you are clean and not on drugs, this is a great company to keep you alive. When HD was started they paid retired pros a good salary, now they start everybody at the bottom even if you have all the experience in the world. If you started in the 70's you are a rich person."
bad,not such a great place for advancement. does not have work ethics and its who you know for advancement. the pay is horrible. does not help the associates and management does not care
bad,"Good place to work if you enjoy chugging the corporate kool-aid. The grunts are replaceable in managements eyes, pay does not reflect profit for HD. Port in a storm, nothing else."
bad,The store manager at the time I work there was completely unfair. She made promises that she did not keep. I kept on asking for a full time position and she said when it is available she would give it to me and never did. I saw several people get full time before me. Spoke to me like a was a child and belittling coworkers and myself in front of customers. I would never recommend this place if work to anyone.
bad,"Being employed at the home depot taught me to be a team player, marketing skills, and to work hard for positions desired. I worked in several positions while employed there including cashier, paint, flooring, and appliances."
bad,"The biggest issue with working at the home depot (especially as it concerns long term employment) is that the store manager is forced to switch locations every few years or so. I worked in spurts at two different home depots essentially as a summer job when I wasn't away for school. In between that time the management change was drastic. My review of the store would have been entirely 5 starts if it hadn't been for the management change. The work environment became volatile and cut throat as he had decided to begin cutting hours, laying off employees and intentionally under staffing the store to save money at Christmas time. A management change at the store can be so drastic that your very job security and the work environment as a whole could change in a matter of weeks."
bad,"Some workers would help you but then take your orders without letting you know.  This lead to you having incomplete orders in the system and management on you as to why."
bad,Home depot is a great company but the management at my particular store sucked. There is opportunity for growth but usually have to relocate to different store to grow. Do your own research
bad,Poor upper management and no career advancement. Value wheel is not supported by most upper level management. New ideas are not encouraged or supported
bad,The store is based on drama. If people have worked there longer than you and they say anything about you everyone hears about it. Full of people who love drama and making others look bad.
bad,Company did not help disable or handicap employee or accommodate the work space for such workers. Company need to look out for their most valuable worker
bad,The work environment is good management sucks learned how to mix paint with all verity of colors. the most enjoyable part of the job is every 6 months everyone in the whole store gets a raise a check and paycheck same week.
bad,"Things could be better if there was better management. There was a lot of favoritism shown to certain associates by the management. Also there were associates who would ""spy"" on other associates in order to get in good with the management."
bad,i worked for them for two years and only received 2 raises.the raises were 25 cents once a year and they refused to work with my schedule needs or give me the hours i needed to pay my bills. as part time youre only entitled to very limited benifits. and they are no different than if you went and got them yourself.
bad,"While working as a manager for this company I worked on average 10-12 hrs daily. In my opinion the pay was fair, I did appreciate the stocks that could be earned for managers. The benefits were average.The opportunities for advancement in the upper level of leadership were slim to none."
bad,The environment within Home Depot is one that is easy to survive in due to he manner in which they treat the resources. Overall I think that you have to be aggressive to survive within their culture.
bad,"I didn't like the job. The atmosphere was ""If you complain about anything you can be replaced"" I noticed a shoplifter and they told me they didn't care about theft. They said that they sell in such bulk that theft is miniscule. Besides they remarked, we have insurance."
bad,"Relaxed environment. Non professional. (esp when it comes to management) Very little room to advance if any. Been with the company almost 2 years and have applied to over 52 open positions for full time; with no results. With every job, there are drawbacks. Hardest part of the job is during slow hours if you are front end. It can be maddening. There is no workplace culture; unless you are in the 'clique', you're sadly S.O.L."
bad,"I worked part time. low pay, but good discount, not sure how working in upper level would be. this was a high school job, and at the time that was all I needed,"
bad,Training is the most flex you get with this company. Hours for part time never exceed 25 hours a week. Shifts are all over. Its the coworkers that make or break the experience and the company.
bad,"Great job for high school students, the pay is not that great and the cash registers are located close to the door so you freeze in the winter time it’s really not worth the pay"
bad,Home Depot is not very competitive wage wise. They are not in line with other employers. The scheduling is not very good. One day you work an opening shift and the next day a closing one. Plan on working every holiday.
bad,Management just cares too much about the numbers. Associates are last on their list. We are underpaid and management expects us to provide excellent customer service without the proper department coverage. It used to be a fun place to work for but now the culture has become all about numbers.
bad,"The management is very poor, the company claims safety is number one to them, but when I worked there, I saw, and heard of three forklift accidents. There is a very high turnover rate. As a cashier, they didn't give me enough stuff to do. I mostly stood around and waited for customers."
bad,"There for 8 1/2 years thought it was a great place to advance fairly quickly in my first few years, however it depends almost solely on management, if management doesn’t like you for any reason you will not go anywhere in the company. Show up, do your job, don’t have an option about anything and do whatever you are asked good or bad and you may move up."
bad,"Zero training, management refused to assist with anything, many injuries from lifting over weight products, even up ladders. "
bad,"I thought I would be doing more flower design as i was trained for, but that was the smallest part of my job. "
bad,It was a good job but getting up 2am really wasn’t the best option and at that the benefits sucked and the work hours sucked.. good company though. They did a lot of holiday stuff but the pay and benefits weren’t the best
bad,"Unfunded mandate regularly"
bad,"Home Depot is a decent but not one to take to serious, They ask for more then they pay and management ranges form decent to poor. I have been working for Home Depot for 7 years they try to sale you a dream and make you think they care about you but they only care for what you can do for the store and help them get more money as you stay trying to scrape for pennies. anyone can do the job it super easy so it's a good stepping stone just don't get invested in it and leave the first chance you can."
bad,"Only way to make money is to become a manager and that lessens your job security. Even to move up in the company it's all about who are favorites with, it is not a fair advantage"
bad,"bad managers who would yell at you for things you didnt do. i told them i was going to school and cant work 40hrs a week as a part time employee. they said ok,  i got 2 weeks at 25 hrs then it went right back up to 40. I left because of their dishonesty."
bad,Homedepot is a job opportunity that i would recommend only because they strive for greatness and overall they make there employees feel that they care about personal and work related matters
bad,"It was really bad. Management was poor. After moving from nights to days, the team spirit was lacking and management was terrible. When I left, a lot of people left with me."
bad,Home depot have very bad management its a lot of favor tism towards the employees they are friends with and treat others different i feel everyone should be treated equally
bad,"Would not recommend working for Home Depot.  Hours are all over the place and management could care less about other obligations.  Started you at a decent wage when I started in 2007, I've been told that's not the case anymore."
bad,The staff seems never to be around when there is a customer that needs assistance.  I had just started there and there was never anyone around to help me answer customer's questions.
bad,"management is terrible "
bad,"Management team is absolutely horrible. They do not care about the workers, they are a bunch of lazy people when needed they are no where to be found ever"
bad,"They do offer really good benefits. And this company is good for those who want to be in the retail home improvement business. The pay, however, is and always will be an issue for many of the employees there. They are always short-handed with all their cut-backs. With all of those cut-backs, their customer-service suffers, despite their emphasis on that customer-service."
bad,"You can expect low pay with high demands.  Home Depot is great for part timers.  You might say that it is only for the part time associates that the company operates.  There is high turn over here.  They do not believe in training associates or department supervisors to do their jobs well.  They have online training (that you BETTER NOT be late taking) or you will be reprimanded.  It is a running joke within the company to 'sink or swim' and having new associates 'thrown to the wolves'.  It's not actually humorous, though, because if you sink, you WILL BE held accountable!  "
bad,Some of the associates you work with do care and is ok to work with then there  are the ones that are part time don't care. Management is very poor. The scheduling poor. Thats why i went over nites to freight team.
bad,"They want you to do high value machine work for retail sales wages. Sure, I understand, home depot needs machines to operate; so pay the machine operators better than the ones who aren't risking their career every time they sit in a forklift. "
bad,"I was nightshift so I cant speak for days but most the time your doing both shifts jobs for the minimum amount of help they give you, by the time I left we only had 4 full time overnight associates left"
bad,The management people seemed to just tell everyone what to do in a disrespectful way some where nice but some just only cared about themselves and there higher up friends
bad,"I'll never work there again. To much corporate favoritism. All other obsolete, they say they care but it doesn't show.  The hard workers get nothing. While the slacker that know management and are friends and hang out on a regular are the one that move up in the company."
bad,The lack of stability in management is just one of this companies down falls. Management in each store turns over every six months and each time the culture of the store changes. So coworkers that have been in a store for a few hears become very jaded and have little to no value for management.
bad,"A person can NOT support themselves working at Home Depot alone, even working 40 hours a week, without picking up a second job or a two income household."
bad,This is a matrix driven company that does not care for the employees.  They only care about the bottom line and how they can benefit themselves.  The people who work there give their blood and sweat and are discarded without care.
bad,"I typical Manager's work work involved working extremely long hours. The retail business is very challenging and demanding. Work life balance is not equal. The work place culture stressed taking care of the associates, but the reality is for from the company goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that are serviced and the associates that service the customer"
bad,Love the diversity and my co-workers. Get along with my managers and supervisors. Everyday is something new. Environment is fast past. Work schedule is flexable
bad,"Was not the best place to work, management is not the greatist. They will tell you it's a good place to work but it is not. They don't like you asking questions."
bad,"In my opinion this is a place you go to work while in school, or while you are looking for something better. There is lots of issues management turns a blind eye too."
bad,Helping customers with paint selection and mixing paints. I learned different ways to mix colors for people that had a specific idea of what the wanted.
bad,Your workload will consistently climb even as your energy depletes from your assigned duties. You will be tested when it comes to saying you want to work. Often times you have to manually lift heavy items (best you can) because everyone is exstremly to busy to assist.
bad,"The majority of employees in supervisor or above positions abuse authority, company policies and procedures and have no consequence. Upper management spends way too much time in meetings focusing on themselves and neglecting the associates and the sales floor."
bad,"You will start the job excited and happy. You will ignore what the others will say that things will change. Slowly with time, your spirit will be chipped away until you realize that the work you do isn't worth the sacrifice to your personal life."
bad,"Basically, at this job, you have to be friends to get hours at this company location. They enforce the rules harder for who they wish, and not everyone.You barely get hours and they don't work with another job's schedule or class schedule."
bad,"All of my co-workers were awesome, but the Management never did anything, all they did was tell people to do stuff, and if the person doesnt know how to do it, thats not management's problem"
bad,Didn't like management. There was too much favortism. A lot of workers didn't pull their own weight but never counseled. Supervisors not qualified for their positions.
bad,"its like a roller coaster never know when your off or working, have to check schedule everyday for they add hrs or take days off from you and if you don't check your schedule you can get in trouble for not showing up when you weren't scheduled in the first place."
bad,Job task included assisting customers with their purchases in the store making sure that orders were complete daily stocking of shelves cleaning and maintenance of the store making sure the customers have a great shopping experience
bad,"The Home Depot was overall an okay environment to work at. The thing about Home Depot is that they have way too many bosses that overstep their department, and some have to pick up slack for the others. At this particular store they were a bit competitive, and while I like a challenge there was way too much favoritism. I was promoted involuntarily in less than a year, and although I got a raise it was clearly not enough. The new associates ended up starting at the same rate. This place could use some improvement in the way they treat their associates. I faced obstacles that constantly came up and corporate never did anything. Don't get me wrong though its good for a temporary job, just a temporary job."
bad,Might be better for a teenager who is still in school but other then that I wouldn't advise to anyone else. There are way better jobs out there that pay more.
bad,nice place to work the downfall was the management. luch is an hour for full time and 30 minutes for part time. You move departments a lot. you learn a lot of skills since you move around so much
bad,The managers like to micro-manage everyone and they become very personal if you have a family emergency. The staff is very friendly and great workers.
bad,Work is steady. I now have good managers willing to partner with me and also consider my opinion in making decisions. New management team is fairly effective.
bad,"customer service was my amazing culture type of ,day   was great to  be  recognize all the    time everyone was always angry but i brought life goood energy and love to homedepot."
bad,N/A hard work for a women  the load do not change after coming back for FMLA they took my position and gave it to a much health person which was man and put me  to do the hard work
bad,Not a friendly workplace and doesn’t provide enough benefits allows older staff to disrespect you and don’t say anything to them or about it. Not mature enough to run a business but on the good side they pay well have entertainment like pizza party and other parties for rewards
bad,"Service bays, clean, restock, install displays and fixtures, event resets, ie: Black Friday,Christmas,  Halloween,spring garden patio furniture and other retail merchandising as needed. "
bad,"The department managers are lifers, 10 plus years with the company.  Often not educated or competent. No opportunities for advancement unless you are one of the chosen few."
bad,"It wasn't too hard to pick up how to run their cash registers, but the only thing was if you were new you would get those customers that would bring up things without barcodes and you would have to figure out what to ring them up as with some charts they had or to call someone from that specific area to come up and give you a price. Also, you would get switched to work in the garden area outside from time to time and in the summer it would get really hot.  They are really good at making sure everyone gets their scheduled breaks though."
bad,"The pay was beyond horrible there, managers didn't really care about anyone or anything, just there own back. The managers expect associates to do everything in a timely fashion and don't give any recognition or reward. Not fun to work there after a while good if it's only temporary."
bad,They talk of it about the Orange Family. But you have to be in a notch group. Training ins limited to their needs not the associate. Ask for training? Need training? Maybe get it. Or they fire you just befor the “Sucess Sharing bonus”.
bad,People were pushed to complete projects that should take 12 hours in 8 hours while making less than $10 an hour.  The people need to make more in order to meet there needs to be productive employees.
bad,"I began working here and I thought it was going to be great. I was  getting decent hours, being called in for extra shifts, and even being sent out on the floor for specialty assignments. Once I started school (which I had told them about months ahead of time, and a schedule was worked out so that I wouldn't lose hours), my hours were cut dramatically. Then my mother got ill and subsequently passed away, and they allowed me 3 days off for bereavement leave. I then returned to work and at the end of my very first shift back to work after my mother had passed they fired me for 'breaking company policy' for removing my apron from the store 3 days earlier when I told them my mother had passed. This was a horrible experience and I truly felt that I was singled out for having to take time off. I was subsequently awarded unemployment, but that didn't take away the pain I and my family went through."
bad,Watch out they write you up for illegal things. The management is ok. But they have a hard time looking for good employees because they don't value the current ones.
bad,"As an asset Protection Specialist (APS) my responsibilities include preventing financial loss caused by theft and fraud and supporting safety and environmental program compliance. As an APS I utilize several tools to minimize loss to the Company, including but not limited to identifying incidents of theft and fraud, reviewing CCTV and exception reports, monitoring the store's physical security, auditing the Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) and driving a ""shrink elimination"" culture in multiple stores internally and externally."
bad,I worked at the Lovejoy store for four and half years. I tried many times to become full time. Many of co-workers also tried to become full time but we were always turned down. The only people who ever advance at Home Depot are the people willing to kiss up or have inappropriate relations with Management and Department Heads.
bad,"Depending on the store you join, the work atmosphere will vary. Always take a walk in the store your going to choose. Look at how clean it is and how the employees are. And ask about the store manager. The people's opinion is their reality."
bad,"Not for me.  Too many chiefs, not enough indians.  Supervisors are mostly middle age women, make 10 per hour and not going any further in their jobs or life. "
bad,"Don't work here unless you want do deal with a whole lot of BS.  HD careers is a sick joke, as is advancement.  Short term, yeah, maybe.  I did 10 1/2 years for nothing. NOTHING."
bad,Managers do not acknowledge the associates who make them successful.  Communication is poor and not every employee is treated the same.  Very unfortunate.
bad,They were very lack of management and showed favoritism to employees onwhorhey liked and who they did not. Would not recommend but good hours and very flexible.
bad,"Busted My Butt for them. My asm took credit for stuff I was doing. I was terminated for not taking enough Lunches, (due to an understaffed department), & not doing My job, (because My manager was taking credit for the stuff I was doing)."
bad,"Productive work place,  management sucks but overall you can find what you need vert well in the store. Needs to work on employee friendliness alao..."
bad,"hard work and no appreciation I was their for 6 years working my tail off and never got so much as a pat on the back, some managers don't know how far a simple "" I notice you and your doing a good job"" will go for some people."
bad,"Worked at special service desk, responsible for special order and installation. Answers questions, in person or in the phone, very busy environment. I enjoyed working with our customers, and helping them out on a daily basis."
bad,"Co workers best part "
bad,"store had bedbugs on numerous occasions and would not fix the problem"
bad,Home Depot is processing out all full-timers.  The new management is looking for whatever they can find to terminate an employee. They are replacing associates with Met people who are paid by the vendors. And provide no customer assistant.
bad,Working at a distribution center for home depot means you don't mind the dirt and grime that comes with sorting Home Depot's merchandise as it comes off the truck. Worked there as a summer job.
bad,"I was laid off from NASA Johnson Space Center in October 2013, and took this job to help makes end meet.  In my opinion, management is lacking, employee numbers are low, and shifts for personnel are poorly planned.  It has not been enjoyable due to these aspects and the fact that pay is low and there is little room for advancement."
bad,"i would start the day with placing returns where they belong and help the morning contractors load their vans and trucks."
bad,"Like working for Depot and customer service!! Didn’t like the corporate business end of the business. Did not like the fact that most major decisions where made from corporate in Atlanta by people who did not know you , never met you and in a lot of cases had never been in your store . Gave you the feeling you were nothing but a number to them"
bad,Good job till I hurt my back there and they let me go 2 months later I call that wrongful termination and the new manager was just terrible. Was due for a raise and profit sharing right before they let me go how convenient. 8 years of my life there to be crapped on.
bad,Average of 65+ hours a week has resulted in a 9-month average life-span for this position. Upper management realizes there is an issue but no resolution thus far.
bad,"It can be better Managed.. I loved the MISSION statement: Giving back is a fundamental value of The Home Depot and a passion for our associate-led volunteer program, Team Depot. It great for college students"
bad,Made sure the entrance was presentable by greeting and helping costumers find what they needed. Good team work. Transferred merchandise using forklift and loading cement and gravel to costumer vehicles.
bad,"Several instances of inefficient management/rules."
bad,"At first the job was okay, I didn't mind coming in and the managers were fair and treated me well. But the problem was the supervisors and fellow associates.. A lot of sucking up and favoritism as well as talking behind the back and secret talk. Literally everyone knew everybody's business and nothing is private. Work was easy though and kept me busy just by scanning boxes and packing them out. The only problem was the people I worked with."
bad,"The company is not a good environment to work in its very negative and down grading,management is never around to back associates up when needed or called for customer assistance"
bad,"too many chiefs don't know how to run their stores.  all about themselves.  managers are allowed to make their own rules. no longer run as company. not anywhere like it was when first opened."
bad,"As an OFA, you are walking constantly from lumber to garden to receiving to the customer service desk and back again. I seem to spend 1/3 of my time just finding equipment to do my job (shrink wrap/bander/fork lift/ladder) or walking to where I can print tickets to place on my order. Nothing is centrally located, and nothing is where it should be."
bad,"for the most part you are typically used as floor coverage making it very difficult to process all of the paperwork they require.  Reduced tags, clearance report, if your department requires you to order merchandise, initiating seasonal resets for the met team, setting ads, general department maintenance, receiving and stocking merchandise, setting map, pulling customer orders, managing your associate's time, staff meetings. Since they only pay new associates $10 it makes it very difficult to maintain your staff typically after you spend a bunch of time training them and they leave after finding other better paying jobs."
bad,"Pay is lower than retail competitors. It looks good on paper if you max out the voluntary benefits, however, to do that you are saving 27% of your income in the retirement plans and living off of around 8 bucks an hour minus taxes."
bad,"Working at the Store Support Center is great.  Working in product Support not so much. Product Support people are expendable, but others (programmers) are treated very well."
bad,"working at home depot was a fast pasting environment. some days are more challenging than others but overall okay. what i've learned working at home depot is always try to make the customers visit as pleasant as possible, be polite and welcoming."
bad,"On a typical day one sales associate will help customers find what they are looking for and if they cant find it in store they will look online to complete the sale. The hardest part of the job is there is never enough associates to help all the customers, sometime customers will leave mad and frustrated. I have learned a lot about the different types of flooring there are, Helping customers choose the flooring for there needs and getting it for them at the lowest possible cost is the best part of the job."
bad,This company wants to thrive off teamwork and collaborate efforts to make customers happy but it is not a smooth process. Advancement does not occur for the hard-workers.
bad,"Extremely poor communication in the building which includes; the supervisors do not know how to do the jobs that the employees they are responsible for are doing, certain supervisors wants employees to do manager roles, changes departments are made from managers in other departments and are not told to the employees that are working in those departments. Very little information is given to the employees by the supervisors. Most of the information is supplied by rumors."
bad,Routinely short-staffed.  MODs are inexperienced and ineffective. Typical department workload is 8 customers to one associate. The entire operation is poorly managed and delivers zero feedback to worker issues. Full time work is rare.
bad,"Company is too cheap re: staffing, infrastructure.  HIGH stress level.  Schedules and pay levels do not match up.  I liked the people I worked with.  I  liked one of the managers, but the rest were hard to work for."
bad,Don't really have the support from management when it comes to advancing in your career. It is a good place to gain skills and product knowledge. The pay is fair for incoming associates but not for those who have been working there for years.
bad,"A lot of physical labor, Pay is based on incentive. But not fairly given to the people who do the work. Numbers are divided among favorites. A good place to get hours if you are quickly trying to find another job."
bad,My time a Depot was good for the 1st 8'years was enjoyable and had a bright future. New manager came in and changed culture to negative and cut throat. He was untruthful and disrespectful.
bad,"Return department had customers sometimes standing around the corner to get assistance. Sometimes I felt like a robot, I enjoyed meeting new people and helping others, I felt that people lack in moral and can be very rude. I just had to smile."
bad,"you wont make much. they often reduced staff to keep payroll down. Not a bad job, pretty low stress, but its nearly minimum wage, and overtime is pretty much never an option. its a 30 hours a week or less job, fulltime doesnt exist."
bad,"Good Co-workers, Management and GWA's have a staggering turnover rate. Would be a good job if not for utter lack of communication between all parties involved. Starter job only, far from a career to retire at. Pay increases are laughable along with options to advance within the company."
bad,I have nothing to say about this job or any of the employes who where there at the time of this job. I am biased about everything. The end and peace out.
bad,"As long as current management is in place I would never work at this location again."
bad,Home depot is a great company for students or the retired looking for part time work . full time positions and hours are sporatic at best making it uncomfortable to have a system or pattern for employment
bad,"Tout a job culture of taking care of their employees, but really can't wait to drag people in the office to write them up for every little thing so the employee can be fired for seemingly no reason. Definitely have to watch your back."
bad,"As a cashier your'e required to stand in 1 spot ALL day, boring, coworkers gossip nonstop, will approve your limited availability but still schedule when you can't work, enjoyed the customers, management is only in it for themselves & anytime you come to them with a concern they do not address it."
bad,The more you learn the more they want you to do without compensation. Favoritism to the lazy is prevalent.  If you work hard and help other associates you get very little in return.
bad,sink or swim when it comes to home depot they put you in depts. with little to no knowledge as well as have you do back breaking task without a thank you or keep up the good work. Management tears you down does not up lift you at all.
bad,"The main store manager at this location is horrible, he doesn't have his associates back. It's like every worker for themselves. The people there are great people to work with"
bad,"I was employed as a part time cashier and I would only recommend working for Home Depot to someone who may be still in school or just needs a little extra cash.  In my opinion if you have not been working for Home Depot for at least 20+ years or come work for the company on a corporate/managerial level, you will not be able to make a decent living working for this company.  I was grateful for the time I was employed there but I never intended to be there long term."
bad,"Management changes often ."
bad,"They have good benefits, and training is okay. The pay is competitive. They stress customer service and product knowledge.  There is room for advancement.  The hardest part of the job would be the lifting and the dirt and dust, also the heat. The management has a lot to be desired. They discriminate on age."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Stressful, micro managed environmemt. Always looking over your shoulder, Pay is rerrible and rev iews are insulting, Enough said,"
bad,"MEA (Merchandise Execution Associate)  Low Starting Pay with annual raises of $.02 - .25 an hour!  No opportunity for advancement unless you want to work overnight.  To transfer to store side you must be favored since the management team cherry picks whom they transfer.  Store side predominantly hires part time so they don't have to pay for benefits.  They can and do cut your hours down to even 4 hours a week!  The schedule is posted 2-3 weeks at a time and they have you come in and close one night then open the next day at 4:00 am!  Cut throat, blatant favoritism and jaded management personnel that couldn't care less.  No employee discounts."
bad,There was never a day that I left with the satisfaction of knowing I got everything done I needed to for the day. Over time was not allowed but there was no way to complete all the tasks needed to be completed. Most support staff was not trained well enough to successfully execute their job. There was little consistency and nepotism  ran rampant!
bad,I didn't like it. Everyone wasn't made to work. If you were friends with a supervisor you get to walk around all day. All supervisors would watch you not just your own. It was hard working under stressful conditions
bad,"Then they started finding fault with everything I did. Including how I answered the phone. Nothing I did was good enough and I was getting more and more stressed out so I didn't want to go in to work."
bad,"The entire place was nothing but favortism between everyone. They kept messing up everyones linches and breaks. There werent enough cashiers during rushes, Mostly just two at a time one inside and ine out in garden"
bad,the power of the employees needs to be greater and my salary was not increased after the minimum went up so im making less than the minimum. also the some of the managers really miss treat you and well make me feel like im going to get fired every time they call me.
bad,Home Depot started out a very good company to work for . There was laughter and smiles on the employees faces each day. then management changed and all the good times were going.
bad,"The company is a big mess, the district managers never seem to be satisfied with any store, and the pay is horrible. Usually you might end covering 3 shifts in a day."
bad,I've said enough I'm not impressed with the work ethics of Home Depot.  Management has no support of the Associated that give 100% plus. But will give Homer awards to Kids that have worked there a year.  Just Silly Stuff
bad,It is very hard to break into management. They punish people that do not have open availability and will cut their hours down to nothing. If you are a cashier...all management cares about is obtaining credit from customers despite the fact that many Home Depot customers already have cards.
bad,"When i first started to work at Home Depot, it was good. Things were going smooth and it wasn't too bad, of course, i was really in need of a job and plus i just started, so i didn't really know how Home Depot was or what was about to come. After a couple of months working at Home Depot, i became tired and frustrated with it. I don't feel safe, there is not security available at the job and i wasn't getting acknowledge much for all my hard work and effort at the job. I was being overworked and taking advantage of and not getting any recognition for my dedication and effort. I also witness my coworkers go through the same thing, not getting acknowledge either at all or barely for the hard work they do and what's sad is that some have kid(s) and don't get much time or time at all to spend with them because they are giving majority of their time to Home Depot to satisfy and accomodate to the needs of Home Depot. I left Home Depot because i was tired of what i had to go through and i wasn't too happy about the workplace at all and i feel that the store i worked at needs big improvement."
bad,"Benefits extremely expensive more than a 3rd of your pay.  Management is unorganized and uncaring.  No clear path to promotion however, they will tell you that it is all about attitude however, you can have the greatest attitude and still not move up."
bad,"If you are a high performer, who thrives in an environment of mutual respect and equality then this is not the company for you"
bad,"While the associates are great people, the management doesn't seem to care about the associates. ""If I fired everyone here I could have 50 new people in here tomorrow."""
bad,I would not work for the retail but corporate and distribution I would recommend to a friend. Customers are pleasant and associates are friendly but its not a dream job.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the days was anytime the manager was on vacation. Because the Assistant Store Managers would not be running around trying to change the store appearance for the mood the manager was in that day.  They could do there jobs!"
bad,They hire in too many people and say it is not temp. Then they drastically cut hours until people leave. A real shady way to start off with employees who really need to work and think they are going to be getting hours. Long time employees feel threatened by the new folks and the stories start to flow. Mgmt can't keep their practices under wraps past the first week or so of a new employees time. All is spilled by the long timers.
bad,The store I worked in had a demanding and difficult store manager who was nice sometimes and was upset easily over minor things.  There was high turnover and employees were unhappy and on pins and needles.
bad,"The job has great people and feels like a family, however higher up make it stressful at times with cut backs. "
bad,"As a Merchandising Execution Associate (MEA) you are timed in everything do. Little or no rewards in a job well done, in fact you will be given criticism of what you don't do righ more often than not."
bad,"It's easy work but there is no way to move up. The management is not good. The benefits are expensive. the pay sucks. They don't give you pay raises on time. the reviews are just an excuse not to pay you more,"
bad,Management there lets certain people get away with things and if  your not in their little click then u will be punished for every little thing. Too much favoritism
bad,"This position can be rewarding only if you catch shoplifters. If you can't, then this isn't for you. With the right manager this position can be fun. Wrong manager and you won't last a year"
bad,management plays a big roll in how you like working for a company. When I first started working at home depot I loved it. Great people fun environment . After about 6 months they changed management team and I hated it. They were less likely to adhere to your scheduling needs  and often treated you like you were replaceable
bad,"Excellent co workers, poor career advising and opportunities for Associates. Poor salary increases. Company lacks communication between associates and management. Lacks concern for employees."
bad,"Same type of culture as the other retail giants. They may pay you ok, they might treat you ok if you like the same football team as your  boss. Not a secure place to work."
bad,This is a place where you could be one of the top producers and still told your performance needs to improve or you will be written up. Discussing issues with the GM will yield you nothing. No one there is willing to look at the changes that have been made and come up with solutions to problems created by the changes. They certainly will not listen to employee recommendations.
bad,"Working here is almost similar to working a high school job. The company politics and favoritism play a major factor in anything at this company. That includes promotions, training opportunities, and special requests (such as schedule needs for school)."
bad,"Very little opportunity for advancement, Management does not acknowledge hard working employees. Overall low morale of employees. Somewhat physical job."
bad,"Managers need better training to deal with employees, in an empathetic way."
bad,"They play favorites, dont work around your schedule, don't have enough people on staff, constantly fire people. This is a seasonal job it works well as a temporary part time fix but good luck getting full time. Full time employment requires an open schedule which means you will be working weekends and holidays they are open every day of the year but two Christmas and thanksgiving. The current CEO is attempting to reduce costs and increase profits by lowering compensation. Pay rates start at 10 dollars a hour and pay raise are yearly and range from about 10 cents hour to 50 cents an hour most employees will make about 15 cent raise."
bad,"Typical day of work consisted with loading customers vehicles and clearing lot of debris and carts.  I learned a decent amount about home and lawn care.  Upper management were decent folk, but supervisors weren't very friendly or helpful.  Hardest part of the job was the physically demanding efforts.  The most enjoyable was the freedom of being outdoors mostly."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot for the most part. They were always smiling and helping the costumer was and is their main focus. Unfortunately, their wages are just above minimum wage and they dont offer additional hours or pay increases regardless of time spent with the company. They hire more and more people, while their seasoned workers are offered no additional hours and struggle to keep the job"
bad,unless your into contractor stuff i dont believe you would like it. it was very demanding and the managers are very disrespectful. they treat you like children
bad,"Learned a lot but management is a joke, and the work place environment is a joke. You're basically a joke, like your salary there. Overall unpleasant but you gotta grind"
bad,"Home Depot wants you to work as if you were being paid $100 per hour for $ 9 per hour. Never let you have time off for any holidays, its always ""blacked out""."
bad,Unless you are related to the people higher up in the company you are ignored and left on your own to deal with things. The management was spotty if noticeable at all.
bad,Retail is probably the worst jobs to apply for. The customers will give you headaches and your coworkers are your therapist that have to suffer along with you. Avoid retail unless you're desperate.
bad,"Pay is low, management disengaged.  Hard to move up unless you know someone.  Did learn a lot while I was there though most was on computers as apposed to hands on training."
bad,"Being a cashier was difficult because when a customer did not receive help from other associates, they take it out on you in the front of the store. I would never be a cashier for The Home Depot in Greeley again."
bad,The people are great to work with.  We give support to all of our team and feel like Family because we are in the trenches together.
bad,"Demanding job for minimum wage. Customers expect advice on tool specifications and operation, materials required for project applications.  Work schedule is part time and random changing every week. Sometime closing the store and opening the next day. Management doesn't seem to value experience or performance for advancement. I've been passed over twice, hiring younger inexperienced people instead. Workplace culture is very team oriented, with rally type events with paper awards and pins but salary increases are tied to time at the company. Some free lunches on holidays workdays. The hardest part is stocking with heavy merchandise, and responding to management demands that varies according to each manager's preference. Most enjoyable is helping customers with their project issues and needs."
bad,"fun place to work, fast placed The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."
bad,Well honestly some employee is decided to resign not because of the job. It's because of the management they don't know how to treat well there employee.
bad,The Home Depot Is An OK Work place but the down fall about it is unfair employment opportunity. Management Ain't That Great and Department Heads Are Worthless because Store managers let them slack and get away with allot of stuff along with to much favoritism going on.If your looking to work for the company don't expect much on moving up.
bad,customer relations sales inventory stocking shelves helping customers to find what they need try to up sell helping other departments with there needs
bad,"All associates that work at the home depot are friendly and caring. Working there has given me many opportunities and has opened me up to talk to more customers with out being shy. I learned a lot working there, i have worked in many departments and have experienced different type of work and have worked with many people throughout my time in the company"
bad,"I was the only Exterior Sales Rep for 4 stores and they ran my wheels off.  Around 80% of the leads came from the internet, really frustrating they were not asked a few basic questions before handed to me."
bad,"Typical day would consist of:"
bad,"You are under paid and over worked. It doesn't matter how hard you work for the company and customers, if a manager doesn't like you , your days are numbered. They have a high turn over because they will fire you just because they don't like you, not because you're a poor employee."
bad,"the full time people dont have a set hours they are flexible. you can work morning and afternoon, and nights. not much help for the cashiers from the employees on the floor with price checks"
bad,Management is very clique like and not willing to work with you to improve your performance for advancement. There was a  lack of recognition.  The hardest part of the position was when there was not enough staff on hand to help with the customers with each department and on a register.
bad,I was with the company for over 10 years and was let go for making a better business decision that saved the company from a multi million dollar law suit
bad,"There are many opportunities to learn new skills, but management at the store level can hinder your progress greatly, even if you are well qualified for a supervisor position.  This is a good job to have while in college, but I would not make this a career, unless you absolutely love this area of business.  "
bad,management does not know what they are doing and plays favorites with people that they like. and try to find ways to fire people they do not like need to train people better
bad,Listening to customers' needs and trying to satisfy their needs by getting them what they were looking for or probing them further and getting them something very close to what they had in their minds
bad,"Long hours 10 hour shifts, GWAs have to work standing all day - so much so for health and safety. Turnover is high - all the good people leave. Co-workers are a mixture of well-mannered people as well as rowdy. Work would be more enjoyable if you did not have to put up with standing all day!!"
bad,"Moving up is really easy. Its just a matter of time. You can pretty much guarantee a move up if you stay there long enough. The job is really easy and the people you work with are extremely great kinds of people. But going through being cussed out and sometimes in physical danger from customers' unreasonable attacks, the pay isn't really worth it. But the friends I made and still have made the 3 years I spent there almost a great time."
bad,"The work schedules would change regularly "
bad,"Home Depot use to be a fun place to work for. We use to get merrit raises and had all kinds of incentive programs. Now it seems like they are trimming the fat and tacking on more work, but wages aren't improving for those that remain. The quality of managers that are hired are a joke."
bad,"This is a position that I took as I was told that I could work my schedule around my schooling. It provided a meager income and gave me something to do on days that I wasn't attending college."
bad,"Admittedly, this was a ""make-do"" job for me; I was a greeter."
bad,"Nobody wants to work in a situation where hours can't be guaranteed, and bosses give promotions to buddies, rather than the most qualified candidates. I witnessed many people quitting there jobs, because of favoritism."
bad,"Supervisors do not care. They're just there to fund their hobbies outside of work don't do much but walk around and chit chat. GWA's work hard day in and day out. High turnover, nobody wants to work there and people are constantly being fired because of productivity numbers which are poorly in place and work against you. they are always hiring because no one wants to work there after a few months. Very stressful and constant changes by people who don't do the work. If you have to work there make it temporary and exit before they find a reason to let you go because of their poor management and poorly thought out changes."
bad,great team work just not good enough pay work weekends even when i got promoted not good enough pay for retail u have to work holidays.
bad,"clean department, down stock, help customers, put away returns, organize overhead storage, stock end caps, replace worn out price tags"
bad,The home depot said they hired me but gave me a really bad job that I hate. I wanted a regular customer service job that is safe and it is not. They said if I am interested in the job and I said no. The Home Depot gives you a bad position just so you cannot be hired.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"I worked for home depot for approximately 4 years. They offer benefits to both part-time and full-time employees which is nice. The wage and hours are pretty on par with any other ""big box"" company."
bad,"MET associates are not Home Depot store associates, MET associates are merchandisers that help out with the appearance of displays and aisles. "
bad,Very unsafe work environment. People get hurt a lot and not reported. Management is very partial to one another. Some sleeping around and just bad practices. Not a great store that I was at.
bad,"I learned a lot there, but it is not something I would do again. Associates are overworked and receive no back up from management. Department Managers are held accountable for things that they have no power over."
bad,We would go to a different store everyday to check displays and either fix or order new displays.  The managment staff I did not like nor get along with and the pay was below average
bad,"had a great supervisor,loved working outside with flowers in the summer,enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for"
bad,"Management was a joke at this store they are incompetent they're definitely way below their pay grade. The store manager, assistant manager, specialty manager and especially the operations manager were very discouraging unless you are a suck up to them there was no chance of getting anywhere in this store. Since this store is isolated to the lake of the ozarks area the majority of the workers get along well but they don't take outsiders in very well. They take pride in working so slow they say it's the lake everything is relaxed this is the management and employees they don't appreciate a fast paced and knowledgable  employees. If you ever brought up that things could move faster and people could be more productive the mangers would get offended and always said that they knew who was slacking which happened to be most of the department supervisors but they never did anything about it because they were buddies and employees who brought this up were told they were too ""opinionated"" quote the store manager words. Some of the management also hangs out with hourly employees which by Home Depot rules is major violation but since they're way out of the metropolitan areas nobody higher up in the company knows about it. All the promotions that were given to other employees that were under qualified for the positions they got was only because they were friends with the managers at that store. I thought I could make a career at Home Depot but this store ruined the experience for me. Now I'm glad I'm no longer there because there are a lot better opportunities out there."
bad,"The Management in this Home Depot has become very difficult to work for. Anytime there was an employee discrepancy, they would not deal with it. They would send all  discrepancies to the Corporate Office. These people decide whats the best solution to the problem, with out know you or what really happened. To me this is not right and it is not fair."
bad,"This would be a great place to work if you were given any value at all by the company. This company should really feel ashamed. They try to use subliminal techniques to make you believe you are valued and treated fairly while paying you the lowest salary the can get by with. Nobody can live on this money while the top company people make millions and millions. They should be ashamed. Its really really sad. Its scary also after you get out and look back at the way they try to trick you constantly into believing you are treated well. They use constant video and manager stimulation. Even on breaks they have a constant video playing telling you how great the Home Depot is treating its employees. Constant computer training telling you that the Home Depot treats its employees so well and there is no need for any union talk. Constant praise from managers and maybe an occasional minimal raise. Really, I loved working here. The people are great people and the place is fun to work at but it is only a viable option if you are retired and already have enough money and just want something to do. The Home Depot should be ashamed, but they wont be, they will be laughing around their private golf courses and boat clubs while you starve working here."
bad,"Vary Tremendously "
bad,"Job was fun, co-workers were ok. Did not receive enough hours. Management was unprofessional and did not communicate will with employees."
bad,"The pay rate is bad at this company for lower level management.  People in my position are way under payed for the work we do, and there is no set pay scale-if management likes you, you get paid more, not by virtue of working harder or being more qualified for the position, but by how much you ""suck up"".  I was making only a dollar an hour more than those I was supervising, and sometimes making a lot less than those that had been in the company a long time.  There is no room for advancement unless you get on the good side of management even though your education and experience might be excellent for advancing.  When positions would open up, they might interview people for appearances of being fair, but they already would know in advance who they were going to put in that position.  The company stated that the opportunities for advancement were outstanding and unlimited as long as you worked hard, but that is a lie in my experience with the company.  "
bad,"I was a loyal employee was there for three years,an only getting 29 hours a week when new people would come in at 40.Didn't care for the manager at all.an only got one promotion in 3 years,an i was good at my job."
bad,"-Merchandise basic duties of introducing new product, filling shelves, spruced up for the customer ease of finding what the need."
bad,"Full time hours,no benefits.Have you work full time and keep you on the books as part time so they do not have to give you benefits!~"
bad,"poor leadership, they use intimidation to put fear in workers. Finding the right person for your business is a crucial decision that hinges on the way you search for, select and interview potential applicants."
bad,Sales jobs no individual bonus programs available. Sales matrix varied. Training  mostly computer driven very little hands on training. Low pay and poor scheduling.
bad,Fun place to work for the most part. I learned allot while I was in the hardware department.. The workers were the main reason most people stayed as long as they did. Turnover was rampant. constantly changing. supervisors were reassigned different departments with little or no training then fired for not making quotas. If you weren't  a department supervisor you were nothing.
bad,Good as a first job for young adults.  No rewards for good work.  Lots of negative feed back on work done. Lots of management turn over and moving them around.
bad,The pay was low. Management slashed hours and hired new people instead of employing the people they have. Moral was low. Some people at some stores are very caddy and play Favoritism.
bad,"Made a few good friends. But employment wise, the salary is terrible and expectations high for the money paid.. No full time positions. Benefits are not all that great.  It seems in my experience, there is not a whole lot of support for associates from management."
bad,"This place is a very family type work place. The one thing wrong here is the management. in my situation I was micro managed and any little thing I did, I was spoken to. It was really bad. They will not make you full time, no matter how good of an employee you are. Simply awful, it you get sick and you have no medical coverage at all."
bad,"ok seasonal job"
bad,"The fundamentals of the company are great but the problem is there's alot of personal influences within the company. I've seen great associates lose their jobs due to no communication or personal issues within the management team. Your raise is based on the opinion of your supervisors. so if your not on good terms with your manager, your review (what determines how much of a raise your receive) is not gonna look good."
bad,"Hired for sales position in the Millworks. Expected to lift heavy items, get paid about $10/ hour, and work in under staffed situations.  Most people working there have physical injuries. People are over worked, under paid in a noisy, dusty, and unprofessional environment. Extensive on line training does not help with the over complicated software being used on the sales floor. Unless you are desperate, work elsewhere."
bad,"Management is all about singing their own praises. They do not care about the employees, only make their success share. Success share is almost nothing unless you are management. There is no interest in helping employees when they encounter problems. (Even long term employees do not matter. Full time position are nearly impossible to obtain."
bad,"Not enough staff, management not supportive, a lot of favoritism. the pay is ok if you have been with company for over 20 years."
bad,"This job is a great job as a part time gig, or for a young kid. would never make a career out of this job. but i had fun and met some great people during my time there."
bad,It good to get your foot in the door. Stable company with a long term goals. I would recommend this company if you can get a solid position.
bad,a lot of staff on hand.  Opportunity to learn a lot of do it yourself jobs for the home and self tutorials. meet and network with contractors and 3rd parties to help with at home projects
bad,"Although, working at The Home Depot had it's moments, the con's out grew the pro's. Management was poor to direct any direction among team and worked employees long and hard hours without allowing breaks some times. There was employee funds for those who were in need, but in the time I had worked their, the company falsified the funds three out of four times to employees who were just taking advantage of the extra money. Awards were given to those who were in favoritism of the managers, and many employees were left unrecognized of their hard work. On top of favoritism, those who were stealing from the company were left to go by unnoticed for a significant time until district management was involved."
bad,"Great Co Workers horrible management and real bad shifts. Managers are too concerned with themselves and never take time to give positive feedback. Shifts are all over the map. 1 day you are 3-midnight and the next day you are 5am-2pm then a 9-6. Zero consistency unless you are the managers ""Golden Child"", then you get whatever you want."
bad,"As a result of cutting part-timers, and not hiring full timers, it was extremely stressful trying to juggle customer service and department maintenance while keeping on top of learning new product. I left because it was too much to handle, and was not worth the stress."
bad,I have great co-workers but management isn't that great. They take advantage of the employees. The more you know the more they expect and they don't compensate for it. They rarely even acknowledge your presence. Not a very fair job. There is favoritism at my location and it shows in the work load.
bad,"They promote people with less qualifications that others. Hard work is not recognized, People are promoted with very little experience."
bad,hours would change on the drop of a dime and management would not notify you of the change until they are writing you up  for being three hours late.
bad,"my work is Monday through Friday 5:00 am to 2:00pm. I learned more about our inventory system and how it works, including ordering and managing orders. Management at this store is really not up to par, our managers don't give clear orders and don't explain why an individual doesn't get promoted and what they need to work on to get promoted. my co-workers are fun and we have a good time, getting along with the managers, having the weekends off"
bad,"The routine is the same daily. Fast pace and deadlines need to be met, not enough training, most was learned on the job. You have to assist customers the best you can with little training in other departments, it was not always easy finding a department associate to assist with customer service."
bad,"Work steady from the time you clock in until you go home, some times you get breaks, but not always. "
bad,"a good day at work come in help cashiers with any problems being presented, help out customers."
bad,I  would help customers find what they needed in the store and try to sell credit cards to the customers that walk into the store.
bad,"There was hardly any hours given. "
bad,"Home Depot has a history of helping others in need.  Well it is true unless you are right there working for them. Management has the POWER TO LIE to you and get away with it, HR can choose WHO get's hours and who don't.  Homer Fund is an excellent benefit if needed but few ask to use it."
bad,I work as a cashier permanent garden. I like work in that area of the store. I especially like doing excellent customer service.Also I know the department well.
bad,"The typical day started with reviewing daily appointments prepping paperwork, printing property description sheets updating computer system with correct spelling and grammar in computer systems."
bad,"I worked at HDE for nearly two years. At the beginning of my employment the job was good, the hours reasonable. I had a branch project coordinator that was my right hand and kept things on track. Management then decided to outsource the project coordination to a centralized Operations Center in Atlanta. Without adequate testing before implementation. The evidence of failure of their outsourcing came immediately.Customers who used to have contact with one PC now had to have contact with whoever happened to answer their call. VOC started to suffer. Scheduling, which used to be accomplished with efficiency on a 4' x 8"" white board by a PC by direct contact with an installer, now was done through ETA Direct scheduling software by Operation Agents. ISM's and Installers lamented the loss of their PC's since the outsourcing was a failure that they had to sweep up after. We were told by Management to ""look through the windshield instead of the rear view mirror"". "
bad,"I really enjoy working with people, so much so that I gained my own personal group of clients that request me. I love learning, fact checking, and stretching around to know more about other departments in the store. I like helping my co-workers and being aware of where the day should be headed (i.e: Schedules, lunch breaks, etc..). "
bad,"Home Depot offers fair wages, but the scheduled work hours are all over the board, leaving hardly any person time flexibility.  Also, it can"
bad,Left my previous job to work here only to be laid off after a year because they relocated to GA. They did not offer to increase pay if relocated.
bad,"When I started in Cleveland is was all good! Great team and room to grow... with understanding."
bad,Some teams lack the supervisors that develop their staff.  Diverse environment.  Management makes efforts to make going to work something to look forward to.
bad,"I work for the Merchandise Execution Team, and the job itself involves maintaining, cleaning, and organizing displays and product.  The job itself is simple, but often relies too heavily on cryptic acronyms and standard operating procedures.  This often results in new-hires feeling overwhelmed and overworked, as they are expected to catch up with 10+ years of information in the course of a month.  There is little opportunity for advancement through this particular job, as many of the people in supervisor and manager positions have held their jobs for years.  Overall, this is a great job for someone looking for set hours in a retail environment, with lower than average pay.  If you are looking for advancement in this particular career at Home Depot, steer clear, an opportunity may never arise."
bad,Low wage with no night differential. Inefficient SOPs with very little value placed on associate input or workload. High turnover due to conflict between upper and middle management. Good benefits. Store culture trends towards lack of accountability and finger pointing which leads to apathy among the employees and frustration by the customers
bad,"work maximum hours, litter respect, treated poorly, no communication or connection with anyone especially management. favoritism shown in employees. watch you back everyone is always after each other to promote themselves. no advancement unless you degrade coworkers"
bad,"A good job for someone who needs a flexible schedule with different hours each day; 8 - 5, 1 - 10, 3- 12 all in the same week."
bad,Assisting customers with their needs. Receiving and unloading trucks
bad,"The HD has a bad habit of terminating long term Associates and Managers just before they are fully vested. They often ""clean house"" of good Associates and badly reviewed Associates alike."
bad,"My day consisted of repairing broken machinery and demonstrating the safe and proper procedures on how to operate tools."
bad,Poor communication from management team to associate level.  Didn't care about health and welfare of supporting cast.
bad,"Begin job in a part time position and became full-time associate within three months. As an associate days are filled with typical retail tasks.....placing freight, downstocking, customer service.....promoted to department manager within 8 months of hire date. However, advancement from that point on was all but impossible unless you are willing to play politics you will NOT advance.....The current salaried management team at this location with the exception of one assistant manager is absolutely pathetic. Merchandising assistant manager is intent on chasing pretty young women all day long. The store manager plays favorites and has no merchandising skills and consistently argues with her management team and as a result department managers and associates are constantly rearranging and resetting because the management team cannot agree. As a result most associates are discontented and the morale in the store is low!!!!! I CANNOT recommend working at this Home Depot!"
bad,great customers. fun to talk while checking them out i still got them through check out faster than most and held a good conversation. had many repeat customers. some of my coworkers slacked off so much that they asked me to help out and do their jobs. such as push carts. my bos told me i was to go nowhere without his say so. he was one of four ASM managers. he kept me in lumber and took me off applicant list for advancement. the other three managers recommended me for the job and didn't know he took me off the list. he told me after the job was taken i wasn't ready for it and he didn't give me permission to leave his department. i wanted to kill him after that but i reported him and put in my two weeks notice.
bad,"Not all stores are the same, but where I came from there were many challenges.  Most troubling circumstances breeded from child-like drama among staff.  Rumors, jealousy, false accusations and blame were a daily occurrence.  Managment was out to get  anyone who was in their way, most notably- a spicific person whom had been there for about 20 years was fired over something very trivial and a first time offender.  He brought into the company a minimum average of about $30,000 a day through excellant service and interpersonal skills. He wasn't the only one whom fell into the same patern of terminations and unjust write ups.  There's a business to be ran, to grow, and petty things such as this hurt the client relationship, relations."
bad,Didn't like that they are not wanting to keep people full time. Transfers to another store is pretty easy but keeping your full time status will go away
bad,Schedule fluctuation were unacceptable.  Worked anywhere from 8 hours to 30 hours per week.  Schedule changes made without notice.  Unable to maintain a household budget due to never knowing future schedule.
bad,"The expectations of this job were challenging, in the fact that it was an all or nothing job. You either sold the product and made a commission or did not sell and made nothing."
bad,"dirty environment, low pay and disregard for employees personal situations"
bad,Performed a variety of duties involved in the operation of a central switchboard; to provide information to customers and employees; and to perform a variety of clerical tasks relative to the assigned area of responsibility. I learned to work with many different personalities of management and co-workers.
bad,different customers everday. Not enough hours. Management sends you home and/or cuts hours.
bad,Ostigamiento laboral discriminacion por puestos preferencias
bad,"I worked overnight freight, we worked so hard every night, and got ZERO recognition, and got paid the worst of anyone in the store. management was terrible only cared about their own paychecks, they didn't care about the employees, dental and vision benefits are good. raises are an absolute joke at most maybe 30 cents a year. advancement is unlikely considering all the employees that make all the money and do ZERO work are the ones with 15 plus years experience. This was a fun place to work for about a month, then you realize how terrible this company is to work for."
bad,"Don't work too hard for Home Depot, you will find that they take advantage of it without any more compensation or advancement available.  The employees are congenial and the atmosphere seems welcoming until you work there for at least 90 days."
bad,There is always lots of work to do as a cashier at home depot just pray you don take up this job in the summer like I did. I worked in the garden where it was hot and the outside fan didn't work. Ofcourse this is the time when everyone wants to shop in the garden as well.
bad,"As a part-time associate at the home depot a typical day is straightening products in every hardware isle and maintaining clean isles. Keeping our return cart empty, making sure shelves are fully stocked.The challenge of being a hardware associate is explaining the experience or expertise behind products or tools to customers. I learned to listen and ask questions from those who were experienced customers,( i.e. construction/carpenter worker) and my head leader I worked under. I'd say, that, what  was the most difficult part of my job- was having to answer unexpected questions or give explanations and/or giving suggestions on what to use in place of something else. Their are two types of customers at the Home Depot; the pro customer and the non-pro customer. My co-workers were majority of the time a great team to work with, while at other times depending on who I worked with, and what shift, were lazy and ran away from customer service. Management was not as stern as they could be (most) and to many people working together that knew each other personally, and were related to each other. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customer service, helping different people I meet. The most fun customers I come into contact with is the customer who learns with me about their project they're shopping for that day, a fun encounter."
bad,"Did not respect personal needs, such as (doctor appointed) sitting for pain control. Management was very selfish and could care less if you had an emergency. "
bad,Working in the South is very different then the Silicon Valley.  The pace is much slower and this work differently in Atlanta.
bad,The typical work day consists of driving an order picker to down stock items from the overhead and selling appliances to customers and helping the customers in any way possible. I have learned that working with people in retail can be great or one of the worse experiences you can have throughout the day. Management is extremely fragile and rotates way to often. Also younger managers exhibit the need for power and often treat employees like children and talk down to them even though everyone employed there is an adult. For the most part 90% of the people that work there are awesome but the others should have never made it through the interview. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects very often every day and asking small things out of managers and them not being able to come through with anything. The part of the job i enjoy the most is helping customers who are appreciative of the help. Also meeting and being friends with the 90% of people who are awesome is a great part of it.
bad,"Long hours of standing/still"
bad,This was a temp job  that taught me a lot about the building industry
bad,"Constant change in management, wasn't condusive to keeping staff. Very focused on bottom line not staffing and keeping competent people. Was dissappointing after working at the Red Deer store."
bad,Overall I felt like I worked really hard and did not have full recognition for the work I did for them. I was able to move up very quickly and once I moved up my manager did not recognize fully all the work i did.  I think that this is a good company overall but some locations have managers that could use some help in becoming better managers.  Overall I think think this was a good experience for me and it helped be determine what I want and don't want within an employer.
bad,worker with my co workers made the job fun. If it wasn't for the good people and friends i made it would have been hell management doesn't care about your family life all they care is about making a dollar.
bad,"Working at The Home Depot was always an experience because of the many different customers you encounter in one work shift. As a Garden Associate, it was on me to be well versed in the products my department carried, and the knowledge that I gained stuck with me even while not currently employed there. The managers were tough and made sure the quota was met, however, while the other co-workers slacked off, their workload was almost certainly tacked on to your own. It's a position that definitely had it's ups and downs, not to mention the strain walking on concrete for several hours a day can have on your body. At the end of it all, knowing that I genuinely helped the customers find what meets their needs as opposed to just making a sale, would be a highlight to it all. I've had customers come back, unhappy because other employees have sold them what they didn't really need, and being able to solve their problem while still maintaining the customer's trust in the company's effectiveness is enjoyable. I mean, when customers come in and look for you specifically by name because you've given them excellent customer service, speaks volumes about the type of employee I am."
bad,working for family is never a good thing because they thought they didn't have to pay me as much as other apprentice electricians
bad,"Simply put if you want to advance in this company, its who you have lunch with that matters most and not work ethic."
bad,All of my comments for The Home Depot will be derogatory so at this time I would rather not comment.
bad,"A typical work day is hectic and unorganized. Management spends more time in meetings then on the floor. Co-workers are good unless your one of the ""favorites"" or a veteran with the company, then you can get away with pretty much anything you want."
bad,Working in a retail field related to hardware/home improvement allows a person to develop their interpersonal skills through assisting customers in finding products they desire as well as informing them of the qualities of products that they are interested in.
bad,"Business as usual, no change at all. "
bad,"Basic philosophy and core principles are excellent, but management strays far away from these and gets to borderline of the intent.  Company has many good employees."
bad,Management was non existent. OK pay but the hours and amount of work you have to do they pay people on other shifts much better for a quarter of the work.
bad,Poor comunication on part of management. Not good training.
bad,"When I first started working at the home depot, things where fine, I loved my job. Then a walk through was bad and inventory was off majorly. All three Assistant Managers changed within a couple months, and new assistant managers were brought in. They claimed it was employee issued and went on a firing spree, bring in a total NEW group of employees. Didn't help matters at all because the level of customer service drop according to the VOC score though out the store. They are extremely pushy on credit and pick favorites. Let those particular people get away with what ever (pick their own schedules, calling in all the time without getting in trouble for it, taking 2 hours lunches, not covering their dept., not answering phones, etc, etc) However those that do their jobs get fired or wrote up for the same things. Management is a problem and treat the valued employees unfairly. If you complain to them, they blow it off and nothing gets done. If you call the awareness line you lose your job when they are confronted. I had great reviews, did my job, was always positive and upbeat, always worked hard and was fired for petty reasons, Along with other good employees. Home Depot needs to comb through the management, because if your not military or gay you can bet you wont stay long. My co workers were awesome. The hardest part of my job was lack of intelligence among management. I made wonderful friendships while I worked there but I would NEVER refer someone to work there as long term employment."
bad,"Every day is a different experience, not time to get bore as you deal with daily challenges and work situations. I had learned to deal with people and to how to communicate and find solutions to provide customer service. I had seen different styles of leaderships and learned a little from all of them. Great group of people to work with and a big sense teamwork inside the building. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customer while trying not to loose it and maintaining professionalism. The best part the job is when you are rewarded by a heart felt thank you! from a happy satisfied grateful customer."
bad,i didnt like working here because the management wasnt very good
bad,"The company is a decent company to work for, however the management was extremely poor. The work load to compensation ratio was terrible and the management team was lazy. Because of the high turn over rate there is a lot of variety in opportunities but I wouldn't recommend working there. Also I was scheduled against my availability over 6 different times, worked 40+ hour weeks without being switched to full time and had my schedule changed against my will over 10 times."
bad,The people who have been working there would have everything go wrong blamed on you and management would believe them.
bad,provide knowledgeable and curtious customer service across whole store
bad,"I was underpaid. I was doing 3 peoples jobs. The place is so understaffed. They schedule you at bad times. I feel sorry for the customers that can't come to the store in the morning or midday because if you come in at any other time of the day, there won't be anyone to help you or they'll look at you like you're crazy when you ask for it forcing people like me to increase their workload to pick up on other peoples slack like I already didn't have a million other things to do."
bad,"Although being handy is not a prerequisite to working for this company, common sense is.  Unfortunately there is no way to determine this during the interview process.  Typically you can find yourself doing damage control for your fellow employees that do not have a similar work ethic.  Product knowledge (PK) is a strong point that THD emphasizes and encourages; this is available to all employees therefore allowing associates the best opportunity to help customers.  The management style is clearly top down.  The top, although approachable most times, are likely to hear rather than listen.  I'm sure this varies by area within the organization.  It is clear however that decisions are made without consideration of how the management's vision impacts the day to day operations of face to face communication and interaction with customers. Often times, the best part of working there is going home at the end of ones shift."
bad,"It could be a good place to work, if it was staffed properly. Many times you are busy helping people in other departments, that you can't attend to customers waiting in your department. Forget about a family life, as you can be scheduled to start at 1pm leave at 10pm, and return to work at 7am. It is quite common for employees to be fired for any  reason, if you are near a 10 yr. anniversary. There is no real sense of human resource, as there is one person for an entire district. There are very few minorities in  higher positions.Longtime Part-time worker's hours are cut when sales are slow, or when new temporary workers are hired. At one time it was a really great place to work."
bad,"I do not have insight as to whether or not this is company wide, but at the Hillsboro branch this is what I experienced."
bad,"its home depot, it was a job. helped customers, stocked shelves."
bad,This company is not recommended to work at. Even many of their employees ( long term) grumble that the company is unkind to its employees. YOU FIND OUT ALOT as an independant sales rep for them.
bad,just helping out customers during the day. learned more about different types of wood and hardwear and mixing paints management there was not a plus only one person of team of six manager help out . my coworkers loved me i helped everyone and made the day go by fast. hardest part of my job was trying to make a lead in sales after a customer was spending hundreds with me already but i still tried.
bad,There is only  part-time jobs available.  As a single mother need more hours.
bad,Just felt like the supervisor wasnt sufficiently trained the hours were bad and the pay rate wasnt as good
bad,Management does not treat employees well for personal reasons. Everyone is at part-time and it is very hard to advance positions
bad,"You come in and pull all of the freight from receiving with a pallet jack. As you are pulling the heavy pallets down the raceway you have to stop and help customers because they do not have enough associates to cover the sales floor. Once the store closes the majority of the work takes place; finding a home for the overstock, making tags for the pallets, and lifting them into place."
bad,I was always told to move faster and faster. There was no Positive feedback.
bad,A working day at home depot consisted of trying to complete as many tasks as possible with out adequate support. Under the premisce the customer is always right it is very likely you can be spoken to with very little respect and certainly can be under appreciated by management and your fellow team memebers.
bad,"el poco tiempo que dure ,quise dar a conocer mi manera de trabajar dar todo los posible por sobre salir pero los mismos encargados de las promos ,te dan la esalda a esto le sumo el bajo sueldo,por suerte no tengo familia que mantener ,de ser asi no hubiera sido un trabajo rentable."
bad,"good place to work but not to progress.nice to work with people and meet customers.I also liked learning new things but,as for management I'd say overall experience needs inprovement."
bad,"You'll get the hours but if you show a shred of talent or ability your used to the fullest extent without any rewards, As a hard workers you constantly get used and quickly begin to wonder why your there, honestly the happiest moment of my working there was leaving."
bad,I learned a lot working here.  Stay on the good side of upper management and learn how to close your mouth say yes to whatever they want.  Standing for what you believe in and backing your people up will get you nowhere except out the door.  I learned many things in the years that I worked here and met a lot of good people.  I was not willing to conform and sacrifice my beliefs so they little by little broke me down and got me out.  I do not miss it. My stress level despite still being unemployed is considerably less.  
bad,"The hardest part of my job is waiting for customer to come to our store in order to provide services we offer. I like to be productive and not waste time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to teach something to the customer about our services, in order to help educate them so they can make the right decision for themselves."
bad,"A typical day at work would involve a high volume of interaction with customers, a lot of questions being asked, signing customers up for home depot credit cards, doing cash strips. The hardest part of my day would be when I was unable to get customers approve for credit. What I enjoyed most was the constant contact with customers and helping them, I enjoyed working in a face paced environment. I learned many things about home improvement."
bad,"A typical day at work is solving customers complaint, selling different products, and also offering what you think can meet the customer needs."
bad,"Managers use the buddy system, corruption, buddy system problems.  If you are the wrong color, or sex you cannot advance.  Managers disrespect employees.  Pay is very good, benefits are very good as well.  Hours are excellent!  The company is taking advantage of the poor job economy, they have drifted from their values and treating customers and employees horrible.  Using the buddy system to promote.  Don't bother applying."
bad,"A typical work day is pretty much answering phones. Assisting customers. The higher up management is ok, the ones immediatley below are unreasonable and like to play favorites. Room for advancement in this company is unlikley if you are not on the ""list"". The work/life balance is not at all what they told us it would be. The very first day they told us that they understood that we all had family and they were going to be an employer that would work with that. Now however 9 months in, they are unbendable and unreasonable, if there is a death in your family...too bad... if there are 4 hours between breaks....too bad... Deal with it. That is their attitude on most things. I cannot tell you how many times I have been told, "" If you cant do it find another job""."
bad,Work is usually fast paced but it gets hectic if someone in management has failed to have proper store coverage due to misscheduling. I love the face to face contact with customers and being able to educate them on products that we carry. The hardest part of the job is when the temperature reaches over 100 and we are swamped outside with people wanting pallets and loads of bricks and it's only 1 person there to provide that to them. They become impatient and we lose sales. The greatest part of my job is knowing I have made a difference in someone's life just by providing them with the warm friendly customer service that I take pride in.
bad,"I was a stock clerk here, and it was ok for my first job because I still lived with my parents and didn't have bills. The maximum hours a week I could get was 20. Could be a decent second job I guess."
bad,"As a cashier, I enjoy the day-to-day contact with the customers, especially in our town. The majority of my co-workers are very nice, and that is probably the biggest reason I continue to work at Home Depot. The quality of the middle managers at the store level leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion, which is one of the biggest drawbacks of working there, as well as the hourly pay being very low. They do offer decent benefits to permanent full-time and part-time employees though, such as medical and dental insurance, 401K plan with company matching, employee stock purchase plan at a 15% discounted rate, and Success Sharing twice per year. There is opportunity to move up in the company, if you enjoy the retail sales industry, which I do not care for, and have no interest in pursuing."
bad,no room for advancement not judged by work ethic judged by favoritism
bad,"When I first began working at Home Depot, the environment was fun, challenging, and the hours flew by. Over the years, as the management in Atlanta changed, the store level management became more concerned with their reports and numbers than training and mentoring associates on the floor. They forgot that the store associates are their most important assests, and treating them unfairly and with contempt, will not produce exceptional customer service. Work was no fun anymore."
bad,I was able to work full time hours and attending a local University full time because Home Depot was able to work with my hours. Home depot has a reasonable attendance policy but very poor benefits
bad,"The job changed over my time there. It started with a sense of respect for employees and trade specialists and slowly moved away from that. For the first four to five years I did every thing from customer service, to stock ordering and sales analysis. The work was hard but I felt respected and appreciated. It was one of the better jobs I'd ever had. With a change in top management the culture changed, experienced professionals became expensive deadweight instead of valued resources and the general employees attitude slowly became embittered and callous. Store management still talked about providing excellent and personalized customer service but their actions didn't support it. I should have left before I did, but I stubbornly held onto my dream job failing to recognize that the company had changed and I needed to change too. All in all I learned quite a lot about customer service, team building, and running a business. I really enjoyed the rapid fire problem solving and the ability to make a positive impact in the lives of my customers."
bad,"Typical day started with calling all of our sales team to review previous days successes. Followed up on sold deals and deals that may be closed at a later date. Checked the Lead Management System for the days scheduled appointments and who is is assigned to them. Management meeting were in the form of a teleconference to tie all CA sales managers together at one times. I found this to be very unproductive as the sales production goals were based on unrealistic expectations from leadership that was never in the field, or didn't act on the true market picture when reported. Hardest part of the job was being asked to 'take that hill' without the proper resources or realistic expectations. It seemed that the business was being managed from a spreadsheet that had incomplete or inaccurate data. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my sales team, developing new sales reps, meeting with our customers to offer the very best we had in the way of service."
bad,"Was hired as part time and was given full time hours with no pay increase nor full time benefits. For the first three months I was given the worst shifts because seniority trumped new hires. Five months in my schedule was changed from building and lumber to over night Inventory which clashed with my schedule. Did not bother informing me before hand of the change. The part time position did not pay hardly enough as a full time empolyee and if a part time employee were to apply for benefits, half of their pay check would go to that meaning a shamefull $600 biweekly check was cut to $300. When I confronted them about my hours and if i could get a full time posotion because i was already working the hours, they said they would concider it and reduced my hours for the remainder of my months i lasted with them. Management would work you to the bone and then tell you to come in at a later time on your next scheduled work day so the over time aquired would make up for the shorter day schedule."
bad,fired for saying speak english to a coworker manament was ok to mutch work for overnight the hardest part of the day was gleanup.
bad,Working there for three years even if there was a possiblity i wanted to advance it would not be possible as you got to know someone higher up just to move up.
bad,Management was never around when needed and pay was super low for the amount if stress invovled with the job.
bad,"worked at front end cashier, co-workers were great, but the commuication was just not there. Training was good, but was not implemented out on the floor."
bad,"productive and fun place to work, but sesonal business. knowledgable job. enjoy to learn lots with customers, for customer services, cash register exprience, processing cash, cheque, credit and debit cards. providing telephonic and face to face sale and answer to inquiries."
bad,"Just as bad as WALMART employees are disposable. Even if a customer falsely accuses you, oh well we take their word for it even though its not in your character. We show distinct favortism. But they do make sure they meet their quota when it comes to white to minority ratio. ; )"
bad,"Would be a good company to work for if you could get a f/t position. I'm not sure if it was just the store that I worked for or if happens in the other stores as well but, the management does not practice fair hiring and advancement practices. That coming from my personal experience and that of others. Otherwise friendly co-workers great customers and products."
bad,"Management is trained to be heartless and could careless that you have a life outside of the company, everything is about the company. They are so greedy for money that they are only closed for Thanksgiving and Christmas, with that in mind don't bother requesting holidays off because they will deny it. The claim to be a family based employer however they are not. They rid employees to the breaking point, often breaking many rules. Pay is a disgrace, unless grown people can live off minimum wage. Overall not the best place to work, more like a last resort."
bad,"Customer service-loading vehicles and directing customers to desired products, maintaining the front end of the store"
bad,"Work on Morning Reports such as markdown done on the store systems, balance dues, reviews markdowns on customer's special orders."
bad,management is terrible. Leadership is a good Ol' boys club. Fellow employees are great. The hardest part of the job was sitting down to supper and having the BB go off and my boss yelling. There was no personal time. Best was leaving the company
bad,I was always busy in different areas of the firm. Great!
bad,"For 5 years I busted my tail for a company that doesn't care about you, or your family and what you have to do. The only thing they care about is themselves. The managers I worked for were the worst managers I've ever had in my life. The associates I managed were the stupidest people I'd ever seen. The compensation I received was the least for any department head. Running a specialty department you think you would receive more. Ha, yeah right. The HR for this company is a joke as well. No communication whatsoever, and they ""forget"" to do simple things such as put your vacation time in so your LOA can begin. Oh, and getting a transfer to another store is an absolutely joke as well. Don't bother telling them its an emergency situation, they will just not care even more. Terrible, terrible place to work."
bad,Every day was hectic; I really enjoyed helping the customers in a number of different departments. I learned a lot about face-to-face customer service and problem-solving in a retail setting.
bad,"This company demands allot but does not reward those who work harder than others. The managers put you in a different spot everyday, where ever they see fit. Very poor communication form bosses. There are no benefits you get from this muti-million dollar company if your an employee. The friendship and communication for co workers that work along side you is very good, everyone tries to keep each other positive. A typical day includes standing and waiting for customers to come to your register. you cannot sit at any time."
bad,I like working their because they work on my schedule.
bad,A typical day of work is taking 30-50 calls a day
bad,Customer's are great. Working hours are 55 if you are lucky. Usually about 75 to 80.
bad,A typical day at work is ringing on the register to make sure the customer have purchased their items in a timely manner. I've learned a few things about gardening and tiling. The cashiers I work with are great; really friendly and outgoing. I will miss them when I find another job.
bad,"They would rearrange your work schedule without discussing it with you. They didn't treat me or other employees with respect, this was management. They were kind of clicky, didn't like that, hard to make friends and to trust anyone. Just an overall horrible working experience for me."
bad,"Where to begin. The core values are great and that's about it. The schedule is nights and weekends, never the same, hard for anyone with a family. Pay is low, no opportunities to earn more."
bad,For this to be a good place to work it is important to get in the right department.
bad,"the company was great in its hey-day, but corporate think is killing them. ""Lets see how many untrained part timers we can get while management hides in the office is not the way to run a company...."
bad,"In My time working at the home depot it was a fun work environment with cook outs and Christmas parties, however i was lied to by management on several occasions. Management is not concerned about and employees with illnesses or injury's or their employees for that matter. they only seem to be concerned about money. About a month after i stopped working here i went back in the store and aside from management their were only 3 people who still worked here from when i worked here. My guess based on my experience with them is that right before the everyone who had been there long enough to get the bonus based on store sales could, management found reason to get rid of them so they could pocket that money for themselves. It would also explain why Home Depot has such a high turn over rate."
bad,"I was so happy to get a job here how cool right?!? Nope! It’s corporate, you are a number and they literally don’t Care about the employees and who is hired and fired. Why they have a hiring event every year!  "
bad,"This company puts on a front that they care about the associates, but it’s a front to suck you in and steal your soul.. Only work here if you are desperate"
bad,Assistant managers put in a lot of hours with a unwritten rule/expectation that you work longer shifts. High stress to deliver results and solve the majority of customer issues caused by a third party in the store with little or any support from the 3rd party which could care less about what Home Depot`s claimed values are.
bad,"Its a corporation that puts its employees last, I have seen many long time employees let go for superficial reasons.  Unless you are full time you can possibly be scheduled for as little as 10 hours per week."
bad,"Find something that does make you. There are always new businesses with new ideals and looking for better ones. don't subject yourself to a corporate system. As difficult as it may seem, it is not impossible."
bad,"Front end associates are supportive of each-other, though the opposite tends to be true for the rest of the store."
bad,"The values as described by Home Depot corporation are not those being practiced by their management staff. Seemed to be more of  a ""good old boys club"" than a professional corporation"
bad,Swerve. Bad management. Dull work. For people who wanna be comfortable doing mindless work for years. I do not recommend working here. Culture of the company is nice but doesn't really directly benefit you in anyway
bad,"The management of the store you are in makes a significant difference as to how tolerable the workplace is. Even in a well managed Home Depot, there is a consistent bias for men being more likely to get lift equipment licenses - especially the reach and forklift. We only had one girl in the store who knew how to use the forklift. If you say you want to work full time, they will schedule you to the bone and overtime, easily maxing 40 hours and not give days off. On peak hours, I worked 8 days in a row a few times. If you say you want to work part time, they will schedule you just under 20 hours so you won't have benefits. It's an army bootcamp environment, and you'll be miserable if you're not passionate or knowledgeable about the department you work in."
bad,Store managers are nice some employees are nice pay is horrible  head cashier manager not pleasant at all cashier are leaving cause of no hours and the pay  don’t hire fully time  I would not recommend working there unless have other jobs
bad,"There is some people there that I believe they are for themselves which is bull, and some of the managers that are very mean and hateful and they like to lie on the employee's and I don't like being talked down to like I'm stupid....."
bad,The culture of this company is based solely on who is running the ship that particular week. Lots and lots of turnover in all positions. Four managers in two years.
bad,"Impossible to balance work and personal life when you work 4 10 hour shifts overnight. Night Team does way more work than the day team and gets paid the same. No room for advancement, but job security is there, its really hard to get fired. Management cares more about quotas then the employees' safety. People you work with are cool, nice, and helpful, they are the only good part of the job."
bad,Part time and when you try to get extra hours you on the down graded list meaning you'll get your hours cut so bad it's not even worth going to work bad enough you start with 20 hours a week not as bad when you get cut to 12 hours or even 8 hours a week....
bad,"I applied to Home Depot in January of 2019, and after calling and calling and going up to the store multiple times, I finally got an interview in April. They hired me on and in the first shift, I could tell something was off. It was finals season in college and I needed time to study and prepare for exams. I told them I could only work up to 20 hours those coming weeks with such a heavy workload, and they agreed. The only thing was, they didn't do that at all. They instead scheduled me 45 hours and refused to change it. They then told me if I didn't show up for 3 of my shifts they would have to fire me, again all these shifts were scheduled at time I either had a final or needed to study for one. So ultimately I had to leave Home Depot which was rather unfortunate, the other sales associates were very nice and helpful when starting, but the upper management was terrible."
bad,"sometimes we didnt even get breaks, which were required every two hours according to the hours of training videos i had to sit through. i met some cool people while working there that im still friends with to this day. management gave me the feeling of disrespect."
bad,"I learned what its like to work retail it was long, exhausting, and the managers were always angry with everybody. There was decent work place culture, but  the worst part was loading 60-150lbs of appliances or wood into customers cars. The best part was break time."
bad,The attendance policy is made to get rid of people. Advancement is all about who you know. Its very political. The work isn't enjoyable. I enjoy working in an actual warehouse than home depot
bad,Must have good customer service skills and be level headed to deal with some of the customers.  Depending on the department you will have to do a lot of lifting and climbing ladders.  You can get a lift license to run some of the machines but you will not get any compensation for it.  You do not get any discounts working at HD.  It can be stressful because nowadays you work shorthanded.
bad,This was a part time job. Home Depot works the people that work hard to death. There are lazy people in the store that just skate by. Lot of busy work....move this here...nope looks better back there. Incentive were a joke.
bad,No support from upper management. Does not live up to or operate by their core values.  No such thing as inverted pyramid of support.  Continuous lies to cover inadequate leadership
bad,Worked at Home Depot for a few months this spring/summer on nights. Avg around 30 to 35 hours a week. Night Management at this store was VERY interested in your every move. And made you feel like you shouldn’t be taking your 15 minute break every 2 or 3 hours. And you better not go one minute over or under on your lunch break. Just made you feel uneasy and not comfortable. Would not recommend.
bad,"This Home Depot is one of the worst places I have ever worked. The management is terrible, they verbally abuse workers and only promote the wrong people. "
bad,"There were four asms at my store and each none of them actually cared about us, they only cared about what their bosses wanted, and they would continually hire useless people and expect the few that were competent to pick up the slack"
bad,"Over worked & underpaid long hours. Long hours, short staffed. Need better pay.  Benefits good. Need more hourly workers. Needs employee floater to give breaks"
bad,"Took the job due to a great need for income but soon came to regret it. For the work load to pay rate do not come close to being appropriate. Upper management has too many excuses for being under staffed. Despite being understaffed they expect the same amount of work from a team of 4 people to do a workload of 10 people. When my peers asked for a raise due to the workload and new certifications. They were told no due to a hiring freeze. Only to tell my supervisor that He was working hard on new hires. How can it be both? You  are told you will be managing product and putting products on selves. However in reality, you will be doing everything from steel work to electrical wiring. You are basically doing construction work and getting paid to face product. The company basically lies to your face."
bad,"Management not really present for issues that are ""concerning"" to the company. Other people working there are easy to get along. If you get along with management it's easier for you to move on up."
bad,Rules of HR are constantly broken. It is a large powerful company so whistleblowers are fired and pushed out quickly whether they were in the wrong or somewhat! Very poor management but the stores continue to make lots of money so they really do not care about their associates.
bad,"Retail store, the main tasks are customer service and stocking the shelves. Easy job, easy pay. Just need to possess limitless patience with management and supervisors; unreasonable people and hotheaded. Generally sexist and racist. Ran by a bunch of boomers."
bad,"Hme Depot started out to be a fun job but as retail faltered, they "
bad,"I spent 11 1/2 yrs here and knew a lot about the company and my job, I considered myself a  valued  Associate. When I was force to find a better paying job I turned in my 2 weeks notice and they could have cared less. I left making 11.50 an hour"
bad,Upon the weather getting colder my hours have been cut from an average of 25-30 hours per week to under 10 hours per week which leads to some insanely unsatisfactory pay checks. The worst part is that it is only due to the fact that if more employees are working and getting paid the manager won't be achieving the sales plan anymore.
bad,"The culture of Home Depot is very clicky which makes it hard to advance to a management position. "
bad,In the time I was there we had four different managers two supervsors and 14 salesmen. t was chaotic at times. The postion was commission only plus mileage. You did lot of driving. One day my frst appointment was in Lakewood. The next appointment was in Rancho Cucamonga.
bad,"my Supervisor is great!  As far as the other work conditions, it is ok.  It's close to home and easy to get in and out. There does not seem to be any quality control when employees are chosen and I will let you read between the lines."
bad,In all it was alright. Most employees did complain about working there and did complain about management. A typical day working there is just interacting with customers and helping them.
bad,It is a good place to work with other employees. You are always working other departments because they can keep good help. The manager at my store was not very good. He didn't really care about the little people because he knew he could replace you. The assistant managers and supervisors were very caring! The pay was bottom of the barrel and they always promised more money but never gave it
bad,"This company is a multi million dollar operation.. yet they pay newer based employees junk wages for what they expect. Home Depot in past years 10 - 15 years ago would pay their employees an excellent starting wage, now you'll start out just around minimum wage. If you have a family "
bad,"Store manager is horrible, department heads have no say and have little direction, and associates are taken for granted and have no say in the work place. The company's ""core values"" are not followed by upper management."
bad,really didn't work there never got paid taxes for that bad work career like the job but was there as a temp did like it at all if they was to hire me back i would like to work in another location
bad,"The reason I say The Home Depot is alright because YES it's good pay for the area. Yes the have decent benefits and everything associated with a warehouse job. My only MAJOR gripe with The Home Depot is when a person gets injured they are considered less than garbage."
bad,"Felt like I worked my hardest for little to no appreciation or compensation  If they paid more and didn’t leave the night shift out of their parties, things might have been better there"
bad,"I'm a current employee of Home Depot got hurt on the job work comp denied me and 10 days after going on LOA after being hospitalized forOver a week they canceled my health insurance. Up until this I thought Home Depot cared about their employees they proved me wrong. "
bad,"I was told by management that they know they have a problem when it come to how the store is run, and the lack of space. But they are trying to make it better."
bad,"Typically my job involves cleaning up and packing out the concrete aisle, fencing, and cinderblocks. Whenever I'm done with those duties I'll go inside the store to the main lumber aisle and help with cleaning and packing out there. Management seems to constantly overlook the work I do and nitpick the little things that I do. Whenever I think that I'm doing well and working above what is expected I hear complaints about minor things that have nothing to do with my work ethic."
bad,If you are a 18 year old child that wants no responsibilitys and to hardly work and just wants to go to work talk and hangout and gossip about drama. push off the work. Do you wanna deal with manager's that only tell you what to do and never help you out this is the job for you.
bad,Its a nice company to work for its just the management team is not right. They go on assumptions in stead of doing the footwork. And I that they are harder on people of color than any other race. All though they don't tell you about that when you are in there.
bad,"store was ok ,management was ok, i would work for the company again just not the location or that manager again."
bad,I worked extremely hard it positions a hail I was looked over when it came to promotion time lies  Even one I had taken a test when i do the extremely well along them i was promised my job back but lies were told then also
bad,I spend my days at work teaming up with fellow associates assisting customers with projects while unloading trucks and restocking shelves through the day
bad,"Working at home depot was an unfortunate venture not only for myself, but others that work there as well. I was expected to do multiple jobs, but only getting paid for one, then getting blamed for not performing my job well enough although because im asked to do other peoples jobs. The tools that i repair for customers did not count towards my numbers for the month as well as working as an associate assisting customers with rental contracts and penske truck rentals. The only thing that counted towards my numbers were the tools being rented out on the floor. So hypothetically if there were no tools that needed to be repaired on the floor then it reflected poorly on my record. Basically this was a work environment that set you up for failure before you even walked into the building."
bad,"tasking and customer service is always pushed "
bad,"Management could be more hands on, scheduling could improve, team work is good as long as the right people are there. Work loads are nice an easy and the work is straight forward."
bad,The work is ok there buy management is horrible. Some days are very light in freight and then you get slammed the next. Managers want to be friends with associates instead of being their boss.
bad,I dont agree with the hiring at home depot.  They only hire temp part time. After 90 days they can let you go. But if they put you on and you ask for full time hours they will not give them to you. You are still classified as a part time employee.  Therefore you will only get 32 hours a week max.
bad,"The benefits offered to full time associates are the best thing that you will ever get from this company. Management never tries to hide their favoritism, from my experience as well as the general consensus from co-workers both on-site and from other locations. They'll promote the people they like, even when they're lazy and can't do even half of their job without relying on the rest of their department to carry their dead weight. If you're any kind of minority, tread with caution, they will believe everyone else about what goes on, and their ""investigation"" basically involves them asking you your side of things, and then taking the other person's side instead. Be wary of the days management gets together for meetings. There's supposed to be at least one manager on the floor in case any departments or customers need assistance, but most of the time all of the ASMs, and all the department supervisors end up in the meeting with their phones shut off and don't respond to any pages, regardless of how urgent. If you work the front end (service desk or cashier), you're expected to carry the store. Other people in the sales departments can become a backup cashier for when you get busy or if you need coverage because of call outs, but half the time they don't respond, nor are they held accountable for not responding. If you get a bad survey on your receipt, even if the bad parts are about other departments, you're going to be the one getting a talking to. There was almost never someone available to cover my breaks and lunches, but somehow that was always my fault. They push credit so"
bad,Their management was lazy. They never could keep employees. The computer system was easy to control. The other cashier were very friendly and helpful.
bad,"Communication between management and employees poor. Management had favored certain people. The type of people they hire there is bad, just personally wasn’t a good experience for me."
bad,"Lets face it, Home Depot is a US company. That said management looks at staff as grunts whose job it is to do what they are told without question. My new store manager didn't acknowledge my existence for the first 7 months he was there. The only time he called me by name was when he fired me."
bad,"If you are not female under 40 and do not care to build your advancement on the degradation of the other employees. You can count on not getting promoted to management above dept supervisor. If you work hard and extra hours you can count on them cutting your staff or help until you are alone and you are held accountable for the performance of your dept, until you are evaluated low enough to leave or face termination."
bad,Worked with a lot of really great people and made lifelong friends here but management liked to play favorites and they all take their little Home Depot jobs way too seriously and literally expect you to bleed orange and live for the company.
bad,Worry more about meeting number than its employes and that is why i am seeking another job they lack communication skills and only want whats best on paper.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,"If you aren’t going to school and are ok with getting screwed over by management, this is the place for you. They refused to take me down to part time once I started school and told me that I either need to work my full 40 hours a week or find a new job. I worked hard to get back into school and wasn’t about to sacrifice my grades for a job that wasn’t willing to work with me. I’ve worked here for 6 years in 4 different departments and volunteered to do  projects no one else wanted to do and this is how they treated me. Trust me on this and look somewhere else."
bad,"Over worked, under paid. Management expects you to give, give, give and they want to pay as little as possible. Holidays are a most to work - especially Christmas. Co-workers were mostly decent people. In the same boat as you, to include Department management."
bad,"La empresa es muy noble y propicia un buen ambiente entre compañeros y clientes. Lamentablemente los ""lideres"" buscan la manera de tenerte bajo amenazas laborales con metas absurdas y tareas fuera de tu responsabilidad y más allá de tu horario de trabajo sin ninguna compensación o pago extra. Y si no accedes te tachan de negativo te corren y te hacen firmar renuncia para no darte lo que corresponde. NO LA RECOMIENDO."
bad,Unless your a young female don’t plan on getting promoted. They will promote females over a much more qualified male. Leaving the more qualified person to do more to compensate for the lack of knowledge and experience the female manager has. They are all about female in management even at the cost of running a profitable business. Unfortunately due to the lack of success if their competitors they will still make money. But could be a much more profitable business with the right people running the buisness
bad,It was okay for the experience but the job I had there was not as full filling as I thought management was very rude. We had a new store manager came in and wasn't able to make his mind up when it came down to figureing out what to do about placement of products
bad,The most unorganized company I have ever seen in my life.  I would suggest staying away unless you want to be an admin because their buyers do nothing but fix issues others created
bad,"Home Depot could be a good place to work if they just practiced what they constantly tell you is their job mission or company mantra, but its all BS. Safety is talked about constantly, get help if you need help or Team up in HD speak, but they try to run the place with about half of the people needed to cover a large warehouse. Plenty of equipment to work with but you are supposed to have a spotter and guess what, no one available, then you are told that your time management is the problem."
bad,"I was hired as a call center supervisor and while the compensation was fair the job itself was unprofessional, disorganized, lacked consistent leadership and no accountability or fairness. I would not recommend."
bad,"I worked for Home Depot for almost 4 years. When I initially started I was only part-time but I also had the opportunity to get extra hours. Well, the end of December 2015 I applied for the Merchandising Execution Team (MET). I did get the job and the supervisor we had for the 1st year wasn't so bad. But she she choose to demote herself for personal reasons. The supervisor we got after her. He was very disorganized, had a problem with us asking questions and was very disrespectful. He didn't know how to speak to people and was even more disrespectful to his elders. If you are thinking about becoming a MET associate at the Lafayette, La (Ambassador) don't do it. If he is still the Supervisor run the other way. Upper mgnt doesn't know what it going on and even when we would explain our grievances nothing was done. He even Besides him I really enjoyed my co-workers."
bad,"Way to much favoritism, employees never on the work floor, always hiding some place.  Customers told me all the time, I'm the only employee they could find.   Management protects their favorite employees and run off the good employees.  Store I worked at, had all black managers and they favored  the black employees."
bad,"Home Depot is a great company and an awesome place to work. However, the MET team is said to be part of the Home Depot but is in fact it’s own little company within. We were offered benefits that were unaffordable with our pay and were always walked on by the store staff and customers."
bad,"After a change in immediate supervisors, the entire freight team was subjected to racist jokes, degrading and snide comments, verbal abuse, and threats by the new supervisor.  Despite being informed of issue, management refused to address the problem and promptly lost several experienced members of the team. Since then, the constant turnover in that department makes it obvious that the problem still exists."
bad,management did nothing to support me when i asked for help during the busy season. i was the only associate coordinating the orders. I usually worked through my lunches to help out the receiving team because they were also understaffed.
bad,"It is hard physical labor and being bombarded with questions from customers about everything in the store. It doesn't matter which department you are in, people ask about things from all parts of the store. Sime co-workers and managers are helpful, others are not. You are left to swim on your own frequently."
bad,"Management lacks the ability to staff properly, they are very unorganized, They do not hold people accountable for not doing their job but rather put it on the workload of people that do their jobs!"
bad,Poor attitude is a huge problem with the majority of the people that work there. The customer service dept. Is rude and ignorant and talk down to fellow employees and customers. There are more bosses than associates. They also have staff who act like they are the only ones who do any work. The same ones who will spend their day changing what was just completed by a manager or another
bad,I had no issue working as a cashier at Home Depot. Once you get the hang of it it’s actually chill and your co workers are friendly. You may have a handful of rude customers that may try you. My main concern was the availability that you give management in the beginning is apparently fixed and they don’t care if you have other things to pertain (school/2nd job) Management were disrespectful MAIN reason why I left
bad,Always under staffed in almost every department. Employees are often not taught proper procedures. Management is quick to say/do whatever to meet certain company goals.
bad,"They pay less than McDonald's and offer part time.  Who would want that?  You can flip a burger for more play and less stress.  I mean, come on.  Get with the times."
bad,"Most of the management was hard to approach. They were not very understanding if there was an issue, and they never really seemed to back you........."
bad,The last time. I was late. I take public transportation to and from to work this day the. M bus broke down @the Galleria I proceeded to call my floor manager and informed him of the situation another bus arrived it to it broke the Bus system were so kind they called a emergency. Van to take each passenger to our destination infew days the fired me they even. Refused my unemployment. I was there a. Year
bad,"Very labor intensive with little chance for advancement. "
bad,management really needs to try harder. Don't give their employees the respect they deserve. But it was enjoyable in the sense that coworkers helped out.
bad,"There isn't a work/life balance if you are a store associate. "
bad,Store management sucks. They don’t know how to properly schedule people. And pay sucks. You will regret working here. The only decent thing about working at the Home Depot is some people that work here are nice and friendly.
bad,"The rules don't apply to everyone. "
bad,"Atlanta corporate office controls the air conditioning which isn’t good since they don’t realize how humid and muggy it is here. "
bad,You meet a lot of people working at The Home Depot. And you could get to know a lot of the regular customers too. I tried working full time but I got turned down to work full time. My co workers caused a lot of drama. And I prefer to work in a drama free place.
bad,"This job, among other retail jobs are NOT for people who need to support a family or bills. This is for people who are either in college, retired or just super lucky and do not really need a job."
bad,"The Home Depot sets standards for employees to follow but many don't take those into consideration. I wouldn't recommend because of the drama that takes place within each department. Managers are friendly to each other but could care less about another's department. Even going to the extent to degrade the department and how the other manager would ""clean"" or ""packdown"". The Home Depot is not a team as they advertise, its to each your own company."
bad,"It's decent for a first job, but not long term. They say they care about their Home Depot family and about your personal life, but it's all politics there."
bad,I hate this job only because the company doesn’t care about there associates well being it’s Avery stressful job some of the managers are nice and then you have some that doesn’t care as long as you get the work done
bad,"If you aren't working your a** off to get things done or slack for a second management will be all over you, and if you're sales aren't good enough they will cut your hours till you are working maybe 12 hours in two weeks. Maybe."
bad,"Worked at 3rd Avenue 59th Street location for almost 3 years."
bad,"Would have been a much better job if it was managed properly. Very bad hours. Sometimes 3 hours a week, sometimes 25. No one seemed to know how to properly do their own job."
bad,"I worked at several Home Depot’s in my time. In all locations, management was poor and lazy. They’d do anything to get over on the employees. They were grown children who constantly monitor over employees and look for reasons to discourage an employees hard working effort. I was extremely unsatisfied with their professionalism within the store as well. Managers would lust after employees."
bad,Cashiers start out 10.00 hourly... Pro cashier make 11.00 hourly and lot attendance make 9.00 hourly. This  job is only used to gain work experience. Nothing more!
bad,"As a part-time employee, I did not receive the benefits of full-time workers and can only answer my experience."
bad,I had a manager that was very mean and had a very short fuse. Who will go off on you for little or nothing. I had good co workers i had great co workers to work with
bad,The company has no relation between management and lower level workers. You’re promised advancement and then it’s given to someone they like more regardless of their qualifications. Company is great but the inner store issues are terrible. Work somewhere else unless you plan to do the minimum and not care.
bad,"the team leader picked the leads "
bad,"Not a very good place to work. Low wages and too many classes to take. The benefits are very expensive, no culture or job security. No room for advancement."
bad,Policies are followed when it suits them. Petty and unqualified managers in the levels. Upper management only hires lower management that will work themselves to death so upper management will look good. If you don’t they block your options for transfer or advancement.
bad,"During my time at Home Depot, I found the job to be very unorganized and stressful. Depending on which line manager or head cashier was working, the procedures on receiving a register increase, discount approval, and calling for assistance changed. One day the rule was xyz and then the next I would do xyz, be told I was wrong, and told I was actually meant to to abc. I worked there for four months and the rules changed literally every week. Training was very poor as there was never any official training process. The other new hires and I were told to sit and watch others for a day then thrown onto a register the next day. I often got confused because procedures were never clear and was told by one line manager I needed to “grow up and figure this out on my own because they couldn’t monitor my every move.” I understand how it can be frustrating when I asked so many questions, but when I didn’t receive REAL training and the rules changed every day, it’s hard to catch on. On another note, nothing in the store has a sku or upc on it. You need to look everything up in the online cashier book, where half the things didn’t have accurate descriptions or matching pictures, so you don’t know if you’re even clicking the right thing. If you couldn’t find it on the OCB you needed to call the department, and half the time the phone would ring without any answer, leaving you a frustrated customer. The only enjoyable part of being there was my coworkers. They were all a joy to be around and were really accepting and helpful when the managers weren’t around to help. Everyone is generally really"
bad,"The Home Depot is an interesting job to have. In the beginning you enjoy working there, but slowly begin to feel as though you're drowning. You have to work holidays and most likely nights. They say they will work with your schedule, but don't really. You can ask for something off three months in advance and they still won't give it to you. There is no support, no positive feedback. All the managers do if push you away when you need help and have negative comments. You will feel as though you've spent your entire life in there suffering. Only benefit is bonuses and minimal holiday pay."
bad,Morale was poor. Management tended to look out for themselves and the chosen few favorites. Hard workers were neglected and usually left. If you were valuable as an associate you weren't chosen to move up because their often wasn't another worker with a strong work ethic to fill the void. Employee Stock Participation Plan was a nice benefit you could enroll in after 1 year of full time work. Theirs lots to learn if you ask questions to the people you come in contact with.
bad,"typical day consists of unloading cargo trucks and sorting the freight onto the sales floor shelves, work on you own most of the time but team projects come on a weekly basis"
bad,Over worked and definitely underpaid. My hours were always cut even after working my butt off. My manager did everything she could to get me more hours but that did not work
bad,I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt but my experience was not the greatest however it is a great entry level position for so!done whom needs it
bad,"If you enjoy working for a company that will physically run you into the ground, then this is the place for you.  If you like your boss to call you at home, text you, or facebook message you after you get off then fill out the application.  Especially when they ask you to do projects that take all day and then you get your review and it says you are not to do projects, consider this a great place to work."
bad,Little hours and no growth and ur hours were all over the place. Never had set hours. Need better structure for employees and need a better place to have for employees
bad,"Trés bonne ecole pour apprendre sur la vente au détail des produits ainsi q,Apprendre la saisonnalité des stocks"
bad,", I mean it was a great work environment way customer service great peers gray employees will you be able to work with I wasn't there for that long so I maybe a year-and-a-half that was it"
bad,"Over worked for little Pay, Lot attendants have a large umbrella of work responsibilities, while other employees do very little. And management could care less about you."
bad,"Loved job, but management couldn't keep employees.  Freight manager consistently lost his clip board, blamed staff for taking it."
bad,Always packing down no one is there to cover for lunch short hand staff managers don't care about anyone  everyone gets in to anyways else business getting into other peoples department snitching for most little stuff
bad,not a good company to work for. Did not have a good 8 years there. The Company treats their staff horrible. The company has a very high turnover rate. Management does know how to manage.
bad,"Some days you work only a two hour shift, shifts are not flexible. I worked every weekend and kept my availability open for two years and never got ahead."
bad,Poor and bad store manager then and now. Loved working with my fellow associates. Store manager always talked down to his associates and didn't Seam to care about following his own rules. Cared more about the size of his quarterly bonuses then his performance  as a store manager
bad,"Home Depot Exteriors Sales Consultant position is a terrible job. You are expected to drive all over the state for appointments and many of those appointments are out of our scope of work. But we aren't paid for our time or our mileage. The company is so out of touch they even discourage you from calling to confirm these appointments. Its 100% commission which can pay well at times,They is also a lot of freedom in between appointments which is nice. But in winter the volume of appointments is so bad that you make almost nothing during the slowest months. Upper management is very poor at communication and SCs feel like we aren't even working for HD since we never hear about company changes and the direction of the position. Exteriors SCs work outside the stores and we are completely  on our own basically. It seems like the culture of store employees is much better than the culture of the exteriors division. I would not recommend this job to others."
bad,"Opened the door to the department on morning shift, checked and placed float in Point Of Sale terminal, dusted shelves and checked that the area is neat and tidy.  Received customers and answered any questions, restocked the shelves and placed power tools for repair in the repair area."
bad,"Poor management. Extremely large lack of communication from the top down. Poor pay. Surprised at the lack of benefits, and the cost of coverage for health insurance. Health insurance would have cost me nearly my whole check."
bad,The coworkers are great to work with but the management team is very lax. The hardest part of the job is how much they expect out of you. Another problem is being unrecognized for the hard work you do.
bad,decent job but home depot will do anything to not pay you a raise or provide a path for advancement.   as a big box retailer they are fine to work for but just know you will only make money if you make it to management.
bad,"Management plays favorites. Sorry if your not one of their favorites. When they would disappear, you'd get blamed. Also, if you needed to go the bathroom, it was a problem. Also when someone didn't do their work, you'd get blamed for it not done. Even though you knew nothing about it (Being in Garden Dept, and no one in painting. Where customers were waiting). Or say they called for you on the intercom, and there is no intercom in the Garden Dept. A radio would of solved the problem."
bad,"This was not a great company to work for in the exterior division, no gas, bad pay, not given customers names to call ahead and verify they were home, or qualify the lead. DROVE, DROVE, DROVE. NO GAS REIMBURSEMENT!"
bad,I enjoyed my six years at Home Depot. It was an energized work place. A good management team Fun place to work. Standing all day was tough on the legs.
bad,"I started because I was sick of working in the food business, but the management here is awful. Such as terrible lack of leadership from management, personal responsibility, and poor treatment of the lower employees."
bad,Home Depot is not a bad place to work but it depends on the location and your commitment. Store 6507 is the worst location to work at.. if you are not friends with management then things get tricky from there.  There are cliques and you have a better experience depending on who you make friends with. I would only recommend working here if its just a stepping stone or part time job.
bad,"The work place culture was weird ,some Associates were really rude and the store manager wasn't a very nice person, only worked there for 5 months so not much"
bad,I was in charge of taking care of all the cashier's needs as well as date entry of the monies each register had in them at the end of the day. I also made bank deposits and ordered supplies for the store as well as fixing or trouble shooting issues with equipment.
bad,I was working in the parking lot pushing cart. I asked to apply for another position making more because I needed the money to pay. They gave it to me but then cut my hours. So I was making the same amount as I was pushing carts.
bad,This was a great place to learn how many of these companies work. was recognized for my work and located where my skills could advance. fun place to work when i get close to retirement.
bad,Working at Home Depot has added stress to All Cashiers.  Cashiers are required to ask every single customer if they want to open a Home Depot charge account and also push Home Depot Protection Plans. Most customers do not want to hear it. They wish to be rung up for their purchase and leave the store. Customers seem to always be in a hurry!  Do not want one more thing to answer!
bad,"The home depot was once great place to work at a few years ago, but unfortunately most management in this company seem to promote a toxic work environment."
bad,"A typical day at work would be okay. While I worked at the Home Depot I learned, how to operate a register, I already had over 35 years of skills required to perform this position. For me the workplace culture was, typically ordinary. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the customer was totally satisfied, and left happy. The most enjoyable part of the job for me, was being able to associate with the customers. As I am a very social person."
bad,I do not have anything to a about working for home depot. I was young and it was one of my first jobs ever. It was a learning experience. I worked in the plumbing department. I wanted to pursue a different career.
bad,It was an unfriendly grind. All about the numbers. Unable to move out of a position if you are good at it. Pay was low and it seemed that a lot of the work was spent cleaning up after the person before. Managers I had could be downright sadistic at times
bad,"There was a time when this was a great company, but today advancement is almost impossible if you are over 30.  They also seem to try and phase out employees who have been there for a long time and thus are earning a high pay per hour than newer employees.  Training is a joke."
bad,"If you like retail, you will like Home Depot. Management has created a part time workforce that expects full time production. OK products, razor thin margins and tiny benefits."
bad,ive worked for this company and maybe it was just that particular home depot but the hours wasn't all great and there were many factors with management.
bad,"I  very much love working with the public, so that was the best part of the employment for me. The job its self was very stressful, very physical, and very demanding. If I had been in better physical shape at the time it would have been a much better fit for me."
bad,"You had to go in a fast pace to get the production that you need in order to finish your work day off, if you didn’t get the production you had to get by the end of the day, you will get a warning from your manager that if you do not produce more in a few days you will be fired."
bad,This was a temporary job that was local for me so it helped me but It wasnt something that wasnt meant to be permanent. It was helpful but didnt interest me much.
bad,I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with. The pay was not enough for the commute that I had to do. The boss that I had was not very good at communicating.
bad,"hated this job, the customers complained about everything and management always seemed to get on the employees about it when we couldn't help but do our job."
bad,"The pay was low so when hours were cut, was not enough to live on. Needed to find a position that paid more. Was not given much hands on training for this position/."
bad,"Home DEPO values performance but has different expectations from one employee to the next.All performance expections are not equal"
bad,"My day consisted of assisting customers by handling financial transactions, engaging in light conversation, boxing up larger orders as machinery and kitchen appliances. I must say I learned a great deal about hardware and was introduced to many products I had no knowledge of such as construction materials. Never a dull moment there. "
bad,"I didn't like working for this company there was a lot of favoritism making it very hard to move up in the company. Even with a college degree, they didn't want to work with me or train me for what I thought was the next level. Which for me would have been management."
bad,It was a great career prior to my cancer and then radiation treatments. After my cancer was cured I rested for a year and then created and started AWC My built form scratch company
bad,no one ever know what to  do managers wouldn't talk to each other so every time you did some thing like reset the racking a product the next day it would have to be redone cause a different manager would not like it a different way. there is no saport for any staff if you need help. the people that do most of the work get treaded like garbage an made to work harder while the people that slack off get rewarded.
bad,"The culture at the Home Depot is based upon the attachment of the management to the employee.  Many such as my self never received the recognition due that someone of my professional experience and career based upon management opinion and referral.  A typical day involved clocking in and reporting to whomever was in charge and receiving an assignment.  When an employee wanted to give input it was negatively received."
bad,I started out part time and stayed that way.  Couldnt get over 25 hours a week. So i requested 3-8 hour days for my week. No i had to work 5 days a week 5 hours.   They made it where it was hard to work a second job and i certainly couldnt pay my bills with just them.  My supervisor was an old lady over 65 who was Absent minded and couldnt remember anything.  And if you only work 5 hours you get one 15 minute break thats it.  Needless to say i worked there threw xmas and left.
bad,"Another company that has very few full time positions, and the part time positions do not have consistent hours. Pay is minimum, no matter what your experience. There are also those co-workers who disappear from the department and don't do their job leaving others to pick up the slack.  "
bad,Had to stock pallets with inventory sometimes heavy sometimes light. Pay was not acceptable for the work you had to do and the stress on the body. Expected way to much for little pay
bad,its a good place to work when the right people are on the floor. some management targeted some people that worked below them but that person is gone. but they have a fast turn over of employees
bad,"This place is always under staffed so you're over worked and under paid. High turn over rate which makes it hard to work there. It can be very stressful. "
bad,They literally hire anyone. Couldn’t do much when working as a cashier. They were friendly. It seems like people never really leave there which is fine.
bad,A typical Day includes but not limited to Watering The plants and Flowers. Stocking all tools equipment and supplies as well as offering Great Customer service
bad,"While working as a manager at this company I worked 10- 12 hrs daily. The pay was competitive, the benefits were average. In my opinion, the opportunity for advancement in upper leadership were very slim."
bad,"A typical day consisted of getting product ready for customers"
bad,"I was the fork truck driver I worked with contractors and roofing and lumber, saws, and concrete plumbing, and doors and windows. restocking. fill the dept up. and I was on the safety for the customers."
bad,"The managers don't talk to each other. The employees all hate working there, and while at work it feels like you are required to do everything on your own."
bad,"The Home Depot is a company that does not offer competitive pay depending on the position one works. A lumber associate that stays outside no matter the weather gets paid the same as a cashier that stays comfortably inside at all times. Not to mention lumber associates are piled into every department that needs forklift/ reach drivers. You get a review 2 times while only getting paid for the latter one. Don’t get your hopes up when it comes to getting a raise. They offer 0 cents - 35 cents MAX for part time people. It does not matter how hard you work. At the end of the day they will bust your back in lumber. Never ever work for lumber unless they want to pay you 2-3 dollars more than the starting wage trust me . Managers only care about their 3 - 10,000 dollar bonuses and the store manager only cares about their 30 - 80,000 + dollar bonuses they get. Oh yeah associates get from $75 - $700 depending on how long you’ve been a slave there. The only good thing about home depot is the people you work with. Other than that it’s not worth it!"
bad,"The company has some good features, need more assoc, not enough coverage, I was there 15 years and would have liked to still be there, I enjoyed my customers very much and was knowledgable in all departments"
bad,"I was cashier of the month twice and cashier of the year and I received only 33 cents increase after this year of working my b..t off.I followed the Company SOP and got the most credit card application. approvals and good customer surveys  than any other employee. All of my contractor and regular customers loved my work, some would even wait in line just to be served by me. And you see how I was rewarded for this hard work."
bad,"they are ok to work for, they do not favor schedule changes. you work your but off for nothing customers will call and give you great reviews and the company does not recognize there employees."
bad,A typical day consists of ringing up merchandise and product for the costumers. Setting up displays and showing costumers how to use product is also part of the job. A final task of the day is to make sure all costumers find and locate and product they normally have a hard time finding or knowing the location of.
bad,ALmost no FT jobs. Store manager is largely absent. Management/HR don't know how to handle employees with medical issues. This is the desert of NM so some folks are happy to have any job.
bad,"If you are not in good with management, your life will be stressful in this environment. Go in, do your job and go home kinds of environment"
bad,"Had to work nights was locked in . I am a hard worker but what they wanted was not for me I had applied for a cashier position and ended up working nights, I was not suited for that job"
bad,Home Depot is a place you work when you need a part time to full time job to get by.  Home Depot is not a long term work environment for majority of employees.
bad,"The work is steady, however, management is subject to change.  Front-line mangers are circulated around various shifts.  A manager can spend six months working days and could then be assigned to work nights or vice-versa."
bad,"A typical day includes but not limited to helping customers no matter if you knew the area or not you pretty much have to figure it out."
bad,"I was hired as a full time employee even though I requested part time when I was being interviewed. I explained that I was in college and couldn't work as much as the other workers there. At the time the HR manager said that was fine. When I got hired I had no time for school, I stayed overnights, and I was on a full time schedule. When I tried fixing my situation the manager rolled her eyes at me and shrugged me to the side. I later found out that the HR manager was racist and because of that I was getting treated poorly."
bad,"Although the my coworkers were great, the job itself wasn't ideal, especially regarding the pay. The work vs pay ratio was bad, and career progression seemed out of reach. Perhaps a good first job."
bad,It is okay job to work for the management is terrible but if you want to know about Home Improvement it's a good place to work for but if you just getting out of school it may be at your for you the pay not good it was a bad experience for me
bad,Managers only care about themselves. Pay is poor. No discounts. They only give overtime when they need you to finish a project. This is not a good company to work for. Not enough room to grow.
bad,Do not work here unless you are in dire need of employment. They claim that they appreciate their employees but that is not reciprocated in managements actions.
bad,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment as i always had something to do. Job security is a big issue as just one customer complain can lead to an employee being terminated which was the case for me. "
bad,A lot of the tasks required in my postion were near impossible to acheive or not possible to acheive within the time frame management is the main problem
bad,They dont follow prodacall and don't care about their employees even though that is what they preach they push push push but are rude and dont support you
bad,"HD is a good company, but the division I was in (in home sales) had no respect for the sales force at all.  You had to be available 80 hours a week, and might have one lead.  You could also have 40 leads that made you drive 500 miles a week, only to find out when you get to the lead you can't offer what they asked for.  Commissions were good, but work/life balance was terrible. There was no room for advancement at all, if you were above entry level"
bad,What I enjoyed the most was working with people. The associates were like family. So that was the best part of the job. I enjoyed working with customers.
bad,"A typical day would be hard and constantly having to deal with an ignorant, uneducated boss. I stock shelves and clean products all day. Coworkers were friendly for the most part."
bad,No one like do things in there department no cleaning or organization  took place employee took breaks multiple thru out shift. Employees that wanted department to look good had pick up slack for rest workers
bad,"Home depot allowed me to learn more about inventory and receiving. Allowed me to learn different and new equipment such as forklifts, order pickers, and electric pallet jacks."
bad,"Good place to began a career if you have ambition to growth. The environment is not very just to hard worker, to many good worker with low salary in difficult position."
bad,"When I first started working there it was great. However, I have only been here for about 5 months, and it has steadily gotten worse. The management and overall morale there have worsened drastically. Helping customers is key to you success, but don't do so too much in the eyes of some or you'll be reprimanded for not working hard enough."
bad,"Each day different"
bad,"I would work in multiple departments so it all depends if I was in garden I would assist with mulch and etc. if millwork I would assist with doors, and in building materials I would really do almost everything to assist customer"
bad,Great place to work. Coworkers friendly and team oriented. All the managers were awesome to work under. Very safe place to work with safety number one.
bad,Trabajo practico y sencillo de entender todas las funciones a realizar
bad,"I liked my coworkers and even the managers there at the store level and the pay was decent for a part-time job, but that is where the benefits of working there stop.  I did not enjoy my time working there because of things that were done at the corporate level that even my store manager couldn't control. At one point, they had a major cut in everyone's hours when customers were already complaining that there weren't enough people in departments. Customers would yell or get mad at us for being understaffed when we had no control over it. Sometimes the customers themselves were unreasonable, but you find that at any customer service job. "
bad,"A day at Home Depot was was a quick paced environment.  I had no problems dealing with that.  I also got to meet some fine people during my work days.  I learned how to operate warehouse machinery and learned plenty about customer services.  Management was not very good.  There was plenty of down talking and backstabbing, especially managers pitted against associates.  Incidentally, that was the hardest part of the job.  The best part was meeting customers and helping them."
bad,"Relatively friendly place"
bad,"For the dedication that Home Depot expects, they do not compensate you for it. For a huge company, with BILLIONAIRE owners, starting salary at $10.00 an hour is a disgrace! "
bad,"Mediocre managers (a few really good ones), poor communications, terrible pay and benefits, more attention to what you do wrong that what you do right."
bad,It was a steady job. The hours were normally pretty nice but the work it entailed changed frequently and gave a feel of instability.  The relationship between the MET team and stores varied much and at times was strained.
bad,"They say they work with veterans but, I saw otherwise. Management plays favorites and they are not flexible or accommodating! They use you and lose you!"
bad,Lowest payscale for warehouse work around the area with no plans of changing this. No promotion within. Expected to be crossed trained in every part of the building with no extra pay. Long hours. Decent benefits.
bad,"I found myself in situations where i was able to make decisions on my own however i found myself being second guessed by some superiors while others trusted my opinion. Passed over for full time position, while having a competent career at The Home-Depot. Management spent a majority of time in meetings. Found myself needing management clearance that I was unable to get due to meetings. Was frequently understaffed on management."
bad,The pay was not satisfactory for such a physical job and worse. I had licenses for all the equipment and i didn't get a dime extra for it. I am using a forklift that can destroy property and harm someone and i get my base salary for it. The cashiers make as much as me and they do far less work.
bad,Working at home depot sucked people you work with talk about you behind your back and when you leave they still bug you by writing bad stuff on facebook .If you go to Stonebridge in saskatoon location don't go people they  are rude and one  head cashier is really rude and run you down behind your back.they like to stab you in the back so don't work there and when you get a lot of credit apps they don't care .
bad,"Four years on job workin at starting salary for new hires."
bad,"The new Supervisor started with 7 workers and now there's only 2. In only 3 months!"
bad,"I have been with the company  for four years and everytime I try to advance ,I am given a reason why I can t and Iam a  very hard worker and feel I derserve better .Management I doesn t communicate with each other very well .The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers come and ask for me knowing that I help them get their tasks done. The hardest part of my job are the very rude customers that come in and try to make you feel inferior"
bad,"Home depot was a really laboring job that made workers do a lot of heavy lifting and moving tolets or other heavy odjects sometimes you'll get a small project but most of the time it was something hard, or many hours of doing it."
bad,"the first home depot i worked at was good.  the second home depot was not so good.  my father was dying and i just could not keep my mind on work.  it was my fault, not theirs"
bad,You have to be able to handle fast paced in order to work there. At first it was a good place to work and after awhile it went the other way. They say open door policy however it’s not. Only if it’s good they want to hear it
bad,"In my store Assistant managers are lazy as it comes. They do not help, only work around looking pretty. They treat people like they are worthless. Home Depot as a company sucks. They are so greedy , they want to make 100,000 dollars a day with a little crew which affect costumer service."
bad,"the manager at the time didn't see eye to eye with me and through her fake smile I could feel nothing but ice, if I took tips I could have gotten fired, and I did take them because after two weeks I had almost half my paycheck, so what if a rich or successful contractor wanted to give me a 5,10 or $20 for rapidly loading 150 bags of mulch onto his trailer? I never asked for tips and never expected them but when I got them not only did it help my wallet it was a pick me up that gave me even more willingness to bust my hump and make sure I helped every single customer to the best of my ability even more so.  If your new there your just a body for them to order around on dated broken walkie talkies with them expecting you to more than you can and if your 45+ yrs old your expected to do almost nothing, so ya a great place if you like your youth being a disadvantage and you don't mind having to pass up over 150, 200 dollars of tips in the summer heat each week."
bad,"There is not a focused direction for employees. As a result, employees do what they think they should but are not driven by a focused target and this results in very low expectations."
bad,will literally hire anyone qualified or not. High turn over rate job can't keep good solid workers. Tons of employee's very few workers. Every man or women for themselves mentality. Just an overall negative work environment. everyone complains and talks behind each others back like kids. Management just shows up to collect a check really doesn't manage anything.
bad,Company is incredibly wasteful.  Doesn't follow it own rules pertaining to critical disposals practices.  Very low wages for entry level workers.  Advancement very difficult.
bad,Place used to be good years ago. Current management has left this place with poor morale for the last 3 years.. Bonuses were good but now we see a fraction of what we used to.  Voluntary ot is nice. Starting pay is ok but dont expect good raises as everyone is treated the same.
bad,"You were warned (unless you are the type of person who lives for maddening chaos)."
bad,"they dont pay enough nor do they give you hours, the way they pay you for unloading trucks is not right management does not commucation with each other."
bad,"Not that great of a place to work management is poor with communication throughout departments and hours are terrible. You get no discount but you get discount on outside things (sports games, dinner, movies..etc.)"
bad,management is the worst. claim to care about you and preach company values all day but you are just another number in a sea of orange and you will be replaced by the next robot the day after you are gone. its all about meeting their numbers and service quotas and managers getting that several thousand dollar bonus in their pockets at the end of the half when us sales associates who are doing all the work are lucky to get 150$ literally.
bad,"Bad management (Covington, tn) all other positions were good. Home depot is not a bad place to work, just need the proper management. It is a great part time job, they are willing to work around your full time schedule."
bad,Home Depot does not value the employees like they did back 2001. They company has change from being for their employees to all about money. The Core Value of home depot no longer lives. I will be resining from this company soon. It needs to go back to caring for the associates and the company. Now a days any one can become a manager. It is so sad how drastically this company and unfolded.
bad,"Not the best place to work. Managers are scatter brained and definitely don't train or help guide you to be successful. No one ever seems to be in their departments, especially when customers need assistance."
bad,I have been passed numerous times for a promotion.  However they are generally given to those who are either not in the organization or those that are less qualified.
bad,"I did returns for them. I would have to deal with the customers and, explain the reasons why some items were not able to be returned. I was left by myself most of the time."
bad,It is a typical retain chain.  Your hours vary from week to week. You job consists of helping the customers and having a small knowledge of most of the material in your department.
bad,"Although Home Depot was just a temporary position for me, it served it's purpose and I continue to work there parttime. I wouldn't refer anyone to Home Depot."
bad,"If you are not part of the In Crowd with Managers you treated poorly.  Some manager treated everyone Equal, But that was Rare.  Issue's of High Theft always a major concern with High Market up Items"
bad,the company was an ok company to work for it was just the location I was in management was totally unfair they expected you to snitch your way to the top
bad,It ok the worker there are ok some of them is real mean and some is good people I like working there cause the job I do is fun and I meet a lot of people and learn a lot also.
bad,It's a completely different company that originally cares about the associates and now only cares about the stockholders at Wall Street. It's an option if you have another income in the household and don't need benefits.
bad,"The Home Depot is a great place to work as far as benefits, as well as free money opportunities based on quarterly productivity. The hardest thing is the computer based training as it relates to the jobs  hands on, there is a disconnect ."
bad,When i first started i was excited to work there but as the years passed i noticed their raises were peanuts no matter how hard you work and they were so unorganized i just finally put my 2 week notice in and left.
bad,"Poor management and an unwillingness to change.  Too many people have been there for too long - there is the ""if it ain't broke"" mentality.  Ask the same question to 3 different people and you'll get 3 different answers.  The place is a mess."
bad,I have worked at The Home Depot on two separate occasions as a full time permanent employee and as a seasonal. While they have a good work culture it is not a secure job. They only have certain busy seasons and after that the work stops almost immediately. Temporary seasonal staff are laid off without warning or any kind of notice. I was wondering 60 hours a week and weekends in every department and I was told I would be hired on but that wasn't the case. The management is simply there to boost morale and can't figure out there jobs. So overall my experience there was a few months with a paycheck and that's all.
bad,"Working at the Home Depot is working under a stressful work environment with low pay. Its ideal if you are not college educated and need a job, but not so great if you want a better than average position with good pay. One cannot afford to support themselves or a family on a Home Depot position alone."
bad,"I worked at Home Depot 8 years ago. When I started it was a fun place to work. Managers were amazing, employees were awesome. When I went from working full time down to part time they only gave me 4hrs a week wasnt worth my time to drive to work."
bad,A fun place to work. I learned a lot about home improvement while working there. They have effective training sessions and really promote customer service
bad,"I am currently a cashier and some of the head cashiers are outrageous. Recently, I took a very important call while on the floor at the self checkout and got someone to cover me and the head cashiers yelled at me to get off the phone immediately. This escaladed to me talking to the assistant manager and is spiraling out of control. They don’t really care about your side of the story, they just care that they’re right in their heads. In the beginning, I absolutely loved working here and I looked foreword to each work day but I cannot stress the rudeness of the higher management here. Head cashiers are barely supervisors and let the power go to their heads. The home depot is a good place to work but probably in a different area than here."
bad,"Five years ago we had what I thought to be an engaged and caring manager who was fired for reason I can't explain after seeing the exact opposite for the last five years with the current management. Also home depot enlarged the size of my department by 4.5 more aisles, with no new associates to cover.I was set up to fail from the start of this."
bad,"It was good everyone worked together, when it got slow, I kept busy by keeping my area clean and orderly it was very slow, and it got slow, it was only seasonal"
bad,"The hours and pay was sadly below cost of living. The atmosphere within the staff was never a team one. Though they express it was, people were always discouraged by the lack of pay and yet the requirements placed upon them."
bad,Would expect me to pull a full deck's worth of building materials in 15 minutes.  Would consistently get stopped by customer's while pulling orders and the entire process would take longer than necessary.
bad,"Home Depot distribution starteed as a family employee friendly  employer.  Over the course of 9 years the distribution division became an ""up or out"" culture where individual managers were used up and disposed of."
bad,"don't really hassle you as long as you're doing your job, have some good team members, but management sucks, very nosie when it comes to your personal life if need to take a day off, they want to know what, when, where, how, and why......"
bad,"The experience that I had with Home Depot is nothing but bad because of the horrible treatment I received when I was working there. I didn't enjoy working there at all, i hated going to work when i was there."
bad,"All day on your feet hard work, which is all fine but not for the little pay and disrespect that you get from the management team.long hours, no over time allowed but still expected to work. Poor traing often understaffed and very little back up from management. The only positives were the ability to help people and had the opportunity to learn alot over many different subjects."
bad,If they got rid of a couple of the management Home Depot would be a good place to work. The Floor staff were really awesome to work with they made things fun. They the floors staff also cared how you were feeling.
bad,"The ""good ol boy"" mentality was active. The only upside was the health and vision insurance.  Management would promise rewards and then renig afterwards."
bad,"My time at Home Depot was on a part-time basis. However, ""part-time"" doesn't seem to mean the same thing at Home Depot as it does at other places. I either worked 30-35 hours a week or 8-10 hours a week, rarely did I ever work the 20 hour preferred work week (due to personal obligations). "
bad,The job was physical but it also had relaxed moments. I learned how building a house requires many different tools and materials. Also how much planning goes into each area of the projects.
bad,"Most of the associates there were very good I even got along with store management if I had a problem we could talk it out and they understood, and tried to help me"
bad,"Our management was changed drastically every 3 to 6 months. we never had a manager to really trust and depend on, only one to boss us around and not know our name even when it was clearly on our apron."
bad,The wages were not too low for the work involved. The atmosphere was friendly and the management for the most part was fair. There wasn't enough training and you had to learn as you went. Little opportunity for advancement unless someone quit or you transferred to another location.
bad,The culture in each location is different. Home Depot does not hire full time workers and generally will drum out those employees that are there too long/ make to much money. I would not recomend this job.
bad,"No night differential for night employees"
bad,when i worked at home depot i didnt have the best experience. it was during the time when our manager was getting fired so there was alot of changes but the people were nice.
bad,"Company is your typical retail store, in that it has poor management, not enough employees to meet customer service demands. Not many hours out of season. No chance for advancement."
bad,have not been in home depot long enough but i could use more hours so far I'm only scheduled for 25 hours for the entire month of February nobody can survive on that
bad,Management at this particular location was less than poor. They treated associates poorly and in some cases customers as well. They talk down about associates in front of fellow associates. They have inappropriate uncalled for comments and conversations. They do not give you a chance to explain yourself. They do not offer job security in fact they do the opposite.
bad,"lack of communication and lot of working in circles. the hard part of the job is that nobody knows who""s doing what. there is a lot of associates that just walk around and nothing happens to them."
bad,I liked working for The Home Depot it was something new for I was never a cashier before so that was nice. The only thing about the company the supervisor for the cashier was rude and played favorites it got to the point to where people would ask to switch jobs positions so they wouldn't have to be bother with her.
bad,"The Hours were all over the board which in turn was difficult for my family. Never sure of what the next week will end up being. Hard to make plans for daycare, meals, and homelife balance."
bad,"But when after I had been there for several years and asked for time off which was granted at the time I asked.  They then told me I was not aloud to take time off because I had not asked in advance and when I had, I had documentation of asking in advance."
bad,"You are expected to do a lot. You must have a team player attitude or you will not be able to handle the shortcomings with your work schedule, co-workers and management."
bad,They were strict and didn't care if personal matters came up. The days seemed long and boring. Sometimes they would make you move from the department you applied for to a whole new department because they were short staffed.
bad,It was a firs time job after i got back from basic and i really just needed a job so i took it i really wouldnt recommend it for anyone to work there.
bad,"I enjoyed working at home depot,but it was taking a physical affect on my body ,I never knew what shift I was working and could never have a set schedule to spend with my family."
bad,"As a cashier I am responsible for my area. This includes straightening the candy, drinks, or other merchandise near by. The rules about things change just about every other week. Management is not in agreement about important things but not the unimportant things."
bad,"organise the storage and distribution of goods. In this role you will ensure that the right products are delivered to the right location on time and at a good cost. You may also be involved in transportation, stock control, warehousing and monitoring the flow of goods."
bad,"Incompetent management at all levels."
bad,"deal with customer issues, the hardest part of the job is dealing with cluless mgmt. and training dept supervisors who do not know the dept they are assigned to or have the qualifications. if you are young and mgmt. likes you , you get promoted."
bad,"This job was very easy and fun, perfect for a summer job. The responsibilities were to restock all the magazines, books, and new merchandise for select stores."
bad,"Managers are really facilitators of company dogma and are not allowed to make executive decisions when it comes to being compassionate or understanding. Corporate is out of touch as most recently evidenced with their deafening silence regarding the movement to bonus workers and raise salaries due to the recent changes in tax law, but they think employees are super excited that corporate is spending that money on ""job tools"" to ""help us do better at selling"" and increasing share-holder value. Give me a break. the CEO,CFO and the other executives are so out of touch with their days off and executive perks in their Ivory tower that they don't realize that the best incentive and the best recognition is the kind that an employee can put in their pocket. Instead, they give cra_py fun fund money to the stores to pay for lou_sy Wal-Mart lunches and the Christmas party where they raffle off a few gifts....A majority of the employees get a dinner and Home Depot marketing gar_bage. Until they replace Corporate bonuses with fun fund money, don't expect any changes at the Depot with respect to financially compensating employees."
bad,i was in millwork sales and it is very cut throat you have a sales quata to meet and it is hard to make your goal every week. its also the department no one wants and you get stuck coving everyone elses department at night i would have 5 departments to cover almost half the store
bad,"Everyone I worked with at Home Depot was drama. Poor Management, poor team. Everyone had it out for each other. The only good thing that came out of it was the hours and the shift I got to work."
bad,Local management did not care much about individual employees. Scheduling was a problem as associates would be scheduled to midnight and two days later scheduled to open at 5am.
bad,just a job not a career....pay stinks. unless you are favored you will never go farther than a worker bee. They did not care about individuals just about money
bad,Travailler serait plus agréable avec des bons bénéfices et un meilleur salaire.
bad,it's a good place to work as long as you are there to work and not goof off..... that's my whole take away from the position i had at the home depot store.
bad,"I was department manager over mill works. And also a fill in for contractor sales manager. Made scheduled and took care of customers of all backgrounds, to doit yourselfers to contractors."
bad,I enjoy working there. I started out as a part time cashier and then promoted to full time head cashier. I closed the store every night that I worked. I secured all monies in store and setup for the next day
bad,"Poor management... very low pay... i worked there full time and it was not worth the money i was being paid for what i did there and the time i sacrificed to improve our department. just not worth it...."
bad,"typical,... hard workers dont get acknowleged and kiss ups get all the praise,....I loath this job because of the social standards that have been placed within a gender biased environment."
bad,Very poor upper management had good benefits but upper management treats there employee horrible didn't care if your family was sick ad need you or if you were sick wanted the company to be more important than family
bad,"Store manager lacks enthusiasm for guidance of employee advancement within the store. When I asked for her opinion in accelerating my advancement to full time status she replied ""I'd rather hire two part timer positions than hold onto one full time position."" "
bad,They hired me for one day in lawn and garden for a pay of 11 and hour. The they moved me to kitchen and bath and told me to tach myself Kithen design. Which i did rather quickly. Within a couple months I was a leading sales associate in the sales of kitchens. Other associates were being paid 16 and 17 dollars per hour. They refused to increase my pay since I was hired at 11. When the yearly review came up they gave me a maximun 3% raise.
bad,Very very low pay for all employees . A very fun and easy work environment  . Good uniforms . Friendly environment . Poor management underpaid management.
bad,"Home Depot has to be better at managing and paying better to employees with experience and bilingual."
bad,"Management is horrible, they do not care about what is going on in the store or about the customers. The supervisors are even worse because they do nothing all day when they are supposed to be working as well, they take advantage of their positions by taking breaks longer than they're supposed to and by taking 2 hour lunch breaks and management doesn't care unless it's a regular employee doing so, that's when they 'enforce' the rules."
bad,Good place to work. The people are nice and the customers are nicer. Great if you want to move around a lot. Easy to grow with company. Great to meet different people
bad,productive and a great enviorment it was  fast paced  experience for me in the time i spent with the home depot. also greeted the customers as they walked into the store. t
bad,"A typical day at my job would be waking up at 3 in the morning getting on the vans by 4 go to the home depot clock in grab your machine, stickies, and ladder."
bad,"Some of the easiest shifts you ever got at Home Depot turned out to be a nightmare just because management was in a bad mood, or the store manager suddenly got traded to the worst performing store in the district... meaning that you got THEIR store manager instead and the entire company's weight was put on your shoulders all at once."
bad,"Work hard for small amount of pay ,told me a lie, that I would up in rank quickly.Because of my status the hardest  part of my job was communication.It was all most 9 months  be for I got  evaluation,it was to be every 6 months"
bad,"Home Depot is a good job and they train there employees. I was trained  a cashier at Home Depot, and enjoyed working there. I left Home Depot to go to School."
bad,When I worked at Home Depot the management was poor at communicating and organizing their employees. The assistant manager at the time would be verbally abusive to employees.
bad,"As a whole I don't have all that many complaints about the company itself, other than customers are allowed to verbally abuse the associates. I did not feel safe mostly because of the customers. Being exposed to verbal abuse on a daily basis weighed heavily on my nerves. I feel the company could support their associates more where it comes to the abuse the customers bring in to the store."
bad,the co workers are nice and the job is pretty laid back unless you get stuck in lumber section or in the gardening section. everything is heavy lifting in those areas.
bad,"pull merchandise to the work area and restock the shelf's. do resets in all departments, change ads on products. wasn't a good work place. found myself working alone. the best part was getting off."
bad,new managers do not care about their employees new store manager does not work with peoples requests hated walking into every shift for last 6 months.
bad,"a typical day at work - problems, management - awfully, workplace culture - 0, the hardest part of the job - all , the most enjoyable part of the job - 0."
bad,"Children manage the departments under the direction of the ""warden"". Good place for retirees and kids. I would not ever work there again just because management and direction was non-existent."
bad,"they did not give much room for higher pay, advancement, or schedule change. Handling customers was as expected but handling management was difficult. If you didn't get them credit cards they treated you different, After a point we were understaffed and they continued to cut back peoples hours even full time employees, to the point i couldn't even afford to get to work."
bad,Management not supportive of medical issues or concerns related to staffing. Multiple conversations regarding being diabetic and needing time to check sugars were ignored.
bad,i worked with plant cleaning and watering them helping customers find plants and garden supplies.i learned how to communicate with customers and staff members.work place culture was modern the hardest part of work was the heat.the best was the experience bein there.
bad,"Not satisfied with the companies policies and procedures in respect to their work values, particularly their work ethics. It was not implemented on a daily basis."
bad,the people were fun and helpful to work with but the management was subpar.  A lot of responsibilities with a department phone and knowing what is in the department you're working in.
bad,"was not train to handle the questions from the conusmer, was left alone by my self a lot and there was a lot going on around me with any help,and did not know the product that well"
bad,"When I first started with the company, I enjoyed The Home Depot (even though I worked extremely hard overnight). Within the last 3-5 years, the company has made cut backs and changes within their standards and expectations. These changes have made many employees believe that he/she was acting less than ethical just for the sake of the perception of the management team and the ""bottom line"" of the store. I believe that there are still many good managers within the company. However, I also feel that it has become harder for those good individuals to stand up towards the overtaking management teams that are weeding out the advocates for the subordinates."
bad,"Just looking for a different company I didn't Feel a lot of accomplishment from all my efforts in this store ,  I learned a lot and had a lot of training/Schooling from Home Depot which I value and appreciate"
bad,This was by far the worst job experience I ever had...I love design and I loved shopping at this place.  Working here was a whole other experience. I take it as a positive experience because now I have an appreciation for what a really good work place is.
bad,"Home Depot expects caviar work ethic on a ramen noodle pay rate. Management has no interest in communicating with their employees and expect mind reading. hard work is not appreciated and despite putting forward my best work, it was never recognized."
bad,Would have stayed if the supervisor didn't hound me everyday. I didn't like the fact that my manager asked me to be on my feet from clock in to clock out with only 15 minute breaks. Other than that it was pretty laid back.
bad,Great company to work for. Company offers a lot of benefits and the management team is awesome for the most part. I had a lot of fun working for this company and learning new things
bad,"Home Depot is a great place to work but they don't pay very well. They also don't offer full time, and aren't on top of their hiring process. I didn't have a manager so it was hard to get time off or shift switches"
bad,good work culture and good management.  we can balance work and personal life.  good management.  top management is good enough and policies are nice.
bad,The place was good to work for  but the way they do your performance was really terrible and they need to adapt to other methods for the way the job performance is handled the atmosphere when the job starts is kiddie also
bad,"Longest job I ever had, thank God it's all over. "
bad,the average day at work was fast paced and you had to be ready for anything and be ready to do what ever you need to do to take care of customers and there problems
bad,"Punched a clock, Position was very micro-managed.  There was absolutely no room for advancement even though that was promised to lure me from my previous position."
bad,"Everyday was filled with stress, when I would arrive to my shift there would already be a line at returns and angry customers at the customer service desk. Managers would ask you to do unreasonable tasks while dealing with said customers since there was staff shortages in other departments. Certain situations would require us to contact associates from another department to inspect a returned item or for a question, only to get no response from them. Unfortunately it is not the stores fault that they are short staffed, since the store is staffed based on a point system instead of sales profit."
bad,Fast paced on some days. Customers are rude. Management is a pushover. Everyone thinks they can be in charge. Hardest part is the customers. Most enjoyable is when customers are kind.
bad,it could have been better. I did not like the treatment in some ways. The management was not the best. There was not many associates to help with work.
bad,They refused to make me full time so they wouldn't have to pay for insurance while the one or two people that got full time never showed up to work and I had to work for them anyways.
bad,Not fun to work for. Very hard and wear out your body and you are just a number to them. Also they what you to work 65 job but want it done in 40 hour week.
bad,Working here was very demanding and there is no work/home life balance. Mandatory 10 hr shifts plus every other Saturday. Management seemed to not really care.
bad,MAnagers are a joke. People only care about saving their own butts and will walk over others to advance in the company. had the WORST work experiences there for 4 years. Only stayed because a few of my co workers were great people and had made many friends
bad,"A typical day with Home Depot was answering inquiries from customers."
bad,Training is poor. Enviornment is challenging because you are expected to know everything about the department you work in on the sales floor. Co worker lack team effort and assistance.
bad,"District manager and manager made the rules up as they went along.  Favoritism ran ramp it.  Transferred to get rid of managers, went out the way to fire all the employees with tenure.  Successfully be the way"
bad,"While i enjoyed the position and people i worked with,  This particular location lacked due to poor management,  Things were not done in an efficient and fair manor,"
bad,"stocking and sales making sure all the spots are filled.keeping customers happy.setting up carpet measures."
bad,While working here I have learned numerous ways of customer service. There were trying times but working for this company wasn't bad at all. The hours were flexible the pay was ok
bad,"The Home Depot associates was rude, one day I was working on the truck. one of the employees had his hand on the line  was moving and his hand had gotten ran over. then he went to the truck and cursed at me and my coworker whos also working the truck with me. Couple other associates  would always make homosexual joke which made me feel uncomfortable."
bad,This place only cares about making money.  not about the employees that they pretend to love....management cares about there own advancement and do thier best to cover up the poor management of those of whom have a established amount of time with the company.  even if they don't know what they are doing or are blatantly a poor people supervisor
bad,Management didn't know what they were doing and made it difficult for the rest of us to do our job. Hours were never what they told you they would be.  They would always ask you to stay for overtime.
bad,"took as a layover job to stay active. spent a lot of time shopping there"
bad,"When they train you, and offer you the job, it's many promises, of career advancement, cross-training opportunities, fun/relaxing culture, a place where the value of safety, and opinions of all staff is taken seriously, and considered."
bad,"The freight manager at the time was great however most of the other management picked favorites when it came to certain people who had worked there for more than the rest, regardless of how hard they worked."
bad,"At first the job was good but after a while management started rocking the boat started changing schedules changing departments throughout the store, bad"
bad,"I originally went to Home Depot to go into management, but found out rather quickly that they do not want, nor appreciate people that know more than their managerial staff. Assertiveness, and those that speak their minds is not something that this company tolerates. If you are not a ""yes"" person, your chances of advancing are nil. Management is paid well, seemingly for doing relatively nothing. There is a novel's worth of things to be said, but suffice it to say, if you are a sheep that takes commands and asks no questions, you'll make it to the top in no time!"
bad,I had a terrible experience here with a particularly terrible individual who was actually fired after my employment there. Apparently he's that terrible.
bad,Servicing 103 stores daily when they contact me regarding their feedback on the deliveries my facility ships to them. And most of all providing them with AWESOME customer service.
bad,It was an ok experience. Nothing to really boast about. It was a job. I met some people great people that I could network with. Ive had better experiences.
bad,"nothing to add, I learned what I had to learn. I just find that people who work there has no ambition at all, very disappointing to notice that type of behavior but I blame that to big corporations new mentality towards employees."
bad,"Theres not much to say except its retail. sometimes its a good day. But the management is horrible, no one takes responsibilities for their actions, they will change your schedule at the last minute, but sometimes its a fun place."
bad,Schedule not flexible.Work very hard and dirty. Very heavy lifting required. No bathroom breaks. Had to work outside in over 100 degree weather. No support.
bad,I learned that it was all about favoritism. It wasn't about how knowledgeable or how reliable you were it was about how close you were to your store manager. The hardest part about leaving home depot was saying goodbye to great associates that worked for you.
bad,"Typical day at Home Depot consisted of, helping customers with questions and answers. restock and refill shelves while operating power equipment on a day to day basis."
bad,Employees are not all held to the same standards. Recognition is not given. No raises with promotions. Cut-throat environment. No on-site Human Resources.
bad,The store manager was really cool but when something happened and you tell them they don't take actions towards fixing the problem. it's like they have their preferences. if they don't like you they will do anything possible to get rid of you.
bad,"Not a great place to work, very stressful , inconsistent work schedule , transferring within store departments discouraged, too much emphasis placed on computer based training and not near enough on real life on the floor training with experienced people."
bad,"Job is simple the difficulty is working with the other people employed there either they non talkative,lazy or rude or they will attempt to be friend you only to stab you in the back in some way."
bad,"Corporate pressure, no appreciation, meager pay. Nights, weekends, holidays. lots of expectations, but will get thrown under the bus by management. cannot agree on corporate policy. decisions by managers are contradictory and self serving."
bad,The worst part about Home Depot is the varying hours. They will get you divorced in the long run. You can work overnight to an opening shift then closing all within 3 days. Hard to sleep and have a family life.
bad,"It was a waste of my time really regret spending a week their let alone almost 4 years. the establishment is a joke. think high school nonsense. if you are friends with so and so then maybe you get pushed up the corporate ladder. In my time their i went through two store managers, 7asms 4 of them were fired, and 3 ops managers is it a surprise? no, and the reason for this is because they are not qualified to do the job."
bad,The management there did not conduct there selfs properly. New nothing about the deptartments that the were to be operating. Had clicks as management you showld not be in clicks.
bad,"It sucks, benefits are way overpriced, hours are rough, management is awful. Basically if ur lazy and good at bullshitting management youll do fine but if you actually try and work hard and want to get ahead and have bills to pay they are going to use you until you cant take it anymore."
bad,It was to hard to keep money till accurate.  Other workers had access so at the end of the day there would be times that till was not accurate and would get blamed for it
bad,"The environment is fun to be around as the love to show appreciation to there reps by feeding them and having fun games, but the opportunity for growth is slim to none. It seems they shoe favoritism rather than going by the specific processes they have set forth to obtain promotions or higher positions. Even though a call center often changes, they do not give the necessary communication and time frame to advise of these changes and thing are often sprung on the reps at the last minute."
bad,i worked full time hours while being compinsaed with part time hours. also was promised advancement positions but were never given these. the overall experience was negative. but as always i went above and beyond before quitting
bad,"Boring , get very dirty while at work, just a job to get money in an emergency should think of more of a future but good house equipment & managers are kind"
bad,"I absolutely loved the customers.  However, I feel I was under-paid for the work I performed.  Simply time to move on.  Also, there was a measureable level of internal disorganization."
bad,"I get that politics in the workplace is common practically everywhere but, politics at Home Depot was so unethical and so prevalent. There were so many followers and people were willing to do anything to keep their jobs even if they had to do something wrong in order to show loyalty to management."
bad,One should work retail at least once in their life so that you can witness how poorly mankind treats each other. The Home Depot has trained customers that is okay to act like a 3 year in order to get their way regardless weather or not they are in the right.
bad,Cut hours depending on the department. Management needs improvement;hardy understandable and tough again employees. No communication. But the people there are amazing.
bad,No help from management when you need it. Does not pay enough for the job you do. Too much is expected of the employees. Stores are not staffed well enough putting all employees in position to have to cover multiple areas.
bad,"always had to stay outside even when it was hot outside, a little uptight at times, management was okay but could improve on their skills at times wouldn't be the first place i would recommend"
bad,"A typical day at work would be me punching in. and receiving mayhem from customers because we are under staffed. hardest part is multitasking customers and help train new associates. training is awful, your thrown in with the wolves. the part I like the most is the associates your co-workers are pretty cool when there not stressed."
bad,"this is the worst job i ever had , i work 8pm till 4am  very dusty cant breath very well i have acute asthma from this job a lot of ppl sleep in the break room during there shift  night manager doesnt care they dont hire full time employees the hour suck 20 5 hour a week ,no wonder this company is losing business revenue is down every month!!"
bad,"Depending on which department you work, the day can be very stressful or very relaxed.  Unfortunately, I learned that managers may not be consistent, fair, or communicative when dealing with employees; but I also learned that I enjoyed the interaction with the public. Store managers vary in their handling of store staff.  One manager may be very involved in insuring employees are trained properly, others are not.  The stress level in a department is completely controlled by the ability of the department head to communicate with employees.  The workplace culture is one of comradery among hourly employees.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with other departmental employees who would not carry their load when working.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help customers, and learning different tasks in different departments."
bad,Its a great place to grow and take off on a good career start. but it depends on the store you work in and if the managers are all for helping you grow.
bad,a typical day at work-fast paced long  what you learned-how to perform job management-  Needs training relating to associates and customers. Workplace culture-civil. The hardest part of the job- Dealing with non paying customers. The most enjoyable part of the job- Having a relationship with great customers and associates.
bad,Very disorganized group of management everybody wants to be a manager and no one knows how to do it. Seems as though no one really cares they just try to shove their job off on someone else and knows that do care find a better job to go to.
bad,"The job as cashier was easy and manageable. The work environment was fun with my coworkers.You meet great people. The work environment could be rough at times, but usually your coworkers made it better."
bad,"I was promised at least 35 hours a week, and by mid-summer I was working a mere 20 hours at a low $11/hr. I work at the customer service desk and I am barraged by daily complaints. I can't work fast enough, even though I am multi-tasking with answering loud ringing phones, helping a customer complete a work order and taking returns. I can't take breaks at times! It's a dumb job, as we are expected to be robots more than people."
bad,"Though compensation wasn't all that great, the people were really good to work with. Other employees and management treated me well. Just wish I was paid better."
bad,"I was looking for part time work and was not wanting to work every weekend because I had other obligations, this was discussed during my interview.  The schedule was as discussed during training but once the honeymoon was over so were the required shifts.  I also found management very cliquish and did not hesitate to show who was their favourites.  The job itself however was fun and I really enjoyed the customers.  The training was decent as well."
bad,In order to really move up in this company you have to kiss up to others and get in the good sides of everyone. I dislike that reason because it should be based on skills you learned and how well you demonstrate them.
bad,i hated this job because it was very hard at times. the managers are very layed back and do not care about the rest of the employees which makes things very difficult
bad,"The Home Depot may have some tight-knit employees in some locations, but the stifling corporate Big Brother is unavoidable. A typical day is just jumping through various hoops and little else. Not recommended as a career path."
bad,I did enjoy working at Home Depot. The feeling you get when working at Home Depot is a family feeling. I always liked working there just need to make more money.
bad,"You don't have chance of moving up on the MET team, they hire from the street and make them supervisors of employees that have worked for  The Home Depot for years, instead of promoting from within. This is not the way to do it and then expect the employees to respect that person."
bad,"Sales is never easy.  There is always something that changes the regular pattern of each day. For older staff, it is difficult to handle the needs of loading materials"
bad,I was in transition from jobs - This was just a cool down period until I decided what I wanted to do next.  The people were great but I was often asked to work over my shift due to lack of people showing up for work
bad,"Drama runs rampant around the building, overworked and understaffed 90% of the time. I learned several departments but get into trouble any time I help those departments."
bad,Not a suitable place for all to work.  Harassment. Discrimination harassment is allowed.Favoritism is rampant. Low life individuals are allowed to harass hard working people. Not a good place to work.  Pervert at the pro desk.
bad,I found that management of the territory was poor as an example I had an appt with a customer that was scheduled to see 2 consultants the same day on related product we did not get either job due to the customer thinking we were not very organized
bad,"Was a sales consultant for HDE.  Was told the stores would provide all the leads I need, and that the average sales consultant made between 50k-70k per year if hitting expected targets.  Was told my job was to sell the product, then the install folks take over from that point."
bad,The job is easy to learn. If you don't mind working for minimum wage with people without career goals then this is the place for you. MET is a way station job. It'll get you off your feet but by all means not a place to stay and start a career.
bad,"Everyone's experience with this employer is different. Some love it and stay for 20+ years, some leave after their first week. Like any other job, you get out of it what you put into it."
bad,Not enough associates to help customers --sold Appliances -stressful work environment-- associate related issues not addressed by management-- bad atmosphere-
bad,"Specialize in servicing brakes and fuel systems."
bad,"As a Branch Service Coordinator, it is expected to be treated by customers in a manner that borderlines a hostile environment.    The motive is to make the customer happy, no matter what the cost to the employee or their moral .    Thick skin does not even come close to what you have to deal with.  For the close to minimum wage salary you are offered with no bonus to speak of, it is clearly a choice of whether you enjoy getting accused of things that are beyond your control."
bad,Working at The Home Depot was personally for me something temporary. The pay was not much but the benefits were some of the best. It was full time so that was good.
bad,Great environment and work place. Nice place to learn from. Great customers. Really enjoyed being there and learned about how it is to be an employee there.
bad,"Management doesn't care about you, they won't teach you anything and you get in trouble for not knowing it. Have to have open weekends or else schedule doesn't get approved"
bad,"my brother in law was my boss, he was a real jerk to work for, stocking shelves, watering plants, cashiering, walking around from 2 to 4 couldnt do any freight"
bad,The work becomes very redundant and mundane after a while as you do the same checkout process for hours on end. The hours are plenty during the summer season but very little during winter. Full Weekend availability was mandatory.
bad,The way this place is run isn't good.  You can get in trouble for things that shouldn't be an issue and they have very poor management so the store is a mess.  Management belittles their employees and they do not work to make them better or help employees out at all.  It is not the most friendly place to work.
bad,"A poor place to work generally. They tend to not care about their customers or employees from my experience there. Going above and beyond was not even recognized, let alone rewarded."
bad,"I worked there for about two years the job of cashier was very easy no unnecessary difficulties but the management staff didn't manage the staff very will, witch caused a lot of frustration and made a lot of people quite. it was so bad they had to bring in new management since I worked there."
bad,"While I genuinely enjoy customer service, like most retail positions, a majority of the job is stocking shelves. We have customers from multiple cultural backgrounds in the store every day, and communication can be a challenge, but a fun one. "
bad,"Each day (in my experience) you get stuck by yourself during fast business times because somebody didn't schedule another associate. Management is a heaping mess. Store manager is extremely biased. The hardest part about working at the home depot is being treated extremely poorly by the customers and not being paid enough to deal with customers constantly cursing and yelling at you. The most enjoyable part of my job was to leave. Most of the associates are nice people, while the rest are out to create drama. I learned at The Home Depot that management never cares to hear the associates side of an issue and will force you to resign with no prior write-ups or warnings, or discussions with the associate involved in the issue."
bad,"Do not work for Home Depot. The company hires tonnes of part-timers to avoid giving any full-time benefits. Hours are sporadic and often, management provides ""busy work"" to keep up appearances."
bad,"The job itself was easy, but there is absolutely no job/life balance. The culture and the people seem to be down most the time and the management teams dont seem to try to help their own employees."
bad,There were only a few management that knew what to do and understood what to do. Those few listened to the employees and tried to help head management were to worried about what they need then others.
bad,"Flexible hours which made it easy to work around my school schedule. However, they cut hours unless you are part of the inner circle. It's like high school all over."
bad,really love operating a forklift but management team sucks and micro manage workers that don't need it. Pay sucks and no recognition. Home Depot is a dead end job
bad,"My experience at The Home Depot wasn't amazing. "
bad,I learned no matter how hard I worked and no matter how dedicated I was.... I can be replaced. If the company wants to get rid of you they will find a reason.
bad,its a pretty easy job if you can stand for overnights. the people that work there are cool its just management that has a hard time communicating with its employees effectively
bad,"Prepare to work hard and lift heavy. Depending on where you are posted, you may be overwhelmed by customers, heavy lifting, and ghosting from management. It's not the same in all branches though."
bad,"If you are looking for a part time job to get by, I would say Home Depot is not a bad place to work for. They are drama at times but as long as you keep to yourself you will be okay."
bad,"Not impressed with the depot at all. they do not recognize a good employee when they have one. they are cooperate.It is all about the bottom line, not helpful employees."
bad,"The associates at Home Depot are great. Good management, however, is lacking at this store. There are a ton of job opportunities at the store in many different departments. Would recommend if you are just needing a brief job until you can find another."
bad,In the beginning Home Depot is a good place to work. But when trying to advance within the store it is not about your work ethic but about who you know and how much butt you are willing to kiss to get what you.  They do not treat their associates well enough for what they ask of them.
bad,I was able to cross train in almost every dept.  management was good but would leave you thinking you were getting more out of what you do.  I was told I would be promoted but after 6 mths of waiting and seeing others move into those rolls I lost hope with that endeavor.  I loved working with people helping customers and meeting new people is what I enjoy
bad,Everything about the company is about making it look good in the disguise of customer service. The training is minimal and they put unqualified people in front of customers for projects that could cost the consumer a lot of money if done incorrectly. They hire too many inexperienced people at low wages to give the impression of being there for the the customer rather than hiring more qualified at a higher wage for real service.
bad,"Completed reports, learned how to do different home projects, DIY projects. Provided answers to customers on how to complete projects, what to use and how much materials needed. Provided customers with special orders and deliveries on products not typically sold in the store. Management and supervisors tend to show favoritism. There is a lack of appreciation. I did enjoy most of the staff and customers."
bad,"In the year I have been with Home Depot, my job has been threatened, my hours have been cut, and my guaranteed raise was pushed back three months. My coworkers, not management or department heads, are incredible, we are a family. But once you add the department heads and management, the company ruins itself. Management is selfish. I don't recommend working here."
bad,Worst management. If you bang the boss you get paid more and move up the home depot ladder. Horrible horrible horrible. maybe other home depots are better but store 6557 is not
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and also enjoyed the word I did. "
bad,"It is a typical hourly job with few benefits and no real long term prospects for the majority of workers.  It beats a blank but is in no way comparable to a real job with benefits, pension, medical coverage etc."
bad,Good place to work with the exception of bosses of the particular department i was working for. they made it hard for me to return to work after an injury.  made it uncomfortable
bad,"I worked at the call center, it was a great and comfortable environment. The center included a café and gym. They also provided an area outside to sit and have lunch."
bad,I like working for the first home depot store in AZ.  Great people that could appreciate a hard working a dedicated employee. After transferring to a different store in a different state all only after 4 months mind you.  The new store was a different story.  Still stuck it out for another 8 month before resigning due to stagnation.
bad,I did not enjoy working here because of management as well as the employees I worked with. They are not very understanding and the benefits are not that great.
bad,"Help answer customer's questions regarding electrical supplies."
bad,"I have been with the company now going on for a collective of two years. The labor part is fair for a job of that caliber, however it is the constant shifting of management that I cannot recommend this company for. Management puts you where your talents will be utilized most rather if you seek to be there or not. My current work condition is that of hours being depleted. This comes after attempting to move up and to two possible positions, yet it is not the one they had in mind. As of this week, since I did not take their offer for a position that I did not seek to move towards, hours are being cut. This is not good business practice nor is it the team focus the company says to stand for. People will shift positions naturally, but as it stands currently, if you do not go where they want you to go, you will not have much other choice but to seek other employment elsewhere."
bad,"The pay was okay, but for a billion dollar company that expects you to go above and beyond for them its not worth it. Its on okay place to work part/full time, but if you find something better you should go for it."
bad,I say that they were not caring because I had asthma problem and I was having a asthma attack and they let be drive myself home. I have hear about other employees there that gain health problems there and they fired them.
bad,while employed here you will obtain lots of knowledge of the products Home Depot sells.  You are expected to greet customers and assist customer with their purchasing needs.  You sometime have to explain the products to the customers and how it will benefits them.
bad,"Loved helping customers and working with associates."
bad,"Under appreciated employees, high turn out, and poor management. Part time job that got me through college, and was overused. Strict rules on requesting time off."
bad,would work 8+ with as little as a 15 minute lunch but no breaks and you can forget about appreciation or bathroom breaks. most of the co-workers were fun and easy tom work with. Great training was provided
bad,"As a large company one would think certain aspects of smaller corporations would be gone such as personnel preferences. If you get along with the leadership in the store great, otherwise you are on your way out. Certain associates get away with murder while others cannot do anything right, they have a ""wheel of values"" that only seems like they uphold when it is convenient to them. Unfortunate that such a good company to work for still has so many issues that need to be worked out."
bad,Its a good place to work .but there are some improvement they can do for the employees. the management dose not give value to their best employee there is no difference between an employee who work hard and help a lot for  company growth and an employee who dose not car about the company .
bad,"When I worked here in the summer of 2013 there was a lot of issues in the management here. For example we always had a shortage of people working and for the few people working their shifts a ton of work got dumped on them. I got yelled at several times for not getting a job done as fast as they wanted which was impossible due to limited workforce. As for myself I never missed work, always showed up on time, and always made sure my area was clean and stocked up before I left so when I said what I said it becomes even more clear how bad it was. So far I have heard the management has changed several times since I worked there so this management problem may not exist anymore."
bad,"Have been in retail many years, worked years ago. Came back to it, Pay is severely decreased. As a sales person they abuse you and pay you a salary you can not live on. Very Sad how the management are so cruel, selfish and down right mean.."
bad,"we would stock shelves with merchandise and cover down to help other employees when done. But when others were done they would not help. The hours were extremely rough, and scheduling was horrible."
bad,you spend your day doing customer service it will help do your job if you have some kind of knowledge of the products you sell the hardest part of the job will be the customers that does not want to wait they will butt in. You will have to acknowledge them and make them feel that they are first.
bad,A great place to learn a lot of different aspects of business as a new college graduate!  I was originally part of a privately held company that Home Depot purchased and the integration process was a great way to learn a lot of things that I otherwise would not have been exposed to.
bad,"no room for advancement at that platform. retail company so worked most holidays. good company, decent pay. outside work not desirable in winter time."
bad,"Working for THD was fine, sometimes it was even fun! But this was offset by the way supervisors and management would treat lower employees. Double standards and hypocrisy is a daily occurrence from certain supervisors and most upper management could either: care less, or not have any authority to do anything about it. That being said, notice I said ""certain supervisors"" and ""most managers"". Some were great to work with and their fairness and level-headed temperament made work a joy. But unfortunately those people don't  work every single day."
bad,home depot gave a lot of hype as far as the profit sharing program went back in those days . the only people who really profited were the one's when Depots initially started. examples were given that some people in the New Haven Depots became millionaires. what they didn't tell the potential employees thereafter that going forward what those people had accomplished would never be seen again.
bad,Great work crew that is hindered by a terrible upper management and policies. It is a fun and exciting job until you have to get a manager involved with a customer or complaint.
bad,"I don't want to give a review quit asking me, it is a fine company to work at during college. Their human resources is horrible their are no standards to be promoted and only people that brownnose get promoted and then they just forget how to function."
bad,working hours changed weekly so it was next to impossible to plan for anything long term. Otherwise the working environment was fair.
bad,Working here at this store wasn't a good place for me after a couple of years. I needed to leave because I was in a car accident and I needed time to heal as where they couldn't work with me or help me.
bad,Management does not live The Home Depot Core values they claim too. They are quick to write people up because the system flags you but want check cameras to insure the write up is correct.
bad,The store that I worked at the staff wasnt very friendly and they didnt really care about there employees. I had good hours but the pay and the number of days were not worth the money I was barely making enough to fill up my car every two weeks
bad,"Where guidance and potential for advancement/better pay may have been lacking from management, they do tend to hire  great people with a team-player attitude. Usually fast-paced."
bad,"Management tends to favor or look out for themselves, pressures on sales,however we need to take care of the customer and get things done right the first time before any sale is made,so the sales may not always come as quickly as they would like.....I'm sure it's not like that everywhere but it has been like that even when management has changed over, .....there is a lack of compensation,and communication throughout, ......taking a position over and not given the tools you need to really succeed in that position I've seen many employees fall because of the lack of training or poor management,....."
bad,The compensation is poor . The fact that there is no commission is a great setback . The opportunity for advancement is rare . There are many miserable employees.
bad,A typical day was focused on looking for customers and helping them find the products to fix and complete their projects.
bad,"This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc."
bad,"Interesting work place with many friendly team mates as well as customers who sometimes, just want some one to talk to. One gets to know these folks and often times true lasting bonds are forged."
bad,i made a whole 45 cent raise the last year i worked at home depot. right after that i was promoted to hardware dept manager but since i received my annual raise of .45 cents i did not get a raise for the promotion. thank you home depot
bad,"CAD design training for kitchen installations."
bad,"Seeking room for growth, no growth potential in my current store, I love and passionate about the work I do and my abilities to perform my job above and beyond what's expected of me."
bad,"good place to work. Positive setting, great benefits, good people and management. I enjoy working and learnign new things to enhance my skills and abilities."
bad,"Love all my coworker, That why I'm still there. I  asked ten of my coworker are they  happy to be working here all said no. It's management. They say that there is a  open  door  policy. It's not. Management can make you or break  you."
bad,"Hardly no hours and the co workers are ok and management was"
bad,Anyone there can tell you not to make this a career because the things that happen in that store can only be explained if you've worked there.
bad,"it was a very long day there, management were full of themselves, treated employees like garbage and were disrespectful. also they make you do their work if they dont like you, 6 people quit in the three months i worked there"
bad,Not too enjoyable. Low pay. Good if you don't care to really go far in a career or move up in life. The only way to get a raise is to pretty much become management.
bad,"Night shift can be tiring on most people and can be a little difficult to adjust to.  The management is in Atlanta and many of the workers in the larger data center are here in Austin.  There is little communication between the employees there and things tend to pop up out of nowhere.  half the time the job is demanding but not entirely stressful but there should be a better communication between the employers and the employees.  That would make for a far better working environment, and more efficient work."
bad,"I will never submit a Doctors note to keep a job when I'm not able to go to work for being overweight; although it did give me some experience for the drama involved in a sit down job, and how to avoid it and to be more weight conscience."
bad,"Homedepot is a good company . Putting  stock in the over head. Talking empty boxes. Taking boxes to receiving "
bad,"The job itself is not too bad and the manager are not the best but they are good at what they do. Your hours can get cut but they will do what they can to improve them. You sort of get the chance to pick your own wage but has long as you have long experience of working in sales. But they do not increase your wage that much and you get arise once a year, you basically have to relied on profit sharing which I find is a joke for the company to not pay you more money and everyone seems to be convince that it is the best thing but its not which means you have to hit target each day that you are here. Be aware of lot of change when you come to work here."
bad,"Pull processed freight from inbound drop zone lanes and prep it to be sent out to its store location."
bad,"Middle management. That's the shortcoming of ""THD"". There are so many levels of management, just in the store itself, and most of them are there to coerce more labor out of an understaffed facility rather than provide leadership and support for those actually serving the consumers."
bad,it's great for a second job but not the main life sustaining career. short hours and not enough of a wage. No much else to say about home depot. Its a great place to buy
bad,"fun place with great co-workers"
bad,was not  a fan of working here people do what they what and complain constantly. some supervisors don't follow the policies.
bad,"It was a good 1st job great experience, I've met new people everyday! Great learning experience! I loved being a cashier because, us cashier's helped out a lot of customers out,"
bad,i was not happy with my job at home depot my experience was not a good one i worked to hard and recognition was never given maybe because of my age. the pay was not good as well.
bad,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants"
bad,there all related there and its alot of favoritism towards the group of managers and employee. Everyone there was dating each other the store manager constantly was on vacation so there no one to complain to about anything.
bad,"I arrive at work 10 minutes early. I have never been late for work.  I call the head cashier and ask where they want me to go.  They tell me what register to go to. Then I log into my register, set up my area, and I make sure I count up the money and have enough in the register so I can proceed with transactions with customers. I also make sure if I have the correct denomination of bills. I make sure I have a clean work area.  I make sure that everything is well stocked i.e. bags.  I make sure there are tubes for the money. When the money gets up to $1,000, I have to put the money in a tube & it shoots to the top of the building to the main office. I sweep, clean and dump trash & dust.  If people don't want the merchandise they bring up to my register, I put it in a bucket and later on put it back on the shelf.  The hardest part of the job is the customers that are having a bad day. I try to cheer them up the best that I can. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
bad,They need to treat their part-time employees better so they will want to stay. Need better pay and more holidays off. No compensation for working less than six months during their annual payout party.
bad,"Cleaning tools, keeping track of fleet, describing how to operate tools, creating contracts through a computer, and hard work."
bad,a high paced job with no organization with members of management always taking the job and working there own way instead of like a team
bad,"When I started this job, I thought it was going to be a very nice place to work but the more I started to work, the more I realized that the supervisor and even the manager doesn't really care about the employee. Favoritism"
bad,"I used to work part-time cashier. But after a year of working there i was promoted to work for PRO cashier. That meant that i had to be there Monday-Friday Opening hours which were 5 AM till 2PM. I really enjoyed working there because it was always so busy, and all the customers that i would help were there almost everyday. So i knew how to talk to them or what they were already in for, because they would buy the same items all the time. My co-workers were awesome, it felt like my customers were my co-workers as well too. The hardest part of the job was memorizing all the bar codes for like the wood and lumber products."
bad,I would say my work experience here was very knowledgeable and productive. The hardest part of my job was trying to learn all the departments of the store and general knowledge of each one.
bad,"I have observed over the last several years disturbing changes in Home Depot management and associate treatment. Turnover is higher than I have ever seen and management does not seem capable of filling empty slots. The work environment is becoming increasingly hostile and pay raises are practically non-existent. All this flies in the face of consistently beating sales of the previous year, every year."
bad,"While working there, most of the managers left. So, there was many moments of chaos behind the scenes and very few new hires."
bad,Great benefits but if there is no work then you go home. Never OT It's hard work but the pay is good if you can stay a full day. But the environment is great.
bad,its boring they give no opportunity to move up they hire mainly from the outside boring and boring boring boring boring.
bad,"The Home Depot is a bottom dollar employer in the Reno area.  The quality of associates is on average very poor, however this leads to any competent employee being pushed into a management position quickly which can be a good resume builder.  It is a good place to get practical experience operating equipment but every other aspect is a very typical retail job.  Associates have routines specific to their department which change very little, but are often pulled to other departments when coverage is short leading to very chaotic stressful days where your attention is frequently shifting from task to task."
bad,"Not much fun when you are a suspect and management is watching everything you do.  The requirement of a head cashier is to work with cashiers,training and assisting as necessary.  However, don't plan on taking a break during your shift, if you are not busy management will find you something to do.  They do owe you a lunch, because it is the law, and if it wasn't you would not get that either."
bad,Their management and way of training needs improvement. The hardest part of the job is standing on the concrete floors.
bad,"Very few people in management were decent. Too many wanted to delegate management level issues to low level floor associates. Always cutting hours, never enough coverage, treatment was terrible, promised things for meeting certain goals, those were never fulfilled. Mediocre when it came to climbing the management ladder, actually wound up skipping reviews and not giving correct raises. People did not stick around long. Our turnover rate was terribly high."
bad,Home Depot gives you 30 different things to do and does not give you the time to do it. a lot of demand on you and your family.
bad,"overall working for home depot, wasn't the greatest job, I realized while working there that the people who worked there longer than I did, there was favoritism , when it came to who got lunch break first or shifts."
bad,"as a team we start with our steches then we start our job, what i learn from this job is working as team to get the job done neatly and fast by the end of the night. The management for this job was not all that great."
bad,"Most of my cashier colleagues like their job here ( Decatur store ) but some had to request transfers or quit their jobs. The problem is not so much what you do day by day, it's the head cashier that is on duty at times. This guy has already receive numerous complaints in writing or people calling the corporate number to complain. He's only a head cashier but acts like he founded Home Depot. He takes way to many smoke breaks all over the place but gets on your case if you need to take a break. Most us don't like working with this guy. If you like the find out the hard way apply for a position and find out..."
bad,I enjoyed working for Home Depot but the higher ups and sales associates were not that great. I enjoyed working with the customers and the flexible schedules.
bad,"I worked for them for 8 years in which time I went from $10 hourly to $12.36 hourly, in 8 years! Benefits are not bad but extremely expensive. Management leaves A LOT to be desired. Favoritism abounds, opportunities to move up are there if you know the right people or are willing to suck up to the right people. The work is physically demanding without much reward or recognition."
bad,They place got real cheap after they got a new CEO. Benefits went down. Plus all they do is back stab you and the others employees just find things to talk about you.
bad,like working with customers to solve any issues they have. most co-workers are willing to help if needed.  teaching about tools and wood working.
bad,The company makes great commercials but is not organized and treats employees horribly.  The training program is ok.  The hours and work schedule makes it hard to have a home life or take college courses.  Too much turnover.
bad,"A lot of work for some without the compensation. No motivation or incentive to work harder, even when you try. A lot of miscommunication between different managers. One person will tell you you can't do something and another will tell you it's fine, and it's up to you to act according to which ever manager is present."
bad,Home Depot used to be a very great company to work for. Over the past 9 years it has gone down hill tremendously. Lose of revenue and firings of several well trained employees that had been there for years has hurt there company immensely. Management lacks the ability to be leaders or even communicate properly.
bad,"Being able to get to work, be productive ,feel safe with all personal ,enjoy your job get home safe ,know you earned your good wage."
bad,"Good position at pro desk, long hours, not very good pay for responsibility, used to handle customer issues, needed to appease customers at all cost"
bad,"Employees are under paid, especially the MET travel team from what I researched. The team travels from store to store and does numerous resets but only gets paid $9.50 for the work that's done. When choosing the company, it's best to work else where and this job be temporary. Its truly a job for those who have retired and want a little extra money. A single person nor single parent can live off working at the Home Depot. Its definitely the typical job of America, where hard work doesnt get you far but knowing someone does. If you're an opportunist and lack in hard work;  the Home Depot is a place for you."
bad,I enjoyed working here because I was completely clueless when it came to tools. Working here helped me learn the difference between a wrench and a ratchet. This is a great seasonal job.
bad,Training given by old school home depot is great. New training programs all through the computer and teach nothing. you only learn hands on. Overall its a good company to get started. If you want to move up and get promoted its about politics and games.
bad,Management not accommodating to the needs of the employees so don't look forward to the needs of the consumer to be met. Favoritism occurs regularly.
bad,it was only part time and imposible to get full time at that time so had to get a full time job I could not live on 20 hours a week
bad,"Majority of employees only help themselves and not other departments, management had their favors that would get away with doing nothing"
bad,push carts and clean up trash to maintain clean front entrance of store help customers load cars and find items in and outside the store
bad,"Trying to go extra mile in seeing that the customer is personally taken care of and satisfied,  Duties in typical day would be watering, display, selling, making sure isles are clear and presentible, and attending to merchandise. Coworkers are great.  Multitasking is hardest part of job while trying please everyone.The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people."
bad,I like the people I work with but the management could use a little help. They don't pay well. The benefits are very poor also.
bad,"- Typical day involves usually covering your department by yourself."
bad,"The department I work in, they are biased in how they promote.  Seems as friends promote friends only.  I have many Homer Awards and Top Performance reviews, but I never get select for other positions I qualify for. My department does unfair hiring.  Jobs are not posted.  They are assigned to others, then called a ""Lateral Movement.""  This is wrong.  Also, if management does something wrong, but they need that manager, they will not fire that manager."
bad,to be honest at the end of the day home depot don't care about you as an employee (you can always be replaced) customers always right even when they dead wrong
bad,"Associate for 4 years- started part time moved to full after 2.  "
bad,"they are not fir they have pets where they can have as must time off"
bad,"For the most part working at Home Depot isn't too bad. The demands put upon the employees is far greater than the compensation given. It is more a sign of the times that coorperations take advantage of the poor economy to pay people less than they are worth; and far to often hire people at part time to avoid providing  any benefits. I really wonder how the people at the top can sleep at night knowing that the people they hire are'nt making a living wage. Oh, I forgot; we are only numbers to them, not people."
bad,"There was a time where Home Depot was a great place to sign up for in employment but that has past since about 10 years ago. I have personally worked for Home Depot for over 4 years and a typical day consists of consistent clean up, grown adults waiting to be baby-sitted, and most of these individuals were honestly twice my age with at minimum double the time in the company. I learned that I should shop at lowes as well as how much better the employment is there after comparing factual differences. I worked my way up to a management position and I was literally told directly that I was screwed on my pay grade for the specific job I was granted. Many managers are paid very highly and literally do nothing but collect a pay check. Co-workers are without any doubt there for themselves and do not care for their peers nor their own associates. Most only care for making themselves look good for raises and promotion and do not know the idea of team work. The hardest part of the job is obviously dealing with the poor management and associates who just do not want to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the actual job. I did in fact enjoy the work I met lots of great people and customers. I loved helping customers out with their issues which was a fun daily challenge. I liked the machines, training others on the machines, and learning many new things everyday about home improvement and products."
bad,Enjoyed working for the company but the management at the time said one thing but their actions showed a different philosophy
bad,I didn't like working at this job the management was the worst. they don't know how to treat pregnant women i worked 8 hour shifts and only got a 30 minute break and i was pregnant. i would never work here again.
bad,basic shoplifting and cashier training. each store has there own unique style it depends on the leadership style of the manager. Holidays in retail speak for themselves
bad,"Even though they want to ""become the number one customer service retailer"", they are only about making money.  This location, there were HORRIBLE managers........Also, the other associates yell at customers and such, because there is never any supervisors and managers around."
bad,"Overall, the People make it a great place to work. Home depot places a lot of emphasis on training to make sure their associates can deliver exceptional service. If only they would realize that offering only part time hours on an irregular shedule, for a wage that leaves most struggling to just survive, should be considered criminal.   Pay should be Minimum $12.50 for general employees, and $15 to $18 for specialty/ consultation departments. ALL part time should be offered minimum 24 hours per week, before additional staff are hired. The company is greedy."
bad,"Home Depot seriously expects you to work 6 to 7 days a week, 12  plus hours a day.  IF you are willing to put this in week in week out then you MAY be able to make a decent living.  BUT all mistakes come out of YOUR pocket.....  Straight commission, no reimbursement FOR ANYTHING!!!  Gas, mail, travel, fax, it is all expected as THEY will tell you you can make $100 - $125,000 plus a year, and SHOULD be proud to pay for all of the incidentals.  Management does not care a whiff  for you - you are simply a live body out there running appointments.  Oh and they will throw you out running with little to no training because management is so BUSY and does not have time to train correctly.  No skin off their backs, because what ever YOU mess up - you don't get paid for.  But the company will either cancel the job or get more from customer in order to get to speck.  "
bad,"Watering plants, ordering plants."
bad,"After making schedules for my employees, I would walk my departments to see if there are any areas that may need some attention, either unsafe or unclean. I would make work list for each employee. I would also work with to assist and ensure the task were done.I always showed those above and below me with respect. The most tough part about my job was counseling those who didn't comply with work list or expectations of either myself or the company. The best part comes in 2 parts. #1. Becoming a close team of co-workers #2. Being able to reward those who go above and beyond."
bad,"just feel like there was no growth in company."
bad,The opportunity to be able to satisfied customer's needs.  Being empowered to take care of a customer to the point that it was not expected to go up and above to fix their problem and have the situation fixed for their benefit.
bad,Great Company lots of learning oppurtunities and expericene available however management team is a bit immature and unrealiable. fast paced work enivorment
bad,"Home Depot starting pay is decent compared to other retail stores, other associates are friendly and helpful. Every now and then there's a free meal for the employees or a sports activity to get involved in. However, if you are an sales associate and learn another skill such as a licensed fork lift driver or to be a backup cashier- you do not get compensated with a pay increase."
bad,"HOME DEPOT"
bad,"Home Depot is a fast paced, Very demanding employer. The potential for job advancement seems to depend on, Knowing the right person. Not knowing your product, Your store ops or job in general."
bad,"Very chaotic work environment"
bad,Good place for entry level management experience. Difficult hours for anyone with a family. Very political at the district level. You must learn how to tell them what the want to hear which is usually not the way it is. Stores are severely under staffed especially when needing to improve profits. The managers will frequently receive a call from your district staff directing them to cut a large portion of the help for the week in order to save expense. Then the managers are expected to maintain world class customer service. Seems that new CEO is reverting back away from taking care of his people.
bad,When working for this company I would advise you to know someone that is in upper management. With The Home Depot I found that they showed favoritism toward individuals who had been working for the company since it was in Baton Rouge. While I do understand the fact that you would want a seasoned professional in leadership positions it is of a great disadvantage when those individuals lack the seasoning they claim to be looking for.
bad,"Put on the orange apron and focus on learning how NOT to care. Outstanding customer service is the mantra of the Cult of Orange but you quickly learn that what you really need to do is spread yourself so thin that no customer can have your full attention and no task can be completed without multiple interruptions. Try to walk from the back of the store to the front without encountering lost and desperate customers looking for guidance from sales associates who are not there because... wait for it... the sales don't support the payroll. That's right! There is no coverage in the store because sales for that period don't warrant the payroll hours so there are no associates to sell anything so nothing gets sold! Crazy how that happens! You will be absolutely hounded with notion that it is a big family whose members support each other and you will experience absolutely nothing of the sort. Very few full-time positions and the pay is base. Veterans with over 15 years of time in have second jobs. Want to move up to junior management? Prepare to be sacrificed when you are set up for failure.The hardest part of the job is the utter lack of corporate support. Providing the lowest grade of customer service and paying out ""compensation"" to those who have learned the game is degrading and totally unsatisfying. Prepare to Not Care."
bad,Not a good place to work. Won't work there again. Not for everybody. Archaic systems and processes. Huge layoffs at times.
bad,A lot of good people worked with me while I was there. Management wasn't the best but what do you expect from retail. Poor scheduling didn't help ant either.
bad,A place where you can learn about home improvement and helping customers with there needs be prepared to work with lumber and out in the heat or cold
bad,"Home depot could have been more professional, from the interview to the first day of work they were all off their game. When i first arrived for an interview they didn't know i had one and no one even showed up for the interview so i had to reschedule one. Then after everything was said and done and i started my first day they were very unorganized and cluttered throughout the store. No one knew who was supposed to be training me or who my supervisor was. Overall i had a bad experience with them let alone the hours of employment or hourly pay."
bad,"Work with outdated equipment, constant cost cutting measures utilized in daily functions so as to increase profitability. This is at the expense of employees and customers alike. Also very acute awareness of PC employment policies and adherence to fulfilling quotas as best practice yields a demoralized work force. I love the home improvement industry but not the constant emphasis on being all things to all people. Also the concept of lean manufacturing practice is being applied as an overarching theme to the daily staffing of the store, to everyone's detriment. This is the theory that we do 10% more with 10% less, until homeostasis is achieved, as perfected by Toyota. Also the hourly workers hours are severely restricted  to keep them at part-time status so as not to pay benefits. Raises and COLA's are kept low to boost managements bottom line and to ensure that end of year profitability and bonuses are high."
bad,"Running a cash register, taking care of customers needs and wants. Really good managers."
bad,Sold merchandise outside and in the garden also help costumers answer questions and select right product in these department.
bad,"Alright if you just want a steady Job not very good at taking care of their employers overall it just a hourly Job"
bad,"I stuck with this job for two months, but had to leave because it was negatively affecting my health. They also gave their seasonal hires confusing timelines for working there, telling us any combination of overtime available, no overtime available, part-time and full-time, maybe or maybe not being hired full-time (which is understandable, as that is dependent on work effort). Towards the end of my time there, I was responsible for 5 aisles by myself, which was certainly not right for me, but the overnight supervisor didn't really care."
bad,"A typical day as a cashier at Home Depot includes ringing up customers and zoning the area surrounding your register. Most days are slow. As with any retail job, the main thing learned working here is customer service. Cashiers come into direct contact with customers more than any other associate in retail. Management is fairly decent. Although, they do have a tendency to prefer certain people over others. Personally, I didn't care for that. Co-workers are about the same as they are anywhere. Some you get along with, others you have to tolerate. The most enjoyable part of this job was working in the garden center."
bad,"My day were very stressful. I must be honest regarding the management team, The A.S.M'S   were not on the same page. The store I worked in continuously changing store mangers. Therefor the communication with all store staff was completely disorganized, causing the store not to meet monthly sales plan. With the exception of Tool Rental. The department I managed, I stayed on monthly budget, weekly sales plan, and provided outstanding customer service. I enjoyed working as a team with my staff.."
bad,Terrible employer. They keep people that don't know anything but release workers that are dedicated and willing to learn and expand.
bad,poor management skills on a daily bases. lack work skills by employees and no one cares long as quotas are met. management shows favoritism to curtain employees.
bad,"travail dans cette société était une très bonne expérience, mais n'a pas contribué à mon épanouissement professionnel"
bad,Good job great benefits teaches you a lot about home improvement and selling items in the store. your standing up on your feet all day.
bad,"Terrible management, they do not know how treat their employees they give you false promise to make you work and then turn you down afterward"
bad,"I usually open the paint department at 6:00 am. Typical procedures are to get paint machines ready for the day, this includes cleaning the different parts of the machine and filling the tint canisters. If not in paint I work one of four different departments."
bad,A typical day at the location I am employed is horrible. The customers are probably the worst in the whole nation. They are messy and inconsiderate. The hardest part of the job is the horrible scheduling. Management does not take care of the employees unless you are buddies with them. They worry more about covering their rears instead of thinking about employee morale. The only enjoyable part of the job is leaving.
bad,If not in management you are just there to fill a part-time role. No real benefits being part-time and hours get cut out of the blue.
bad,"I worked for home depot for three years. I liked it at first. There were designed shifts to cover the work load and the customer heavy volume. Then a year in to the job we got a new store manager, and things fell apart. suddenly the labor force fell, and associates we now having difficulty getting workloads done, but we worked real hard to keep customers happy. The following two years I tried my hardest to advance, my peers thought I would be an excellent leader, but management passed me up twice for unqualified women, because the area supervisor was trying to make a name for herself, things only got worse as more departments started to fail do to poor management, and lacking labor force. But on a good note, even the worst customers there were more pleasurable to work with than the leadership-turned-wal mart."
bad,Work hard with a handful of others while the majority of the employees just cruise and brown nose. It was rewarding to help customers with there home improvement needs and the relationships developed with regular customers. Some of the other employees were good people who I enjoyed working with.
bad,"Typical large corporation.   Quality of workers is less important than quantity or workers.  Good ""first job"" or for high school students.   Wages low for skilled employees."
bad,It is a decent job but I do not get to apply my exercise physiology knowledge. The best part of the job is helping the customer find what they need.
bad,"Wasnt flexable, got written up over every little thing. poor management. Old manager for fired for stealing/illegal use of markdowns. =/"
bad,Home Depot treats there employees unfair and nothing is consistent with the company and they only hirer part-time and they make you work outside in the bad weather.
bad,"terrible hours"
bad,"Took long time to advance. Upper management is totally disconnected with people in stores. Worked under a manager who regularly threatened to fire people. Not a good work environment in that particular store. District Manager wasn't much better. Several store managers let go or ""retired"" even with many years in at the company. "
bad,"Big box store ethic's. $10 an hour and no experience. But if your young and need a job, you can get one there. WHY TELL YOU MORE, THERE IS NO MORE TO TELL YOU"
bad,I was working as a cashier so honestly I was confined to just the cashier station. The people were nice to work with and you were able to put in for when you need off in the computer. I kept getting splinters from the wood and my back would hurt from moving the heavy stuff around in the cart. They pay minimum wage.
bad,"Llegar por la mañana o según corresponda tu horario checar detalles con tu jefe(a) de depto recuperar tienda acomodo de mercancía nueva atender siempre al cliente hasta satisfacer al 100 su necesidad, la dirección y gerencia es buena pues son muy apegadas a los principios de la tienda el ambiente es bueno con el personal restante aveces es difícil pues el cliente es muy especial y difícil de satisfacer"
bad,"Too many phony leads made by in store lead generators. They were required to generate a certain number of leads."
bad,jobs was ok but cant work around school schudle and kids. you feel like you never move up when your part time if was like you had no life and ou time for work would be all over the place. for some one who has no kids to take care of this would be the job.
bad,"I learned so much while I worked at Home Depot. From product knowledge, computer skills, phone skills, and customer service in general. The most enjoyable thing about the job was some of the wonderful people I met there. I can say I will take some life long friendships away from there."
bad,"Worked the front end as a cashier, also worked garden as a cashier. Not a great experience. Management and co-workers were not friendly at all, felt that they were unapproachable. Hardest part was the hours."
bad,"agreements were made to accommodate my diabetes that were never really followed throw on.  It was an ongoing battle the whole time I worked for the company.  It was not just me, it was many others also.  There was a large amount of double standards and favoritism.  Employees were never taken seriously and often blown off. The most enjoyable part of the job the other employees, I would not have stayed as long as I did if it was not for them.  Management was very unprofessional the entire time I worked there.  And I was dismissed for sticking up for myself.  I do not recommend working for this company.  Poor scheduling procedures.  Poor training of supervisors.  Learned a lot about hardware products, mainly self taught or learned from other associates."
bad,I delivered excellent customer service. I worked at the service desk to assis with online orders and also worked outside in the garden area.
bad,Go to work and greet customers and co-workers.  Handle cash and maintain a clean work area. A positive and friendly attitude gets you a long way.
bad,It was a clean and easy going environment.  Most of everyone there was friendly. It was a overall pretty easy place to work.
bad,"The DC.in Pittston is where I worked,there were 8 people in my orientation class in witch 2of us were over 35 and the rest in their early 20's .they put the kids on forklifts and the older 2 working the conveyers.that just shows the hdp has no faith in the youth in this area...that place sucked to work at..but that's just me..."
bad,Its a commercial retailer what do you expect? Its degrading on a daily basis.
bad,"I love the people I work with, with one exception. We have a supervisor who sits on their behind and does absolutely nothing.  This supervisor has been reported and home depot hr seems to want to protect this person and keep this person at the expense of losing a whole department who works hard and has each others back.  Home depot treats us like this all in our imagination but we do not imagine this person doing call avoidance which is customer neglect, and not helping with the phones when we are busy and refusing supervisor calls."
bad,"Very busy. Enjoyed meeting customers."
bad,"I would start my day by clocking in then going to walk my part of the store to see if there was any customers that were not being helped. After that I would get on the computer database and see if there was any customers that needed to be called, Most of the time I worked alone which was difficult at times when there is 3-4 customers that need help. Management would never come over to lend a hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had more co-workers during busy times of the day."
bad,"Busy from the moment you get there, cleaning, down stocking, helping customers."
bad,they could use a little more fun in there job. they need to not be so uptight.
bad,I worked with a good team. I learned quite a bit about inventory and quality of products. I liked working with customers and helping them find what they were looking for. I did not like the management style of the company. They would change hours and either call you in or call you and tell you not to come to work that day because they were already over hours for the week.
bad,This job was perfect while I was in school but as I went on I noticed that it was a dead end job no room for advancement. This wasn't the job for me especially because of poor pay and benefits and very little hours it became very hard to provide for a family on that kina salary.
bad,"The key word is multi-tasking and how you represent yourself to your associates,customers and to your vendors. While resolving customer problems,management issues and of course contractors/vendor problems.  I have learned through experience that you can not take situations too seriously, you need to know when to laugh .When you are performing well, you are driven to do better."
bad,Was in charge of store safety and making sure that at any given time the customers and employees operated in a safe and secure environment in the store. I administered training to associates and supervisors concerning store security and shrink prevention. I also investigated fraudulent activities within the store and apprehended shoplifters and persecuted them.
bad,I worked for the pro desk for insurance during interim for better oportunities
bad,"Working at the Home Depot takes a lot of hard-work and a thick skin when you work for management that treats you like little kids, and only promotes the ones that don't question them or they are so new that they don't know any better"
bad,"I worked with USA military as a interpreter and translater ."
bad,"Managers are 24 hours 7 days a week ""home depot"", forget your outside life. You eat sleep and breath home depot. Which is not good."
bad,"This company is the worst, long hours with no growth in the company, I was the Final Inspector in a could not move up in this company becuase their was no other postions open. The mangament did not know what was going on in the company, you could ask them a question and they didn't know the answer."
bad,"70+ hrs a week is the norm."
bad,"The job itself is relativelly easy, but you get treated like you are a complete idiot alot. The management in the holbrook building is very poor. The day processing manager is really moody and very hard on people, he tends to overreact. He is also a complete hypocrate,and a real jerk. The general manager is very arogant but  not very smart, and does not treat people fairly. The head of security is very two-faced,he pretents to be friendly to get information from people he can later use against them. If you are thinking of working here, work in the ronkonkoma building.I think you you will be able to tolarate working here a lot better if you don't have to deal with these people."
bad,"A lot of pressure for little pay, management does not care about employment"
bad,"I thought working for this company I would have received good pay,  but you don't receive proper training and they expect you to know everything to help out the customers."
bad,"When I first started at The Home Depot I was very excited and looking forward to moving up in the company. I worked hard, took most of the online training to learn other departments. I worked in receiving,the service desk and the vault as well as a few of the departments from time to time. My job as a Head Cashier was okay but not where I wanted to stay. As the months went by I realized that the harder we worked the more they expected, When they cut hours the employees left to close had to multi task to the point of being stressed. I wasn't always able to focus on my assigned job duties because customers had to be taken care of. When I went to management I was told to give it a couple more months and I could get put on the floor as an associate and stay away from the front end. That never happened. I made mistakes due to distractions and in the end I was terminated.I feel like if the managers would have listened more I would still be working there now. The best thing a new employee can do when first hired is just do your job. Don't learn more because in the end they will use you. Even the old timers that had been there since the store opened were starting to leave because it was to much for them. I closed all the time because I knew the store and was a great asset to the customers."
bad,"I learned alot in home depot I put all my effort to lear new things,like mixing paint as a paint sale person.."
bad,"A typical day at homedepot  is semi-enjoyable you get to meet people and build good relationships with customers and co-workers now not customer in-counters are good. I learned how to give great customer service, how to operate  forklifts, reach trucks, and other lift equipment. My co-workers were fun good spirited people most work hard. The management isn't all that good though they can be very unprofessional. Hardest part of the job is bad management. Best part of the job is meeting people and getting all assignments done."
bad,"Was a lot of favoritism in the workplace. Promotions were unfair, unless you were in the in crowd. The good part was the friendly customers you see and talk to mainly everyday."
bad,very fast pace active job. customers are vey friendly.Supervisors can be unprofessional at time. management is dedicated to driving sale not to support in employee support services.
bad,"Operated cash register"
bad,Need to know a lot about a lot. Customers were friendly but sometimes the till systems crashed and management was flaky.
bad,"I went to customers homes and sold them Kitchen Refacing.  I was informed that the leads were much better than I found them to be.  I was told that I would only travel 30 miles from home, I traveled 65 miles and more."
bad,"My job experience at Home Depot was horrible. They start you out as part-time, which most places do, but it takes you so long to move up to anywhere in that place. I was what they call a ""Pro-Loader"". I was one of the guys that help you load your car or truck when you come in and buy wood or big items that you can't load by yourself. On some days, I would be the only person in that position and running around on the busiest days trying to get all the orders picked and loaded, along with trying to gather all the carts out of the parking lot. I was told that I was not ""Performing Up to Par"" because someone saw me standing under a tree trying to catch my breath because it was about 95 degrees outside. So needless to say, after that ""Review"" i did not try to perform my best anymore. I was busting my butt at that place and did not get any recognition for my hard work."
bad,"The wage paid at Home Depot is insulting considering how pro employee the company claims itself to be.  It might be the location, but the internal culture is very unprofessional and coworkers are disrespectful to each other and the customers.  The fact that employees are locked into low wage part time positions for at least the first year of their tenure with the company may be the reason for the lack of motivation."
bad,"Customer Engagement each and Everyday. Teaching new people that have been hired. Selling Plumbing, Hardware, Electrical, Tools, and all Home improvement supplies."
bad,"Typical day consisted of the following: Maintenance, Stocking, Customer Service, Received Inbound calls, Sit-Down Forklift Driver"
bad,"I've been working at Home Depot for just over three-and-a-half years now. Home Depot has given me confidence over the years as I have learned some selling skills that will stay with me for life."
bad,"I've definitely worked at worse places. The only thing that really bothered me was that I had no opportunity to advance or learn anything new. I was hired as a cashier, but I wanted to know more about the different departments. I was never allowed to. It also got a bit catty, working with so many women. It wasn't a terrible job though."
bad,A typical day at work included ensuring proper pricing and display of products. Frequent customer interaction; made sure to provide friendly and helpful customer service while executing important merchandising tasks.
bad,"Head management I feel Takes advantage of All and more season workers."
bad,I restock the store when needed. I also did customer service help customers find the right product for them.
bad,I loaded supplies into customers cars.  It was back breaking work but I learned the value of hard work.
bad,Working full time there I thought it was an alright place to work. Pay and benefits were better than what you usually get in retail. The downside is just it being retail- customers can be a giant pain and the erratic hours suck.
bad,Working in the mailroom I reviewed and sent out donation packets
bad,"*Please note before you read that this is a review of the Home Depot's Rapid Deployment Center not the typical Home Depot store.*"
bad,"Sometimes the lights go out while driving through 8 foot aisles on a forklift. Management considers employees more like numbers than people. Only a handful of actually qualified workers and we got dragged to every corner of the store to help and then chewed out because our work couldn't get done. I was supposed to specialize in lumber and building materials and spent 50% of my day loading vehicles, 20% running lift equipment for other departments, and 35% waiting for other people so that you could do their job for them. 2% of the time I was actually in my department working. 3% of my time I was getting asked why I wasn't done with my work and why I didn't spend more time helping other employees."
bad,"enjoyed providing customer service and the cash vault was challenging and time went by fast.  Lots of great things to learn daily on the floor and great co workers.  "
bad,"Not much room for advancement, small pay increases,"
bad,"Did ordering"
bad,I like how I get the opportunity to work with and get to know all the people i have. The downside is that it is a low-paying job with minimum hours; With the low hours comes a demand for flexibility on your work schedule.
bad,"Suck up to your supervisor if you want to get ahead here. Day starts at 4am and ends at 12:30. Half hour lunch, and God help you if you are ever late."
bad,"I am not a fan of the way home depot treats there employees. Not just the way they schedule but they always forgot about breaks and relieving you for going home. Made for a miserable long day. The co workers gossiped and were not very professional."
bad,"I work about six hours a day on the weekends, collect carts, load items into cars for customers, clean where ever needed, provide customer service. I learned how to measure and cut wood on the saws, and a lot of home improvement techniques. Management is decent, provides help and answers when needed, my co-workers are all friendly and helpful towards each other. The hardest part of my job is the demand to keep up with carts and help with loading alone. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the people I made friends with, and how much I learned from and experienced with from them."
bad,"clock in get right to my register, and help customers as needed. while working at the home deopt i have learned that you never know what someone is going through so always keep a smile not matter what!!!! Love my co- workers, most of them have been working there for a while, very knowledgeable, hardest apart part of the job was loading bags of dirt. the most enjoyable part of the job was know that i made a difference in someones life just by a smlie!!!!"
bad,"Daily customer communications, via phone, email and written correspondence.  Dealt mostly with grievances of contract completions with installations and responses to governed bodies of State and Federal Agencies.  The most enjoyable part about the position was seeing resolution of customer grievances.  Short-lived due to Corporate Restructuring in 2006."
bad,Its a great company until something starts happening with other co workers then you get put on a black list
bad,"Please understand, The Home Depot does not and will not consider your educational background for employment and promotions.  THD was a nice place to work while I finished my bachelors degree, got me nothing and no where within the organization.  Once hired, all managerial (salaried) options are removed from company career path website.  If hired as an associate the only chance for advancement relies on your relationship with store manger, if his/ her focus is a relationship with someone else, you will not be considered."
bad,"The best part of the job was helping the customers the worst part was dealing with insecure supervisors who were very""  clicky"" if you were not there friend you generaly had a lot of problems added to your job. Most of the workers were ok but a few had a real knack for getting rid of personal they thought were a threat to there advancement."
bad,Working at homedepot can take alot of your social life and family life. Only good thing is every one knows each other.
bad,"A very interesting job which combines odd problems, various solutions, and anxious customers. Customers expect you to know every detail of every product as well as the solution to their household problem, yet employees don't get enough scheduled time to learn the products in specific departments. Contractors want VIP service from associates. Management wants employees to sell membership discounts of services normal customers will find no benefit in."
bad,"I recently interviewed at the Lathrop, CA location assuming I was going in for full time work. They only hire part time, to avoid paying out benefits to the hard working associates that deserve it. They will staff up during peak season and will terminate or work the seasonals a day or two per week when it slows down. It is tough to get in. you cant even prove yourself because there are no production standards what so ever."
bad,Solve Customer's Issues/Complaints. Handling Collections. Assisting customer's needs. Increasing Sales.
bad,Management was not balanced. Shifts were monitored and there was not enough room to grow.
bad,"I would clock in go outside and clean the front of any trash, than i would go to the parking lot and pick up any shopping or lumber carts and take them back to their location. What i learned working there is you have to be respectful to everybody who shops and works there. You have to have patients and stay calm no matter how stressed you get from customers or your co-workers. Management wasn't great but if you had a problem they would help you with it. Some of my co-workers were great and some weren't. I made many friends while working there. They helped me out all the time. We looked out for one another. The hardest part about the job was working outside when it was hot, you had to go inside every minute before passing out from heat exhausting. The most enjoyable part was getting to hang out with your friends on breaks or spotting them inside when they had to put up lumber with a forklift. Those were the best times when you could hang out and talk and get away from the heat."
bad,"I have been at Home Depot for about 6 years, i've been a back-up department supervisor for 4 years, in three different departments. I have learned the ordering systems, inventory practices, department supervisor duties and responsibilties, and knowledge of 5 different departments, and have attained my business management degree. Although I have enough experience, knowledge, and drive management team has yet to promote or give me full time. They promoted a cashier with no experience in supervisory duties with inventory, product knowledge, or ordering capabilities, but was promoted because he was good friends with a supervisor that has it good with the store manager. In all, Home Depot is great for people attending school, but if your not willing to bend over backwards, and kiss some boots, and have a desire to work for a compnay that promotes for hardwork, then please do not waste your time, like I have. "
bad,great place would happily work there again. Thats it thanks!
bad,"Assist customers with online orders and follow up with deliverers."
bad,"Some really great coworkers but poor management. Huge lack of staff and overall support. The benefits were good but the pay wasnt great. There was no real pay scale, they seemed to start new employees at whatever they felt like. There's nothing more frustrating than training new temporary seasonal associates that are still in high school and dont take their job seriously while you know they were started at a higher wage than you currently make (and I was there for over 2 years). Managers don't seem to value the hard workers that they have. The work itself wasn't difficult but it was physically exhausting (probably due to the fact that there wasn't enough staff). I would have understood and probably stayed on if there was proper support from managers. Usually there was no one around when you needed them. Being swamped and getting yelled at by customers for being the only person in a department was the norm for days on the weekend. Also, there didn't seem to be any discipline for lazy associates, the work they didnt do would just fall onto the workers who actually cared about their job and nothing would be said about it by the managers, even after continuous complaints to HR by multiple associates. Don't waste your time, work for a company that will actually value your hard work. "
bad,Management is more worried about money than anything else. Avoid customer interaction and give employees poor hours. Sometimes they'll give you 13 hours a week and break them down into two or three days if they want. 
bad,Unloading and load trucks of merchandise...placing merchandise in their correct departments
bad,"Check customers out, stand there and wait for the next one. Do it in a timely manner. Focus on the customer. Have learned patience. Co-workers were pretty good. "
bad,"A typical day is engaging into my customer that i love dearly."
bad,"It was a nice place to work but there was minimal pay, There was also limited scheduled hours."
bad,"I love to meet new people and help them as much as i can"
bad,As a former employer ive noticed that if your not already a manager or department head there is NO advancement for reagular associates and also i was told by  management that there are NO full-time position avaliable in the company. Also you only recieve one raise a year and it comes after you anniversary date and after three years it was not more than 24 cents each year. 
bad,"A typical day at work would include driving to the nearest Home Depot and trying to generate leads for home improvement projects, entering my leads into a computer and setting up times for in-home presentations, running appointments and giving free estimates on home improvement projects, and closing the sale on home improvement projects.  I learned that working a job that is completely dictated by what you sell is not a job for me.  I would say that management did everything in their power to make our jobs easier.  My co-workers would instill their input and try and make my job easier.  The hardest part of the job was generating leads for home improvement projects.  Leads were the most important part of the position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was setting up at events and talking to people about home improvement projects."
bad,"In my 3 years here, I've come to notice that the management is the main reason for all employee problems. Their refusal to even bring you on full time, even though I've worked there for 3 years is astounding. The corporate management is a joke as well. They're led by former GE CEO's who ran that company into the ground. That should explain a lot."
bad,"I'm shocked at the positive reviews here. In my thirty-nine years in the work world, I've never encountered such a difficult company."
bad,"keeping busy good pace, always learning , fun working with the public"
bad,"Run ,Run fast. They care about one thing only$$$$$.For every kind word you will get 20 criticizms. Andd the pay ,especially considering the expectations sucks"
bad,Sort my orders.
bad,this could be a better company to work for if they would pay ther hourly workes better and give a better heath care packages. It seems that there trying to avoid paying for more health care by given less hours to thier employees.
bad,"great staff, poor management syle, sales were low due to local down slide in construction - poor job security"
bad,I greatly enjoy working with my customers - they come looking for me when they are in the store.
bad,"Although the job itself is fun, the management ruins it. The pay is awful, especially for women,and the raises (only once a year) are absolutely insulting."
bad,"The best thing I miss about home depot was the customers.I loved the co-workers that I worked with at night because we worked as a team,but that wasnt the case when I moved to day shift.The hardest part of the job was getting use to the schedule."
bad,"Boring nothing to do, employee favorites which is unfair. VERY poor pay! Dont care about your safety! this job is just to pay the bills for now!"
bad,"merchandising shelves, customer service"
bad,Work life balance wasn't there. Very little chance for advancement.
bad,"Home Depot is an alright company to work for. As a cashier, the individual is assigned to a cash register. The cashier will need to scan each item carefully to make sure no hidden items are not missed. If promoted to a different station, such as Returns Cashier, the Returns Cashier will need to acknowledge customers complaints about products not working properly. Based upon the Return Cashier's judgement about a defective product, the Return Cashier will need to provide summaries about the defective product to return to manufacturer. Sometimes Loss Prevention will keep you aware of individuals who are previous criminals. Promotions is not common; favoritism promotes the individual. If there is no lot attendants loading up customer's vehicles, the cashiers will work outside to load up customer's vehicles."
bad,"I enjoyed going to work. I got a chance to improve on my customer service skills and being a cashier. Most of my co-workers are fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people everyday. One of my strong points is customer service and I enjoyed doing it. Every job I had, had some form of customer service. I just enjoy working with people."
bad,Co-workers were easy to get along with. Management left something to be desired. The hours were ridiculous. Constantly looking over my shoulder regardless of how well I was performing my duties.
bad,Horrible hours with a bad salary. Nice employees. No room for promotions.
bad,Ever since working there i have learn a lot more an i have to say that its a good workplace more than others that i have encounter.
bad,"a typical day would be customer service number one, being in seasonal i had a lot of other tasks that other associates wouldnt, moving stones, keeping plants waterd, etc."
bad,"I was to special order products for clients. I worked in the paint department, floring, and mill work department."
bad,poor benefits and hours. lack of connection with the company and superiors. Can be a good learning experience in the short term
bad,"As a DC manager, had to deal with conflicting metrics use to measure your performance. Team concept doesn't exist, and they expect your full commitment without considering work/life balance."
bad,Managment is the worst! No one looks out for their fellow co-workers and rarely lend a hand.
bad,My days at work were very busy at times.
bad,Handing customers purchases and returns.
bad,"Fellow associates are great, a lot of hoopla about caring, balancing hours, training etc. Did feel empowered when it came to closing a sale."
bad,Home Depot's orientation includes alot of hype and fanfare to build up a strong morale and a positive attutude. One hits the floor running just to discover that it is all hogwash. Management does not hold to the supposed principals. So very much is expected from their employees for very poor pay. Negativity in on the floor prevails and it is quickly translated to poor morale. The end result is high turnover and cranky service.
bad,"This is a place to work if you are young and in school. Trying to balance your outside life on a fluctuating schedule is hard. But I enjoyed my co-workers, and especially the customers. Getting to know the customers by face and name was rewarding."
bad,"This job had a lot of promise. It turned into a complete mess. We were poorly trained, then tossed on the phone. The schedule changed daily, I mean every single day the hours were different. You had to change your alarm clock daily. You never knew when your off days were, usually not two off together. One day be at work at 9:45, the next 12 noon, the next, 10:30 etc. Then you would get silent emails telling you that your schedule had changed THAT VERY DAY. The break you just got back from? Well, it was changed to 15 minutes earlier. Now you are out of adherence. I was scheduled for a meeting from 5-6, so I put my phone in ""meeting"". Then at 5:45, I got an email saying that my meeting was cancelled and my ""new schedule"" now showed no meeting. Hey! I am already 45 minutes into the meeting that was scheduled before! These people DO NOT know how to schedule. There was no real meeting anyway. I guess it was just for appearances. You will have no life outside of this place. If you have kids (or a life), find something else."
bad,"A typical day at work included interacting with customers, ringing transactions on the register, processing returns, handling high call volumes, opening credit lines and helping customers locate and or place online orders for pick up. I learned how to process online orders and names and functions of merchandise. Management was not the best when it came to how they treat and interact with their employees, otherwise they are 100% customer satisfaction based. Not my ideal place to work when it came to co-workers, it was like being in high school all over again. The hardest part of the job had to be dealing with immature co-workers. the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with and interacting with customers."
bad,"I liked working at the home depot, love the ability to be different . Love paint and projects"
bad,Upper managerment was to pushy and never acknowledged you accomplishments. To many clicks according to a certain race there. Same people got awards when others never got recognized.
bad,"Though there is a lot of talk about being safe, bottom line is that Home Depot cares about $$. This drives up performance but also increases injury. In a 1 year period, I was injured twice and required 2 surgeries."
bad,"It depends on which area I am in on that day, Contractors area is high pace, Retuns is a normal stressing position dealing with customers that are in a bad dispotion, cashier in garden is the ability to remeber numbers and sales that are not in the register, most of my co-workers are freindly and do their jobs, about 15% of my co-workers are lazy and have a poor performance. The hardiest part of my job is dealing with situations that could be prevented with better communication. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people and solving issues that arise and giving back to the armed forces and veterans."
bad,Typical day at work is usually only a 4-6 hour shift most days and is usually busy with either assisting customers or stocking items.
bad,Morning meeting with SM. Request tills and set up registers for days sales. Check with managers for CO. Co workers were very friendly. Best part of the day was working with various departments to provide customers with the best possible shopping experience.
bad,"I loved my job, the satisfaction of helping clients bring their ideas to completion. But the biggest downfall, Work/ life balance. I feel that they should/could balance ones schedule to be consistent. I could never sign up for or volunteer anywhere as I never knew if I would be working."
bad,"Fast paced environment, no comment on the management team,co workers are moody, and tired. Hardest part of the job is an angry customer.most enjoyable is making someone happy!"
bad,Customers are generally happy to shop there
bad,"unfair, treats there co workers like there nothing. and when u want to open ur days to work to any they wont let u and when u want to change the days u can work they wont let u."
bad,"home depot paid good but their management wasnt that great, i learned better customer service while there and id go there work till 5 and get off work and go home"
bad,"The Home Depot was a good learning experience but has sacrificed customer service, training and employee satisfaction to increase their profit margins."
bad,"Great Company to work for but south corona store isnt the place to work at to much drama to many cliques. Managment does a good job but can improve. to be friends with other associates you must love to party drink and smoke it must be your first priority if you want to make friends there. If you chose a better life for yourself like going to school and doin other things that doesnt involve partying drinking ect they will not invite you to hang out with them, I am transferring to another store. Please avoid that store."
bad,"Okay place to work has it"" pros and cons.You can learn alot but only if you seek out the help yourself and be very deligent in doing so or else you will be lost some where in the mix.Management style perfer not to comment."
bad,"Terrible leadership , no real training just thrown to the wolves as i like to put it, allot of favoritism, I just had a terrible experience with them."
bad,I was a cashier in the garden department where I learned a great deal about plants and lawn care. I learned to run the cash register and how to obtain the correct pricing information.
bad,just a typical day its just customer service
bad,"Although providing me with essential skills needed to excel in future jobs, I would never openly recommend a retail job to something I cared for. It is the closest thing to paid slavery this world provides, second only to culinary retail."
bad,Home Depot was a good company to work for but now it is more concerned with keeping stockholders happy. Full time non supervisory job are virtually nonexistent. Part time workers receive little in the way of benefits and are expected to be on call in order to get any hours. After 10 years of full time status I moved and was forced to take a part time position where I was lucky to work 8 hours a week.
bad,While I worked there this company was good to me.
bad,the managment team there did not seem to care about the wants and needs to their empoyees. they seemed to be out for themselves
bad,the hardest part of this job is the shift in hours... The best thing about the job is the doing what i do on an everyday basis
bad,The work atmosphere is friendly. Camaraderie and friendliness is high. No one takes themselves too seriously. Change is generally accepted and improvements are common. Though it would seem that at times there not enough people to man the floor. Customer service culture and self-improvement is encouraged.
bad,"if you are an honest person, straight forward and down to earth it isnt appreciated like you would think. stay fake, lie a lot, have favoritism, be a favorite, kiss A%$, you will go very far in this company,"
bad,· Determined customers’ personal needs quickly and efficiently
bad,The management team at this store didn't know how to treat people.
bad,"My time at Home Depot taught me a few things about people and management who work for this company. They are all miserable and they don't understand the basic, essential functions of the work day."
bad,"The managers are horrible and never respond to any calls especially customer complaints. Secondly,the schedules are posted three weeks in advance so employees can plan their lives,however the managers will call you at home on your day off and expect you to come in because you have an open availability. They fire people and are really slow at replacing them, meanwhile you have to do the job of three people for the same pay."
bad,it was nice when i started working there because i loved my store manager and in the 5 years i was there the store went thru 4 more managers and at the end no one liked the store manager or the assistant managers. its like they shipped the managers there who would either make it or tank. it was not a friendly environment
bad,"I love working for home depot, and the people I worked with. Just upper management don't care for there workers"
bad,"Stay to yourself, share NOTHING about your life, keep your success to yourself, don't fratenize, either their going to realize your potential or not. You can"
bad,"management at the place I worked was horrible, they had their favorites and would often release their stress on cashiers. Do not get payed good enough for what they usually have to do."
bad,The work conditions could be better. The company should do more about associates being harassed. I like most of the associates there. Some customers are way to inappropriate with me and I’m only 17.
bad,"The Home Depot was a decent place to work because the job was pretty easy and the work was not too strenuous and the pay was nice. Although, the job was good the management needs some improvement."
bad,"In store generated leads (promised) were insufficient to sustain my household. Lafayette, LA is not a good market for these services for which I was hired."
bad,"Part time employees have unstable schedules change times and hours worked each week. Promised 30 hours a week some times don't get 10 hours! During slow times hours are less. I love the people I work with but employees are not treated equal in terms of hours and schedule compared to full timers. Hard to make any living off the job here."
bad,This is a good job for anyone looking to further their career outside of the company. The hourly associates are generally happy and create good relationships that are lasting.
bad,"People are put in situations that are either not suited or unskilled. This is a home building supply company, but the emphasis on home supplies took a secondary place to credit card sales."
bad,"The employees are underpaid compared to other companies of this size. Management doesn't communicate with each other or the employees well enough. Corporate only sees the green so they dont care to fix the flawed management, bad overstock and spotting regulations or the outdated computer systems."
bad,There is not enough space here to tell you how I feel.  They walk the walk but DO NOT talk the talk.  Wow.  I need to add 150 characters in this box.  If I did that we would be in big trouble.
bad,"right before i started here they switched from temp employees which drew alot of college students to permanent which drew more shift dependable employees. yet those who had been here before where still acting on what was once the problem. "
bad,As a lot attendant you would mostly be doing a lot of heavy lifting by yourself with no help for hours and you don't get paid enough for the job you would be doing and the management will make you work in all sorts of situations even if your not qualified.
bad,It's a good company if you are 25 and willing to work for min wage. They do not appreciate the wisdom and experience of an older worker. They tend to promote younger naive workers who will drink the orange coolaide and follow orders  with out question. Which is not what their founders wanted for the company.
bad,"The people that work here are good, caring, and hard working. But management is awful, and policy enforcement is sporadic at best. You're expected to work unsafely, often illegally, with the implied threat that if you complain you are fired. The training process is brief and ineffecient, and mainly relies on other workers to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, and they track your every mistake to fire you with the minute the season slows down. You will be made to work shifts without proper time in between, expected to bend to any customers wishes or abuse, and then pay for doing so later. There is a culture of suspicion too, and the upper management fosters tattling with rewards of job security, and they do not follow due process or good faith in that regard. It is a toxic place, with only the outfacing, customer involves people of any decency. The store is awful, and they do anything to make it look better, without changing anything substantial. They also insist on ""flexible hours"" even for full-time employees, and have no regard for availability; they want you tired and miserable so you'll either burn out and quit or be fired for stuff that wasn't your fault, and there is no recourse or hr involvement. The reason for this is unclear, but I worked here a year and at the start of every quarter they would fire everybody who was up for performance review and a potential raise. Until home depot is unionized and made to treat its employees like humans with lives and learning curves, stay the h**l away. At best this should be a job held for a few months while you're doing other things,"
bad,Helpful good job for beginners. Can get overwhelming when short staff. They teach you how to drive a forklift use a pallet jack. They also have a great program called to the homer fun to help associates in need.
bad,"The male workers there on third shift are very rude and they do not work, They weather talk and talk and talk and be on their phone was watching videos while you do all the work.They like to walk in on people while in the females restroom they will make you feel uncomfortable you have to watch out for them because that do not seem right to me in the third shift supervisor will try to make excuses for the mill workers which is unacceptable"
bad,If it weren't for my coworkers this job would have been the worst. They schedule employees the maximum hours without being full time. They  keep you in the position you started in.
bad,"The original owners are no longer involved, so although the values of the company haven't changed, the implementation of said values is dismal at best."
bad,I hate so much it suck there no way to move up in the company don't pay well for employee who bust there but everyday alll  they want you to do is work for free
bad,While I worked at Home Depot I had to balance training and floor time. There were multiple departments to train in and several machines that I could use that required certification. I worked in Paint and Garden departments regularly. The management was very caring and understanding however the customers were always very rude. Customer interactions would be very demeaning. There were opening shifts and closing shifts that I got to be apart of
bad,ASM Hiring Manager likes to play games with employee schedules with no consistency and enjoys cutting their work hours for income. Enjoys Playing Games with Grown Folks trying to work and earn a living for income.
bad,Home Depot has come with a culture of 20 percent of the people do all the work. Hired to many women and seniors who can’t do the physical work which then falls on the people who can.
bad,"Its not a fun place to work, very heavy lifting. You are required to do your job and meet quotes and call possible customers to feel your quota. You start each shift with warm up exercise, which is a great idea. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting 80lbs plus. The most enjoyable part of the job was the designing of customer flooring, giving the customer new ideas, not only in flooring but other projects they may have."
bad,"The work environment was nice, they hire very nice people so I got along with everyone, it was my first job and I have nothing but nice things to say about the company."
bad,"far to stressful and to much pressure. not Enough pay."
bad,I would not recommend that Home Depot Because it’s closed down but even when it was open the people were horrible customers were very horrible not friendly and got into a fist fight with one of the store managers. She hit me.
bad,"Everything seems great when you start working at the Home Depot call center. One you work for 3 years. No one really gives a heck on the work you do. If you try to move up the work place. They only hire people they like, it's not based on your job experience.  The stores are horrible, managers are rude and some of the people that work at the stores are racist."
bad,Just not the same as when I was Hired.  Culture is gone.  When I was first hires this was a fun place to be.  We had a family atmosphere.  Now there is none of that.
bad,I always want Ted to for Homedepot when I finally got to work there I found out there is a lot of favor tisom. The pay is not that good. I would not let my worst enemy work there.
bad,"High stress to make sales numbers. Focus more on numbers than customers "
bad,Well paid. Management isn’t strict enough. Barley have customers so work gets done quickly and then there is nothing to do for the rest of shift. Manager didn’t give enough work to do. Felt judged by other co workers.
bad,Worst job ever this job is only good if you really need the money you have too get on your knees to have good day at work if not they will do anything in they power to make your life miserable either by firing you or stress you out too quit
bad,"Working with fun people and serving customers by offering great products is a part of everyday life at The Home Depot.  Several opportunities to suggest improvements, receive recognition and learn about products for your home.  Learned so much from fellow associates how to use products to increase the value of my home which made changes easy."
bad,"I hated working there, it was one of the worst jobs i ever worked at. This is the type of job for a man, associates never come in and mangement is terrible."
bad,I loved the actual work I did. I thought the pay was fair and my co-workers were great. Although I ran into a lot of trouble with my schedule with the higher ups. Also A LOT of discrimination and turnover. Managers are terrible here but they never get fired!!
bad,"Management lacked in communication "
bad,"I was hired as part time working in the paint department. After one year I was offered department manager. For the next five years I pretty much ran and straighten out several departments including flooring, mill works, appliances and the night freight team. Once you get to department manager that’s when they really take advantage of you. Any ideas you have or suggestions seem to go on deaf years."
bad,"In the beginning, I was excited to work at Home Depot the employees were very welcoming. However, as time passed I was able to see how Home Depot really functions and was not pleased. The Management at the Cedar Hill Home Depot were terrible except 2. The tenure workers get away with anything, but new workers they are quick to get rid of. I would recommend any Home Depot, but Cedar Hill Home Depot"
bad,"There were many management changes during the 8 years I was employed. This lead to many times, the management wasn't on the same page."
bad,Was hired as a part-time employee with a 20 hour minimum Monday through Friday now it seems they are cutting hours and days can not rely on this job any longer for consistency.
bad,"Management sucks and retail sucks tbh. You could find a better work environment. The benefits and base pay are nothing to sneeze at though, especially for this work climate."
bad,I remember when I first started I was warned that that was the deparment only the strong could survive. I laughed at the idea but soon came to realize that it was no laughing manner. We were essantially in charge of every departments screw ups. While also being drowned in customer returns and issues. We had a dessignated spot at the desk for breakdowns. And for the whole year I was there I saw each one of my coworkers at the desk cry at least once. Even though we all adapted and grew a tough skin some customers were just unbelievable. Throughout all the years ive worked with customers the ones at this store were the worst. They're all so incredibly demanding even though you are trying your best to get their issue fixed. I enjoyed the people that I worked with very much. Because we had all gone through similar traumatising issues we tried to always help eachother out as much as we could but aometimes there would be one person handling up to 5 messed up orders at a time while trying to juggle everything else that was asked from us. It was really stressful.
bad,always busy very fast pace associates are very passionate and learned alot. Enjoyed managing and coaching teaching and training associates to help them continue to grow in there roles.
bad,"It’s way to stressful. Management doesn’t communicate, and not knowledgeable enough to lead. They expect way too much from employees and make yo their own rules and regulations."
bad,"The harder you work, the more they put on you. I’ve never seen managers do less. Worthless morning meanings on how much money YOU need to make today. “Call your friends, tell them about our sale!” Greed, greed, greed. They don’t stock the things people really need despite being enormous. Just disposable goods out of mountains of cardboard. All the old dudes just flirt with moms. They have a company RV drive around to inspect the stores/pose for photo ops/ignore customers while patting each other on the back. It’s just gross."
bad,"8 People had complained about the supervisor an the Regionals manager just kept taking up for him. That's because he's the one that put in in that position. I felt an so did others that we were in a boot camp. Couldn't talk , laugh our go to the restroom without getting a dirty look. Or being asked what we were doing. Even store management complained about him"
bad,Not enough pay to live on. Some people work far more than others. Fast Paced and usually pretty chaotic. Most customers are highly stressed and pretty angry.
bad,sucky store that doesn't care for their employees as they whole heartedly claim.  night shift is the actual force behind the scenes causing everything to keep moving and stay on schedule through they were the lower paid and under appreciated shift day in and day out.
bad,I was terminated for following what an assistant manager told me to do instead of a department supervisor and the assistant manager never said anything in the statement about me following his commands
bad,The job is great if your out of college or retired and looking for part tine work. The  benefits are ok...I’ve seen better. This store lacks a good leader.
bad,If you are looking for a great part time job this is recommended. There is little to no day  full time work for new people at the Daytona Beach Store.
bad,"IT support is a good bridge into what you are really looking forward to do in your career. have to be accessible and willing to change . Enjoy the benefits especially the stock option program, I absolutely love purchasing home depot stock."
bad,I was fired after almost getting run over with the forklift while a manager was operating they would rather side with the team of managers than the associates that are the life blood of the company. Anyway if you want to work here expect low wages high work loads and jerk department supervisors. The choice is yours work at your own risk.
bad,Poor management no benefit to working here low pay no advancement i worked here and got my forklift license but got no raise and they gave me a ton of extra responsibility unbelieveable. on top of that they started saying i wasnt doing enough without holding other associates in my position accountable
bad,"Cons:  Lazy do-nothing employees, undertrained supervisors, minimal pay, high expectations of work, ridiculously low amount of off time (11 days a year, 6 accrued over time)"
bad,"The best thing about The Home Depot is the culture and the co-workers.  The camaraderie was outstanding, whereas the supervisors were lazy and inconsistent in their expectations."
bad,"Zero communication and support from management. Very hypocritical business practices. They pride themselves in being convenient and efficient for customers, and then turn around and go out of there way to deny the staff the ability to practice what they preach."
bad,The management is horrible. They are very rude when it comes to not taking shifts. Also the fes is very rude especially if she is in a bad mood. She is nice at times but you have to walk on egg shells.
bad,All I can say is this should be a job and nothing less the constant disregard for their own employees and failure for upper management to succeed at their own job will drive you crazy.
bad,"Mi experiencia en la tienda de Qro cuando todavía se llamaba Home Mart fue muy mala, entré en maderas, ya había un grupito y me la aplicó, varias veces el jefe y el especialista y el subjefe y un auxiliar se iban a comer y me dejaban solo, a los 3 meses fui a renunciar pero la de RH me terapeó y me dijo que por mi buen desempeño ella me iba a promover a subjefe pero no lo hizo. Después de un año fui a renunciar otra vez y la de RH me quiso volver a terapear y le dije que había incumplido con mi promoción y me dijo que el subgerente había bloqueado mi promoción y ese mismo subgerente promovió a un auxiliar que tenía un mes y que a los 3 meses corrieron por robo y yo en ese año fui 7 veces empleado del mes! cuando cambiaron de jefe en el depa me fue peor pues me bailó a ese subgerente y creo que me quería agredir pero no lo hizo pero cuando yo ya no trabajaba ahí sí agredió a uno de sistemas y lo corrieron. De premio para el primer jefe de maderas que tuve ahora es gerente de tienda, ah! y el gerente de entonces se metió con una empleada que era menor, tenia 17 años. Me tocó un verdadero nido de víboras."
bad,"Homedepot is a great a fun place to work, but management is very bad. They don't care for their employees and don't care for your availability needs. In Homedepot the management blames scything on the employee and doesn't listen to reason."
bad,"I heard from several transfer employees that our store was particularly bad, but Home Depot in general has a reputation for running their stores on a skeleton crew, which means those who are there on any given shift are completely overworked. They also offer very few full-time positions, which means hours for part-time employees on an individual level are kept in the very low range, because part-time employees are the majority of their workforce."
bad,"The management is just awful, it’s not the company it used to be. They don’t support their employees or treat them like they used too. They are so strict on hours and often times they don’t schedule enough in the store because they are always trying to cut hours and then we can get the job done and then they get mad when things don’t get done."
bad,"Company likely needs a reset.   Top heavy with management and merchandising types who don't have a clue about the circus on the sales floor.   Store does not always recognize the ""worker bees"" who show up every day, work hard, and help the customer.  "
bad,"We used to be able to sell Roofing siding gutters installation and windows they just recently stopped installing everything except windows. They expect 6 days a week work week they expect you to be in the store if you're not busy working in the store for free they also want you to do promotions at the store for free. You are not able to write off any of your mileage wear and tear on your truck and they don't compensate you for anything so when it comes down to it if you're not doing $100,000 worth of sales a month you're lucky if you make 40k to 50 kthousand a year after all said and done."
bad,"fun work environment , but not enough employees to work the departments so customers don't always receive speedy service,"
bad,"First, the employees were primarily high schoolers. You could tell there were little cliques happening around. Second, I worked as a cashier and when a customer needs loading assistance, I’d call for one but they would never show up which causes the customers to be angry and come back to you to complain while you’re checking out other customers. You don’t get paid as much by the work you do. My first week of working there, they almost forgot to give me my lunch break until I said something. Sometimes they got me work petty hours like some days I work 4hrs, the next 6hrs and then 7.5hrs. Their scheduling is so inconsistent. Also, I couldn’t ask for a day off on a certain day because I was already scheduled even though it week 3 weeks ahead."
bad,"The Topeka, KS store has been facing several interanal challenges for years and have yet to be fixed. There is no accountability of anyone unless you work hard then if you breath wrong you're yelled at. If you point out an issue they don't listen to you or attempt to make you quite."
bad,"This company has grown too large and as a result has let too many important details slip through the cracks. They cherish their customers far more than their employees. Pay does not reflect the responsibility, knowledge and/or effort required for certain positions. Although they claim to do a lot for the environment, they are the cause and contribute to a great deal of pollution and waste."
bad,They take great consideration over family emergencies.  They also are very helpful to customers that are in need of assistance. They allow the staff to celebrate with each other during the holidays  for instance Christmas parties.
bad,They offer good benefits but low salary.  I like my direct supervisor but overall I think they have poor management.  I have been working with them for over 10 years and the salary increases are just not enough to cover the cost of living increase.
bad,"Store manager took credit for most of employee work. Company tries to excite employees with bonuses. Bonuses are about $200, while the managers take home over 100 times that! One manager told me he netted $30,000 with one bonus."
bad,"Management does not stick to the company policy and picks favorites. Short staffed and very busy. Like being in high school drama. Only reason you get fired is for attendance, or harassment claims. People who have worked there for 2+ years get paid the same amount of new hires. Cashiers are constantly pushed to get ask people to apply for credit card, punished if you do not get a certain amount. Unless you are a cashier you barely get a full break. Customer's happiness over EVERYTHING."
bad,"The team I work with is underpaid and used for customer service which is not our primary focus. We are merchandisers ,they hired us to set bays and do general service ,but with the new Work Module they are following ,its pretty much impossible to accomplish. We are not recognized at Store Functions or as real Associates. Store cross training is at a all time low. This is not the Home Depot I started working at 8 years ago. Its getting harder to be proud of this company. I believe these things will be the downfall of the company in the future."
bad,"poco personal "
bad,I worked in various departments with several different members of management and it was a hit or miss when it came to upper management caring about their employees. My last store manager made it very difficult for a large percentage of the store to have job satisfaction and created a hostile work environment for many of us. Unfortunately the company would often move ASMs to different stores often so it was difficult to build good working relationships with people.
bad,"Order Fullfillment Associate:"
bad,"Management is terrible at Home Depot. Never willing to help out with store tasks even when the store is extremely busy. They need to do a better job of picking who gets to be a manager. "
bad,"Poor pay and weak management, hard to advance in company.  The company forgot who really makes the company , it is the workers in the stores, sales people who makes the sales. These are the backbone of any good company. The Home Depot forgot this."
bad,"Bottom line: if you're responsible for paying the bills at your house and have even average living expenses, you will be scraping  by on the wages this company pays. You're better off going to Lowe's (MUCH better starting pay and advancement opportunities). The only people who are doing well at Home Depot are Store Managers, Assistant Store Managers, and those individuals who started with the company 20+ years ago before they changed their wage policies. Your prior work experience will have no bearing on your starting pay; you'll be lucky to make more than $9.00/hr regardless of position applied for (except for upper management) and yearly raises are negligible and piddly ($0.25 will be the biggest increase you can ever expect unless you change job position). The corporate side of the company tried for awhile to promote a really odd team culture within the stores, which I found to be puerile and very irritating, encouraging grown adults to behave like small children at kindergarten during store meetings. I could go on, but I'd be here all day."
bad,"I was a very hard working employee. I made a lot of friends and became highly certified in my field, the working experience was great but I felt as if I was being over used."
bad,"While they preach about how good they are to their associates, a lot of the management team. (ASMs, DS's included) often only work forward for their own gain and don't mind targeting associates under them to get higher positions."
bad,"My typical day was coming to work, pulling pallets of freight to the floor and stocking. The Freight part of the Job wasn't that enjoyable and I had wish that I had put more effort into searching for places to transfer too. "
bad,"management was disrespectful to my disability does not care if you're sick or have any type of physical limitations or ailments they professionally refuse doctors notes."
bad,"As the full time opener for delivery fulfillment, I would start my day at 5:00 am, retrieve my store phone, and print all the paperwork for the orders that I was responsible for shipping that day. This paperwork would also give me ideas of what orders are going when, so I begin to physically locate those orders and stage them to be picked up as reasonably as possible to save both mine and the delivery companies time. I would also often go through certain orders to make sure everything was correct and physically ready to be shipped on a truck. Often times I did need the hour before we opened to fix mistakes or carelessness of the closing employees of my department. The managers struck me as unprofessional however because they never seemed interested in helping me find solutions to  rare but baffling problems. I've even heard ASM's mutter that they ""hate this place"" which had been"
bad,Love the people I work with. The pay should be alot more for what the workload is. Not very understanding when it comes to issues that may come up with family that may cause you to miss work.
bad,"A typical day involved showing up and hoping there was something for you to do instead of standing around or being the only person to care about customers needs. There was no direction or specific duties in a day and while I was promised full time, I was put off multiple times and asked to be patient while the employee with the full time hours, would hide in the bathroom for most of her shift. Lots of heavy lifting, which I didn't mind a bit, but was annoyed that work got passed off on me while others stood around and watched."
bad,The culture of Home Depot is dog eat dog. Managers are overworked and underpaid. Recognition thru awards is not enough to show your employees you are valued.
bad,I liked the job. The managers though were all young and friends. Never could get their attention. Always was referred to calling Resolutions. Or would ask what you were doing when you were doing your job so it looked like they were doing things in front of the big boss.
bad,"very poor management, especially freight ""supervisor"""
bad,"I only recommend a job at The Home Depot to people looking for a 2nd small part time job, but as a main job it does not pay enough. Full timers are often pestered everyday to bring down pallets even before showing up to work."
bad,The Home Depot no friends to some of its workers during Xmas. Cut hours so even holiday pay failed to make up the difference. Nice way to treat your staff.
bad,Fast paced and micromanage by operations and DH. THE GOOD CUSTOMERS AND MEETING NEW PEOPLE AND HELPING WITH PROJECTS. Learning about new products and procedures.
bad,"I didnt have the best experience working at Home Depot. I remeber being moved to be a ""Pro Loader"" but wasn't given the pay I deserved for working that position. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. Something I did like was that if you wanted a promotion, you had to show that you wanted it. Which meant letting your supervisor know, taking the online training and putting it into practice. That is if you found the time. I wouldn't want to be rehired by them."
bad,"You get on the clock.  the policy is tweaked either for the day or for a short time,  Customers bombard you with product questions because no one is in that department.    I learned to pay attention to detail and product knowledge.  Multi task. Workplace culture is ify.  You are not supposed to talk rough and stupid to each other at other stores but people cursed each other out alot at this particular store.  Managers will talk down to you."
bad,If anything i would use this job to further build a resume. With almost no room for advancement. Most people use this as a stepping stone to other jobs. with the raises being literal pennies annually.
bad,Home Depot is was not a fair and honest place to work for. Very terrible scheduling. No weekends off. Kept minimal staff on hand to squeeze the penny. The managers got their bonuses but the regular worker did not.
bad,"I am positive that the Home Depot is a great opportunity for some people. My experience was less than optimal. I was promoted quickly. I believe this to be due to the fact that I work hard while unsupervised. Maybe its a great place, maybe I didn't fit in with that management team well enough. Either way, you will probably get very little support or training. Be aware."
bad,"A typical day is hectic as an order filler. You need a competent team to get everything done, unfortunately competence is rare and Home depot seemingly gets some of the worst people to fill the roles at the store. As a result, this means that you are often doing everything by yourself as well as commonly covering other departments. Don't expect help either--as soon as you need help every other associate is either busy or injured but they expect your help at the drop of a hat."
bad,Management doesn't know what they're doing. You're constantly moved from department to department. You're asked to do tasks in an unrealistic time period.
bad,"I was always in the middle aisle fronting the products."
bad,"very friendly customers and great place to work, very hands on . Worked in Tool Rental for a year, and moved to M.E.T. ( Merchandising Execution Team)"
bad,"cut throat and quick paced---management says they work with veterans but, I beg to differ. would not recommend a job or career here unless you think you can become popular enough quickly."
bad,"A typical day at work at The Home Depot is very slow paced, but the managers give people busy work because they do not want anyone sitting. They offer rewards for people who exceed their jobs but if you are not a favorite then you often do not get one of those. The hardest part of my job was feeling like I was in competition with others and also feeling as if my work was not good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees."
bad,"This company is no longer what I thought it once was. The company is continuously squeezing more and more out of current associates, and not hiring enough people to run the stores efficiently or effectively."
bad,"Even though I did not like working there, I would not have been able to attend college or graduate had it not been for the store manager working with my hours of availability..."
bad,"I work at the Rapid Deployment Center (RDC) as a ""General Warehouse Associate."" Basically, they use this title as justification to pay everyone the same low wage regardless of responsibilities. For example, lift truck operators get paid the same as someone sweeping the floors. A typical day at work begins at 5 am as we all gather for our rally where our managers discuss the previous day and other important topics.  Afterward, we stretch for 5 minutes and then we grab our equipment (MHE forklifts, scanners, gloves etc.) before heading to our assigned area. The hardest part of the job is dealing with false promises and lack of appreciation for your work even when you go above and beyond. This toxic environment has turned the homer award into patronage system in which awards are given to people without merit. At this RDC, management does NOT care about you and clearly have favorites. Don't fall for their manufactured ""coaching"" moments where they put on their fake smiles to keep you motivated. If you are lucky they won't even talk to you. Furthermore, many of these managers and their lackeys have a superiority complex as they literally look down on you. The curious thing is they are actually terrible at their jobs which makes their overconfidence seem almost comical. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is go home every day (if you are lucky)."
bad,Overall not a bad company but a very large company. No one will likely know or care who you really are. Decent hours but mostly a 40+ age demographic.
bad,"Interline Brands is ruining the name of The Home Depot. The middle management staff lacks knowledge, integrity, and the ability to motivate staff. Staff is required to achieve a 7% GP increase each year month over month in order to hit commission. If one exceeds goal by 20% one month, the following year the associate is expected to eclipse that month's numbers by an additional 7% to hit plan. If one is too successful one year, it makes it almost impossible to be successful the next. The commission payout is also very low compared to the profit being generated."
bad,"The amount they tell you you'll make..most likely will never happen. So many issues with technology, pricing, leads, how to charge, what to charge for, the list goes on. My manager only answers 1/3 questions. It take so many times to get a straight answer. It becomes embarrassing. Other Sales Consultants and myself took it upon ourselves to help/educate each other since our manager was scarce."
bad,"I, now, have nothing positive to say about my experience with The Home Depot.  It is hard to be motivated to come in every day, when you see the management team working whenever they feel like, telling the associates that they suck at their job and then offer no corrective actions for the associates to get better.  I don't know, I suppose I am 'old school' that way, but if i see someone struggling, my first instinct is not to tear that person down, put notes on them in the system, and belittle them until they want to quit.  A typical day would be to clock in, management laugh at your work load they dump on you before they go home for the night, and they don't even finish whatever projects they were working on. No, that is our responsibility now as well.  Work place culture sucks, because everyone has been treated the same way for so long, the only reasons people are staying around is because they have bills to pay still. The hardest part of the job is being able to tolerate being belittled constantly.  The most enjoyable part of the day is easily clocking out to go home, or out to eat, or literally anywhere but within the walls that box."
bad,"After struggling to find hours as a part time associate, a day as a Home Depot cashier usually consists of me ringing up items with a Point Of Sales system. The customers are tolerable, when they're not hitting on you or harassing you. The hardest part of the job is trying to survive on as few hours as part timers are given. No one tells you that during the summer ALL part timers hours are cut. In two weeks I had a total of 20 hours. After taxes, that's less than a $200 paycheck. We got paid much higher than minimum wage, but when only receiving a few hours, it's hard to appreciate the few extra bucks. No one treats you like you're important. They will let customers throw things at you and treat you horribly, then reward them by giving them a discount because they're ""upset"". They schedule me hours that are not on my availability and when asked to correct them, they cover your shift but don't help you make up the hours they took from you. Very few management care about you, it's the other neglected cashiers that make the job enjoyable."
bad,It's a soulless corporation that will suck you for all you're worth and spit you back out. I do not recommend working for them. They do have decent benefits however.
bad,"Hours dropped as low as 12 hours a week for weeks on end, little to no training, they just throw you out on the floor whether or not there are others in your department and expect you to do the job well"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working for this company is the associate-level team. You'll very quickly become a part of their group and make plenty of long time friends within it. Most associates are genuinely caring both instore and out, and it's overall a pretty good time."
bad,"The company only hires a limited amount of people per department, making the work of each division difficult and unbearable for hours on end, possibly an entire shift.  Always understaffed and stressful, management cannot even solve this simple issue."
bad,"While I have found the best crew of guys to work with,  management is spotty and tense.  There is always more work to be done and they are always understaffed.  Pay is low for the work load,  and no time outside work if you are on nights."
bad,I made great friends at Home Depot but besides that I cant say I had a real positive experience at Home Depot. Day crew is relaxed and easy but night crew gets paid the same for real hard work.
bad,This was a good place to work for when started but now I just hate to work there.  The management does not support the employees.  Supervisors and management are not on the same page with instructions on doing job.
bad,"I learned a lot while working at home depot and in general the environment was okay. They had many of us doing too many things though, we sometimes had to solve problems in other departments, do dangerous tasks, and deal with situations we weren't trained for yet. The manager for the garden section was notorious for having a temper and terrorizing some employees. There were a lot of times when we were put under quite a bit of physical strain."
bad,"Although I may not give the company high ratings it doesn't affect the fact that I enjoyed being with and helping people."
bad,Home depot is a good part time job very flexible with schedules its so busy that you feel like time is flying right past you and the other employees are friendly
bad,"The best part of this job was working with my fellow employees. Management at the location I worked was terrible. They would follow employees, tell certain employees the couldn't work together and hide in bushes to try catch people doing something. The Culture was horrendous and management was a joke."
bad,This job is ok if it’s temporary but long term it can be very stressful at least for the store I worked at management seem to never really care about the associates in the store and work environment was toxic.
bad,My honest opinion of this employer is that they are overextending their management team by over-tasking them while setting the expectation that they be in poor position to complete said tasking.
bad,"J'ai démissionné de cette compagnie suite à un refus d'augmentation. Je travaillais de nuit sur des shifts de 10h à 12,20$ de l'heure. J'ai demandé à passer à 13,20$ ce qui a été refusé par la DRH."
bad,"If you get f/t status, benefits are good. but as most are now p/t or contract for hire= your status is uncertain. depending on store mgmt, one may have to contend with office politics."
bad,"Home Depot is a company that tries, but fails to hold on to good, hardworking advocates. The compensation and work environment can't compete with other industries and the upper management doesn't have an interest to attract quality candidates."
bad,Home Depot is a great company to work for buy the manager that rums the store. Make it a bad company. They have great benifits and perks throu out thw year
bad,if your looking for a handout go somewhere else . this is a very tough role and fast paced expected to know alot . leave it to the pros for questions and listen most customers are pros dont need help. best just plan on having two jobs till you can get on your feet in a full time posistion even then you might have a second job . i
bad,"If your direct supervisor like you then you were good. if not then it made it a stressful working environment. You were aloud a 15 min break if some people were not back in 15 min. then they would have to explain why they were not back, others they could be gone 15-45 min and nothing would happen to them."
bad,"I was hired part time, then found out company has fixed  numbers for full time so they don't have to pay benefits. Company safety policies are extensive, but ignored by management when it costs them time or money. No advancement from part time, little afvsncement to management."
bad,The days were long but some customers make up for and also the staff. The staff is amazing to work with. They are very helpful and motivating when needed.
bad,"They say they take care of their associates. They do maybe 50% of the time. But if you want to get cosmetic surgery ( breast implants) they will ask for donations and will match with the Homer Fund."
bad,"It is a good start for part timers! not full timers especially if you want to grow with the company. GOOD LUCK with that. You must be ready for hard labor job for small earning wages. The job culture itself is great, for example, employees have various different compelling stories. However, as far as I'm concern in regardless of management quality, I give a C +. Store manager is very laid back person, easy talk to, gives positive vibe that's because hes constantly in the office not on the sales floor. ASM and Assistant manager are constantly on the sales floor, they are liberally like a cop patrolling in every department making sure everyone do their jobs!"
bad,"Home Depot is a very physically demanding and stressful work place. The rate of pay is MUCH, MUCH too low. The # of work hours vary beyond reason and there is NO consistency in the schedule"
bad,Management would have you be completely over loaded with work and expect you to get it all done plus clean the entire department with no help. Then when you would be unable to complete some of the work because there is an impossible amount for one person you would get reprimanded and in trouble. Pay rate is way too low for the amount of work they overload one person with.
bad,The Managment at the store was terrible. Never before have I had to deal with grown men and women who act like children in a position of power. Constantly treated their employees with malcontent and completely disregarded any in-store problems that arose. When problems did arise and solutions were given the Managment never followed through and problems consistently existed. Unless you were a manager you were treated as expendable. For a company that emphasizes the value of a “team” it was more an organization of individuals.
bad,"low pay"
bad,was fun to help customers but eh management was terrible and disrespectful. I liked the people I directly worked with but the biggest issue was with the scheduling and management.
bad,"The job was hard work, the hours were decent and there was always something to do. The workplace was accepting with coworkers being both helpful and friendly. The customers were demanding but reasonably so for the most part with little to no confrontation occurring during my time working there. Most of the day revolved around assisting customers loading heavy items into their vehicles and anything they may need help finding in store. Altho the hardest part, it was also the most enjoyable to help those customers. "
bad,"Your basic big box retail experience, a lot of work, lower pay, management follows scripted plans and actions, no room for creativity, play the ""game"" for career advancement."
bad,"clean bays and don't talk.  Too much favortism"
bad,"L'aspect le plus difficile sans doute est de servir les clients avec un meilleur service possible. Souvent les clients sont presse, toi en tant que voltigeur, tu dois aider client en premier de tout. Quand il a plusieurs clients en meme temps, en plein ete, ils sont tres impatients... Ceci est tres dur a gerer puisque qu'il faut rester calme et tranquille quand des clients te respecte pas, te parle bete, etc..."
bad,"dept heads lack authority to complete job , plays favorites, some management decisions are not thought through  , no one takes responsibility always blames others, plans are not communicated well to employees  .most importantly no one keeps there word things stated are never carried out as stated and makes excuses when asked about these things. departments are often left unattended"
bad,"I personally would not recommend this company. I needed a job and Home Depot helped, thank you. learned many lessons during my time here and gained a deeper respect for retail employees."
bad,Worked 7 days a week for 4 months.  Monday - Friday was 15 hour days.  Leadership would change directions several times during the shift.  This made it hard to relay information to associates.
bad,"Management is horrible, but there are options for career advancements. If you miss work because you were in the hospital or had to deal with an emergency, they were very unforgiving."
bad,I was not happy with the salary and the lack of advancement. They also did not offer benefits i was making to little. It was steady work but I thought my skill set was higher than this.
bad,"terrible place to work. management does not care about nor will they support regular associates. they have no employees with knowledge or experience, only low paid college kids."
bad,"The Home Depot has a way of bringing you in with lots of incentive. The starting pay was good for what I needed and it seemed like a great company to work for. The management was poor. They do promote within the company, but they push you to your limits to see how far you can go without folding under pressure."
bad,You lift 5 gallon buckets of paint and stack them 3 high on pallets as fast as you can all day or play a game of tetris mixed with jingga using various sized boxes.
bad,"never appreciates my work, never makes room for me to grow, environment is boring after same routine everyday, doesnt give enough sick days in a 6 month period"
bad,fun place to work if you can forget that you aren't being paid well and only nominally recognized for your good ideas -- people that you work with are generally great so that's a plus and you do learn a lot being there
bad,"Home Depot did not fit my needs for advancement. I required day shift hours, and in order to advance I would have needed to work a flex schedule which I was unable to do. Management continuously made promises regarding schedules and raises that were not kept. They work there good employees for all they are worth and allow sub-standard employees to show up and collect a pay check."
bad,"It’s a very stressful place to work. We are expected not only to make our sales goals, but we are expected to get leads for installations and outside sales"
bad,The store manager at home depot 1501 is very dishonest. The company does not treat their employees very well and schedules illegal hours. The pay is terrible for the amount of work I am expected to do on a daily basis.
bad,"This is one of those places where they have this great thing that if you do your job, you get to do other people job as well. Also the more you do the less you get recognized or appreciated because all your back breaking work is expected"
bad,This company is great when it comes to benefits however workers are underpaid for the amount that they do and the stress that they deal with is extremely high.
bad,Offers health/dental/vision and 401K. great team members that provide a relaxed and enjoyable work environment. Management however is not sensitive to family emergencies and personal time off is quite limited.
bad,"The upper management that was there when I was employed there was horrible, very nasty and rude. Went to them to talk about a situation and nothing was done about it. I was also told by a FEMALE manger I was dressed inappropriately however when I spoke to my immediate supervisor about he did not have a problem with my attire. There are older women there that are jealous of the younger ones at leaat that was my experience. The garden manager is nasty no one likes her there. I have heard plenty of complaints about her from different peers."
bad,At one time I enjoyed working here. Unfortunately I found out that I only enjoyed working for the direct management above me at that time. Afterwards I seemed to be the only one with my best interest. There are teams that are an absolute joy to work with but unfortunately in my case a few bad apples spoiled the bunch.
bad,Overall well run organization. Not going to get rich working there. Quality of management varies from store to store. Health benefits were minimal. The hardest part of the job was lifting and moving heavy objects/boxes.
bad,"At first, this place seems pretty cool, if you live close to the area then the traffic isn't so bad since you won't have to deal with I-285. They also seem to have a daycare and a CVS there too and the food isn't so bad but that's where everything good seems to end. Unless you come in at 6 in the morning you really won't find good parking anywhere in the parking lot. Management seems to have no problem smiling in your face and telling lies to you and changing things up at the last minute. You can definitely tell there are cliques between each group. The team camaraderie seems to be out of whack sometimes. They tell you that you have unlimited access to perform your job but you'll quickly find out that that's not the case. Ideas seem to get shut down as soon as they come up and their reasoning will be ""It's not a priority at the moment."" Then they'll turn around and tell you that you're not driven enough to perform your job so they'll cut you loose.The culture there isn't so bad but the management is horrible and leadership is definitely lacking here. It's pretty slow paced too so if you enjoy an easy paycheck then this might be the place but if you're looking for a challenge, a place to be tested, a place to grow your skills, and a place to earn your paycheck then look somewhere else."
bad,The job required too much stress and physical labor for the compensation it provided.  It required knowledge of the entire store and a lot of sweat and heavy lifting with too few breaks.
bad,Diverse . Great  Inventory  convenient location and hours close to transportation  hours offered could use more advanced option .  Ability to transfer
bad,"They seem really nice in the beginning, but the environment is super dreary and bland. The work is never balanced, either so much work you feel like you are dying, or so little work that your performance standards aren’t met. The management clearly picks favorites and lets the favorites do whatever they please. They take advantage of hard workers and make them not want to work anymore. They pay everyone the same rate ( seems like a good idea, but some jobs are MUCH more difficult than the others). They say you can advance, but they always advance the favorites before you regardless of the rules. I’ve have heard that this only happens at the Van Buren location. If you want to work at Home Depot, don’t let this be the location you choose."
bad,"been with the company for a long time and is loosing the customer service piece that brick and mortar needs so much. Management is so worried about their bonuses. Take away all the nonsense for associate, bonus ... everything.... and pay better and find better health coverage ."
bad,"it was fun i enjoyed working there ,,i worked really well customers love me i get along well with them n also with my co workers my boss is very accurate"
bad,"Very low pay for hard labor job! Lack of hours. Lack of fulltime work. I worked there for over a year waiting for a full-time position to open. I was never given seniority when it became available. Instead, a new employee was hired to take that full-time position that opened up."
bad,"Full time employees are on their feet all day, fixing every detail possible in each bay. Lots of checking lists, organizing, rearranging. This job is demanding and requires 100% attention to detail. There is no room for leniency as everything you do is tracked through a handheld computer. It is also filthy; a big part of the job is cleaning up dust. Not a place for you if you have allergies to birds, wood, concrete, dirt, ect. Most of the employees are retirees who need a little extra income or something to do. It may take 1 yr+ to get a full time position."
bad,"Assist customers and the need in the home improvement. I went to the Home Depot with knowledge of plumbing and leadership skills. Management was good in certain areas, but the inconsistencies were not a selling point for Home Depot. This accounted for the hardest part of the job. I enjoyed helping people"
bad,Simple straight forward job with fair pay the only negative things are poor management and aggressive  confrontational panhandlers who get in the way when you attempt to help a customer.
bad,"On the tech side, the majority of people hired are contractors for their first 6-18mo. from what I could tell, and as much as they try to tell you that everyone is treated the same, they are not, and it creates a ton of unnecessary tension. Definitely an 'us' (contractors) vs. 'them' (associates) atmosphere unlike what they would have you believe. Even as experienced professionals, my fellow contractors and I routinely discussed how it made people feel unwelcome and stressed."
bad,Home Depot is a decent place to work but doesnt seem to provide much opportunity unless you are hand and hand with one of the managers who help build you up. Plenty of co-workers said they tried to do different things and were denied. I was overlooked at a certain position when asked to learn it. It had its upsides as far as VTO or certain holidays off but still had plenty of downsides
bad,Typical day at work consists of angry costumers and my manager yelling at me to get credit cards. Free food that are at the holiday buffets are really good because it's all homemade.
bad,The Home Depot was alright to work for at the beginning but then they started cutting hours. They wanted credit cards but wasn't offering any benefits
bad,"A typical day at work is normal for anyone that works there."
bad,"stood at register and waited for customers to come to me so I could wait on them, had hardly any hours, had experience in other areas of the store but management wouldn't allow me to work any where else"
bad,"This is a warehouse environment designed for students and temporary workers.  Must like moving things around every day.  Very fast paced environment and not much training on the floor,  Great employees.  Big turn over of workers."
bad,"Stocking merchandise onto shelves. Organizing the sales floor to create a pleasant and safe shopping environment. Providing customer service."
bad,I heard back a few years ago this was one of the best paying jobs and advancement opportunities for the retail job sector. After 2008 times sure have changed in this company. Less pay and very much less incentives and benefits in this work place.
bad,"The problem with home depot is that it's somewhat mindless there training every month some time weekly. in some sense, you get an idea that  the management are not the most fabulous people"
bad,"It's nice because it's not the same thing everyday. At the same time, there's not a huge chance for advancement because those positions are secure. You have department heads and store managers, nothing in between. You have to work a year before you get a raise, and a very minimal one at that. Not everyone who you work with is willing to help get the job done. I've seen the laziest people get the most credit from their superiors, and the hardest working people get knocked for a simple slip up... I guess it depends on what you're looking for, what you can actually take away from this job."
bad,I have only experienced the Marietta Technology Center security environment therefore this negative reflection should not be reflected upon the entire Home Depot.
bad,You are always promised a ladder to climb however when opportunities arrive you are more often than not overlooked or told you are unqualified even if you have been going through the proper steps to achieve climbing the ladder. They don't reward their harder workers but rather push them to work harder while other less motivated employees slide by under the radar. They also underpay for the amount of physical strength and endurance it takes to complete the job. Overall this job is not a warehouse job I would recommend to a friend or family member.
bad,"Working at Home Depot does have some benefits, but they are stagnant and do not meet the same pay that most companies would for the work put in. If you are looking for advancement, good luck, getting past a supervisor role is a 5+ year commitment with no guarantees. The pay for a supervisor role starts at $13 and you will typically get a 3-4% raise once per year. In my time there when they bumped their minimum pay for basic positions up they did not up the pay for people who were already past that point. For the heavy workload they give you it is not worth doing for the compensation. Management will roll out new programs to help associates and then fail to follow up or continue with it. Management tends to be quite passive aggressive and not very professional. They also expect you to pretty much surrender the 15 minute breaks every associate has once you become a supervisor, by giving you an overloaded amount of work and then threatening you with a write up if not completed(especially in specialty departments). In my time there I saw more and more of their dedicated and tenured and most knowledgable and helpful associates leave, when that happens they simply put more of a workload on the ones they already leaned on and do nothing about associates who do not carry their own weight. They always use success sharing as a constant motivator and bring up how many other companies don't do that, but when it comes down to it you can expect roughly $200(twice a year) after taxes and it has consistently dropped during the time I was there and will continue to because they are always pushing"
bad,This company used to be a great family oriented business but now its a corporate world where you are replaceable in a minute. I was an employee for 6 years then was terminated without my knowledge while on maternity leave.
bad,"I would get a stern talking to or yelled at for minor things, like not saying hello to the manager when not hearing him say anything, asking another associate how to do something when no manager is present or too busy to help. begging department heads for my mandatory breaks sometimes or they would forget and never give you breaks."
bad,A typical work day at the home depot would include me standing at the register and providing great customer service with each guest throughout the day.
bad,Good place to work if you are a college student. Managers were decent but mainly everyone fends for themselves. If you work as a lot associate you will be taken advantage of.
bad,"Home Depot was a very stressful place to work. Also the concrete floors were hard on your knees, back and feet. The turnover rate for employees were horrible.Employees didn't like working their shifts and the dedicated ones who cared didn't get recognized for their hard work and effort."
bad,"I worked for the company at a higher and lower volume store, and I have to say that the whole reason I'll never apply here again is due to short staffing in almost every department."
bad,"I wore many hats at Home Depot and did not receive any special compensation for that. Some times I ran several departments at once, carrying around numerous radios and would pick up a third when someone decided to just go to lunch. They were quick to train you and encourage you to learn more but they never compensate you for what you know. Having additional knowledge or training resulted in absolutely no pay increase and just added stress. I hope whoever looks for a job here likes to juggle."
bad,U have to understand things goes further down hill after being there want something new bt I still not recommended this job to anyone. I need some new idea and new place of employment
bad,Started out as Temporary and try to get full time. Was averaging about 35 hrs a week and all of sudden the drop my hours to  around 12 hrs a week. Can't live off 12 hrs a week.
bad,"The stress level is high, very little to no positive feedback. It's all about numbers and not about the people.  They hire poor management and play favorites."
bad,The job was okay. The pay was okay but they will not let you get overtime and they procrastinate about making you permanent. They did work with school hours.
bad,Working at the YUMA Home Depot is terrible because of management. They treat you like dirt and expect you to jump through hoops to make them happy but if you need anything good luck. They don't care.
bad,"The job itself is okay but when it comes down to management and everything they put you through, it's not worth it! They seem to mess with their hardest workers."
bad,"Great work place"
bad,"The HD had a great working environment. I enjoyed the morning start-up meetings because they kept our team's goals in perspective. I liked the activities because they involved the individual team members and allowed us to give our opinions and bond. HD was also very flexible with my college schedule."
bad,"A typical day. "
bad,"I have worked here for several years, I find the management uncaring about the workers.  No matter how hard you work only certain people will get a pat on the back or rewarded.  I got reviewed, after not being reviewed for months.  I have not gotten a raise in a long time.  Some of my co-workers are very nice, but when I ask questions of managers I find that far too many people, especially ones who have been there a long time, tell me they don't know.  I do enjoy helping the customers, but without proper training it is hard to give the customers information they need.  I have been left alone in my dept, especially during holiday times when the store is busy.   I needed to call a manager to get more people to help me.  I feel frustrated and stressed and every day I just want to quit."
bad,Home depot is not a good company to work for. They do not care about their employees. The turnover was very high. They fired people without proper investigation. The pay rate was terrible. They actively stifle efforts to unionize.
bad,"The IT department use to be very tough -- however, at this time the racism issues in this department makes employment here not a good choice. Poor raises, bonus and marginal work treatment. No career growth under current leadership -- except for those of Indian decent"
bad,clocking in at 8 in the morning is generally the scheduled time but there would be times where we wouldve had to clock in at 6 am to have group huddles that would last for and hour and a half sometimes. definitely many calls went through and the pay was not worth the amount and type of work
bad,I would pass. Honestly only working here to fill in time till something better either comes along or I find something that pays better. One redeeming thing is my current Department Head
bad,"very stressful"
bad,"What really happens at Home Depot."
bad,"You are expected to ensure everyone is happy regardless of how. You are expected to do arduous tasks with very little pay, and there is no hope for advancement unless you make your job your life. Little pay, and a difficult, stressful, hot working environment."
bad,"I have a great schedule ,5am to 1:30 Monday thru Friday."
bad,"During the time I worked at Home Depot, the management was so bad even supervisors were unpleased. Multiple people were quitting due to poor management, the lack of pay, raises, and workers being mistreated."
bad,"The overall environment is good, but the new culture seems to be to dismiss the concerns of the customer. The staffing is inadequate, forcing everyone else to do more while earning very little."
bad,"I had a very hard time at this job, I would take back to back calls all day while all the younger reps would only get a quarter of the calls that I would. They called it 'Matter Site' some call flow system that matches customer to reps. Really its discrimination and if you are not in the cool kids club you will get back to back calls all day while watching other people around you watch youtube and play game s all day. I talked to management many times about this and asked for proper compensation and eventually I had to leave this company, one of the worst experiences I have ever had."
bad,"This job is good, however there were issues. The technology at this job only temporarily works which makes the job harder than it needs to be.There aren't many opportunities to move up into better positions. The pay isn't high enough for all the work that the employees do and for the extra things that are expected."
bad,"Since I started at Home Depot, I thought it would be a pleasant run and easy fit, but my experience continues to prove otherwise. First, management is horrible, hourly scheduling is even worse with sometimes only one worker on duty and other times none."
bad,The problem is that employees are given tasks that 2 people are suppose to handle. There is barely any help from co workers unless it is forced on them to act. Yearly raises are cents to the dollar if performance was stasfactory.
bad,"Customer Service is the number one priority in every aspect of the building. No matter what your job title is, the customer comes first. Pride in the apron makes the culture."
bad,if I can work here so can you. this job has a lot of favoritism . but if you get one manager who like you stay with them. learn from the and grow with them.
bad,The pay here is good but if you don't kiss a** this isn't the job for you. They have a lot of double standards when working here. I worked over night and still didn't like management.
bad,Pro Loader was a very boring job waiting around to help load up contractors could  not leave the area did not utilize my skills forklift driver or packdown
bad,This company is obviously well known. The starting pay is terrible. The benefits would have cost me more than my measly hourly rate. Management is on you like a hawk tracking a mouse from above.
bad,Not the place to work if you need a fulltime job that pays the bills. Only work 3 -12 hour days a week and can not move up if you have a relative working there.
bad,"I didn't get the great end of things at The Home Depot "
bad,Managers will come down on you if you are reprimanded by a customer. Customers are always right which most of the time they are wrong. I took my job serious and took pride it in but when I see someone spray paint in the store near I will say something but I am in the wrong. Home depot loses more money by customers using what they buy and bring it back. If you ain't kissing management butt you ain't getting a good raise. Co workers are very friendly and will help you if you need it. If you get overwhelmed and it is time for your break you won't get a manager to help you. Used to have a program where you collect 5 badges and get a 100 dollars but they got rid of that. Cashiers make more and deal with customers the least.
bad,"Home Depot is an okay part-time job to help supplement a low paying full-time job.  THD is not for the person who needs to support themselves. Best part of the job is awesome customers!  Worst part of the job is the schedule, the low-pay, managers and co-workers who will work you to death.   Standing on concrete for hours starts to mess with your feet and legs."
bad,"Hours are not conducive to maintaining much of a personal life.  As p/t hours are very low except for major holidays.  Lousy hours create a higher turnover than necessary. "
bad,"There is an excellent culture set by the corporation. However, when you get to certain stores it has become lost in translation. Excellent Standard of work set by the company as a whole. The culture has become lost at most store levels. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with store politics."
bad,Managers are not great. Takes up a lot of your time. Didn't like anything but the hours. Pay is very low and they can afford to pay all employees more.
bad,"This job was great. However, regardless of the several positions one learned and executed on a daily basis, one could still not obtain full time work. I was punctual and reliable and enthusiastic, to no avail. I had to leave for financial reasons."
bad,I really have nothing to say about this place.  I worked there for almost year and found myself dreading work and wanting something better.  No one can live off part time hours.  Places like Home Depot need to hire full time
bad,"Very corporate environment, so be aware of that going into the company. Hard to make moves within the company unless you've been in a position for a year."
bad,"This is a fun place to work with good pay but if you are not part of the ""click"" you will not advance...ever! They fire for the littlest reasons as well so make sure you are PERFECT...literally. You don't have a great schedule either and you will have to work on the weekends and horrible hours so if you don't have kids or school to attend, then this should work for you. The work is really easy so the pay is great to just sit around."
bad,No job security. Home Depot does not give good pay raises. work culture is terrible. They do not care about there employees and will terminate an associates employment for any reason even if the associate did nothing wrong.
bad,Manager was always stressed and very inconsiderate. There is not much else to say. But the employees and job itself was not bad. but the leader/manager in power ruined any chance of a good day.
bad,"My availability was: Friday, Saturday and Sunday at any time. "
bad,"The Work environment was very fast paced, but the focus of the store was mainly to provide the best customer service at all times. Depending on what department you were assigned, the management was hard working and helpful."
bad,"A typical day at work includes maintaining the department, servicing customers and answering (meticulous) questions on home improvement products, and making custom paints for customers. Management did not enforce strong leadership qualities at the location I worked for. However, co-workers were usually cooperative. Pertaining to my location, the environment was somewhat hostile and both customers and employees demonstrated discriminatory behaviors against the LGBT and occasionally the latino community (not physically, but verbally and through actions)."
bad,Okay and fun at times. This company is alright to work for just for extra income in the spring and or summer times. This company can do more for employee moral and overall satisfaction for work life balance as a whole
bad,Difficult place to work because management was not open to fresh ideas and didn't understand that business success is driven by the culture established by the management.  Taking care of employees and making them feel like an important part of the organization motivates them and promotes success.
bad,Typical day at work would consist of coming into work and helping customers through-out the day. I learned very little in the terms of product due to the lack of training. Management picked their favorites and no one else mattered.
bad,"Rotating schedule is horrible.  You might open one day, then work 2 mid shifts, then close the final days with rotating days off too.  Makes it impossible to have any normal sleep patterns or work a second job.  You will want a second job because the pay isn't great and the raises will only buy you an extra sandwich per month when you get them twice a year."
bad,"Management does not care about you, only wants the customer to return and buy something. Overly concerned with selling credit card accounts.Always trying to sell contractor services to customers"
bad,"I been working here for 4 years. Have zero occurrences. And make little to nothing. I am a trained forklift drive, pro truck driver, flooring speaclist, also certifetd to work in 3 departments. Every raise I made was a joke and a smak in the face."
bad,Co-works were amazing but the management and corporate teams are just terrible. To much work for not enough pay and unobtainable goals.
bad,"Too many open promises of which never came through.  Power hours are stupid especially on the weekdays from 10 am to 2 pm, which is when no one is  actually shopping at the store."
bad,"I signed up to be a cashier, not a sales person.  All they do is push cashiers to get credit cards, which annoys customers, really annoys the customers behind them.  Short staffed.Does NOT cultivate a 'team' environment."
bad,"great place to work nice environment. People are friendly for the most part. No room for advancement. You have to know the right people to move up. You can work hard as you want but if they don't see it in you, you won't go anywhere with the company."
bad,"The job isn't overly hard, but the pay is low and the hours suck. They expect you to be available 24/7 but only hand out 10-20 hours a week."
bad,Greeted customers on a daily basis to ascertain what each customer wanted or needed.  Detailed products to customers and explained details and care of merchandise.  Provided an elevated customer experience to help generate loyal customer retention.  Handled daily heavy flow of paperwork and cooperated with the management on invoicing and shipping problems.
bad,"Poor leads, very expensive product, management offers little or no direction. They set you up to fail. Going out on 2-3 leads a day, closing 1 a week if that. No reimbursement for gas,tolls,wear and tare."
bad,"This particular store is a hard place to work. They pick favorites. These people get special treatment and are able to bend rules. They expect you to make miracles when they don't even give you the tools, staff or proper equipment to even succeed. Management mostly just barks orders and scolds instead of giving back positive feedback. None of the registers and other systems work. They constantly break down and/or crash yet you get treated like it was your fault and they never have these things replaces. They say they can't. I just feel like at this particular store nothing runs smoothly and management is unfair, rude, disrespectful and well honestly some are very lazy and don't know what they are doing. I've heard other locations are much better.  Do not work for this particular location."
bad,"The job can be rewarding, but is not great for the physically challenged.  Can be great fun during staff events.  Shift work can seriously interfere with a home life."
bad,Ok place to work with great pay. They don't really stick to your schedule so I would not recommend working if you are going to school. You also need a lot of training.
bad,Home Depot used to be a place that you would go for all your home improvement needs. Now rather than hiring people that know anything about the trades they hire people off the streets and moreover they don't hire enough of them so that leaves everyone feeling over worked. My department consisted of 4 people and together we managed to account for 25% of the stores sales. Some of the managers there were less than useful. I do have to say that I really enjoyed my co workers. If it wasn't for that the job wouldn't be worth it all. It seems that corporate management is only concerned with their stock price and does not care about the struggles that their underpaid employees go through. To add some more perspective in my store I department manager only made 13$ an hour.
bad,"I worked with some excellent men on the overnight shift. That was by far the best part of the job and have maintained my friendship with several of them after I left the company."
bad,I didn't have the best experience but it wasn't. I wish I could've relocated and my experience might have been better. It was like high school for me.
bad,"When I started working for Home Depot 1997 everyone pulled together and we all did our best to provide excellent customer service."
bad,People are the key in this business. If you have good people working for you then it makes your job easier just like any other company. Way too much rumors and gossip happens in depot. Not just one store but many......... If mgmt. likes you then you are good but if they don't then God help you........
bad,It was a great positive environment that taught me new home improvement skills I wasn't aware of before working there. Gave me a great chance to interact and engage in great work affiliations such as big business owners and self contractors.
bad,"good advancement opportunity, good benefit. a lot knowledge and training available . a lot of certification available to learn. online classes giving in place. you get to meet a lot of peoples."
bad,Excellent for teens going to school not a career place excellent benefits like 401K and stock and many discounts with other companies for working at the Home Depot
bad,Found customer relations was huge with company and management would rather take a loss than base their findings on fact and truth. It meant more to try and bribe their customers with gift cards than try to be productive and have the company bottom line be good. Company did not believe their employees word over customers either. Employee was always wrong Customer was always right regardless of facts.
bad,"will stress to you in orientation how importantant attendance is and will say thats the main thing that will get you terminated but fired me due to my production numbers. wrote me up back to back due to my performance, had no patiance when it comes to you getting comfortable on your equipment. took over a month before i was finally trained on the fork lift and gave me my second write up only two weeks after receiving my certification. received my final write up a week later, then was terminated the following week!"
bad,"For the most part, the lower tier management was very friendly and helpful while the upper tier was constantly harping on numbers as if everyone were on the verge of being fired every week. It was disconcerting."
bad,It was okay but the managers did not seem to bridge the gap to the associates which resulted in lots of inefficiencies. Under qualified individuals in management or supervising positions.
bad,Was a nice place to work when younger and looking for a place to start. Pay is not good at all but I had fun when I worked there. Met some friends that I still have today.
bad,"Not only is it your typical big box retailer but a bad place to work, I mean from management to peers, schedules, hours, flexibility, fairness, etc."
bad,Typical American Corporation. People at the top get way too much pay. People at the bottom do not. No way to make a decent living. They actively encourage government help to off set low pay.
bad,"Honestly I do not know what to say about home depot besides the number one retailer with some great profits each and every year could try a lot more for the people whos backs they are making so much off of.  Bad pay, bad hours, sloppy management, but some awesome friends and coworkers."
bad,"One of the worst places I've ever worked. Management doesn't really seem to care at all about the individual (aka you the worker). Saftey standards are pretty low compared for the work being done. Commpensation for work completed seems low,kept so by scheduling workers for less hours and expecting  more from less time. In conclusion, it is not satisfying work,made so by lack of hours available to work. Also,schedules change on the fly,often with no warning. Meaning,you can be late or not show up to work when you were supposed too because you didn't check on your schedule that day."
bad,"The pay and job security was decent. Other than that, the place is poorly managed."
bad,"The Home Depot is overall a great place to work if you are 18 years old and live at home. For someone with children and a monthly rent or mortgage to pay, it is hardly a salary to live off of. You work 4, 10 hour days which is not bad but the shift i personally work is from 5pm to 3:30 am, Monday thru Thursday. With a 4 year old at home, I barely get sleep. Most of the leadership are inexperienced in the department they've been placed. The favoritism in the building is unbelievable and the pay is the same whether you break your back or sit at a computer all day. The healthcare is expensive is you have a family but they do offer a quarterly bonus based on the buildings success. It takes an associate a minimum of 3 years to make $15.00 an hour because you only receive an annual raise of .30-.45 cents. This review is based on my personal life and opinions. Like i said if you are 18-20 years of age and live with your parents, this is the job for you. Anyone supporting a family i suggest this job as temporary, until you can find one better."
bad,"I enjoyed working for the customer and talking with the customer but I did not enjoy my supervisor always wanting me to do pack down even doing times that were power hour that we were supposed to interface with the customer, my supervisor always wanted me to bring down the items from the overheads."
bad,"great benefit , salary is so bad the human resource is horrible too, I can't say I enjoy that place , you have to think before to star there , the only important for the company is customer that is"
bad,"Home Depots`s training was extremely deficient. Communication from management to dept.mgrs, and then to employees was not effective. The job decription for the dept. mgrs. was not forthcoming."
bad,"I enjoyed the type of work I did for Home Depot, but the pay is not great, and raises, do not compensate for the quantity, and quality of the work performed."
bad,"No a bad place to work and the hours are flexible if you are attending college or school. Supervisor are really responsible, co-workers are helpfully when you ask questions."
bad,"la gestion du personnel est très faible et manque de communication"
bad,"Management is terrible, hard to contact managers on duty. Supervisors don't do their jobs. I liked working here because they offered a lot of benefits, I liked meeting new people as well."
bad,"This store has a very different environment then Lowes. The managers are not as nice, The hours are horrible, not one weekend nor holidays available. Very hard to move up in the company."
bad,"I just filled out the employer of choice survey, they say that they want to be the employer of choice for all segments that they compete in.  It just makes me focus on the ways they are a second rate employer.  If you work for exteriors, and were hired in after they bought RMA (which is now Home Depot Exteriors) you get no paid vacation, although the guys who were around before Home Depot bought it still do.  Store associates, as well as most competitors of any size also give paid vacation.  Commissions typically are about 2% below the industry norm, justified by the fact that you have the privilege of representing Home Depot.  Company policies are un equally applied.  Sales people are told that things are done by the book, but mis specs arbitrarily charged back against sales people with no accountability for remeasure people who mis measure, and conflicts between sales people are determined by sales volume despite company policy.  "
bad,"Inventory management itself was easy to maintain, but communication and lack of employees per department create expectations that cannot be fulfilled"
bad,"When I first started working there I would say management was okay, and they way they would schedule was decent for a part time job. But then it all went down hill when new management not all the managers were bad but the Store manager didn't really  care about the employee's, he just wanted to make sales and care about the customers. I was asking if I could get one day of the weekend off even it was once a month, basically told me that's why I hire part-timers for the weekend I explained I go to school full time and work another job and I would need at least one day of the weekend to catch up with school work, he didn't care and it ended up with me leaving that place. The work environment was terrible  everyone would always talk about other people or management and nothing was ever positive in that corporation."
bad,After being there for a while at least at store 1039 management leaves you very unhappy and unwanted there. It becomes a place of favoritetism.
bad,This is a cool job for someone coming out of high school or just looking to supplement there income. Management seems not to be on the same page regarding policies and work distribution.
bad,"Great work environment, with fun coworkers and customers. Very productive establishment. The only downfall is very poor management and hr."
bad,The people you work with are the best thing about working at Home Depot.  Management however does not care about the people.  You are easily replaced and they let you know that every day.
bad,"Decent place to work for the time, Nothing amazing about it, nor terrible.Had time there during college, and stayed a little bit after. Nothing overwhelming in their job culture."
bad,"At the begging of work things were usually the same we would start then look at the job and show up to home depot for the materials."
bad,"I learned a lot you was in all areas.Management was week,co-workers for the most part fine.No hard part about this job.enjoyed working with the people and helping them with projects"
bad,Home Depot once was the best company in the world now they pay like Walmart and treat people like Cattle. Glad that I got out when i did department managers in my area literally make less than i got to push carts years ago
bad,"Home Depot is a great place to work if you are one of the favorites otherwise it isn't that great. I have seen many a promotions given to employees who spent more time brown nosing than doing their job."
bad,"Most employees are part time and could care less about their jobs.  10% of associates do 90% of the work while the rest do next to nothing.  Management is hostile and offer nothing but negativity and act like nothing is ever good enough. Pay is ok, benefits pretty good, bonus program is decent as well."
bad,Co-workers are amazing. Management is awful and workplace vibes are awful as well. Not many people are happy working there and the work load they place on people is unreasonable.
bad,"I enjoyed my team I worked with. We helped each other out when needing help. We would make it fun where we wouldn't hate our job at times it was just to much. It got us through the day."
bad,The most I like about my job is that you get to know people from different cultures and you get know about them they likes and dislikes and there families.
bad,"Minimal pay, management problems. The store has to many managers and not enough regular employees. Maximum yearly raise is 25 cents, regardless of how hard you work."
bad,"management change your schedule to much without notice hours are bad and management has no regard for family life,most request for time off is not granted"
bad,Did things for the associates every week. Had a homer fund for current associates. Success sharing if we made sales twice a year one in March and the other one in September.
bad,Management feels like they play favorites store moral is low. Some supervisors do not belong being supervisors. Co-workers are great though
bad,Working for Home Depot was a learning experience.   I learned a lot about construction material.   We had a lot of management turnover and that working with some of their personalities was challenging at times.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job would definitely some of the associates that i get to work with, the kind of people that just make coming to work fun."
bad,On a typical day includes not enough staff. Trying to get the store ready for the customer but being pulled away by a store manager to do non sales or non customer tasks. There was a sense of entitlement by Store managers and higher that they were more important that the customer. This was especially true of the District management teams and higher. The store associates would do anything that was needed to take care of the customer but many times if you were not a favorite of the District team you were not recognized. Many of those that were being promoted were done so to fit a minority spot but were not given the support to succeed ( they were not prepared to do the job). Once they failed then the current favorite of the District team would get the position. This person would do the same type of job as the person that they replaced  but nothing happened to them. Anyone who did do the required job with respect and integrity they were gotten rid of once some one else who made less money was hired.
bad,"At home depot I worked the night shift. Fulfillment is what the  job was titled, but it was so much more. I was responsible for many the departments lumber, millworks, building materials. Because I was used to driving machines from my previous job I was able to pick up really quickly, most nights finishing all my jobs a few hours early. At that point I would go and move into the seasonal or garden center department and do fulfillment there."
bad,"management needs some serious changes, very hostile work environment"
bad,"The Home Depot can be great, but it depends on when you work and what you do.  I worked overnight and was payed 9.25 for weekdays and weekends.  This is not great compensation for difficult hours and schedules.  Management was not receptive to workers advice on efficient alternatives and often were not visibly working themselves. This and continuous degradation from managers and supervisors made Home Depot less than enjoyable.  However, my coworkers were all fun and hard-working and added to an overall good experience learning how to work with others.  I am sure other employees of Home Depot will say otherwise, but given my job, compensation and management, I do not recommend Home Depot."
bad,"My day is to help the customers and do the heavy lifting, which I didn't mind.  I learned much about the gardening area, and about zoning, and while the job was ok, the hours I received were not.  In fact, I have to say that I was supposed to be full-time and only got part-time hours.  Getting by on such a salary is impossible.  The enjoyable part was working with the customers."
bad,"I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, but as a whole, we as a night crew were not treated like members of the company."
bad,Working at Houston Home Depot has taught me lots of things. It does not limit to multi-tasking only. Working culture is my appropriate for me because you can see that every is ready to extend a helping hand even at a very tiring day. The working atmosphere as I can describe is playful and very encouraging though there are times that it is not due to certain circumstances that arises.
bad,"hectic, multitasking a alot, head cashiers are not well trained, always short on employees, never off on time because managers are not focused. "
bad,"Typical day would be spending 1/2 my shift taking care of issues fro the day before and then spending the second half teaching, coaching, and training my associates on how to cut down on customer complaints."
bad,"Not enough hours, underpaid, poor management and training.  Mostly you learn as you go. Management is slow to advance.  I worked there for over a month on the floor and didn't even know who was my Department Head."
bad,A typical day at work may entail assisting the lumbar department with large orders.  It could also include loading customer purchases as well as the contractors large orders.
bad,"boring. i learned about money transactions and payables. management is kind of strict but reliable to work with. co-workers are cool, the hardest part of the job is when you are beating the deadlines, and of course the enjoyable part is when you finished it."
bad,"From a district level management MET seems to exercise extreme bias towards advancement with no regard to duration of employment, job skills and ability to perform essential job duties. The decision is made based upon personal feelings toward specific employees, which is completely unprofessional."
bad,the home depot is a job to go and die at. Refuse to give full-time hours and use part timers with poor pay and terrible hours.
bad,You can be let go asap for not preforming right away they want you to get trained in one day then they want you to make rate at 100%. They need to give new hires more time with picking up the rate.
bad,"The distance was tough to travel, I tried to transfer to a different store, they would not let me. I tried to quit, they gave me no hours my last two weeks,when I talked to the HR supervisor, she gave me 30 hours the week AFTER my two weeks were over."
bad,"Each day is a full day, helping customers find the products they need for there projects. Most of my co-workers complain about management, direction, each has there own story, but the bottom line is ""not a sufficient number of employees on the floor each day, to make the job a fun job."" The hardest part is, over tasked, ""The best part of the job is when I'm going home"", which I hear every day."
bad,Allows employees to talk with slang on the radio and to leaders. My boss was really unprofessional with the way he talked and acted. Never experienced anything like this in my life.
bad,Perks like free lunches once in a while. Hours are cut drastically in winter/spring. Scheduling is all over the place. One day you could be working for a 5 hour and 15 minute opening shift and then the next day you could be working a 6 hr and 45 minute closing shift. If you are working in the winter don't be surprised if your suppose to work a 8 hour shift and they drop it down to a 4 hour shift.Associates and management are pretty friendly.
bad,"Home Depot is a great starter job for younger workers. At this job you will learn a great deal about all sorts of home improvement products and methods as well as get an introduction to sales and customer service."
bad,"Helping customers decide which products to purchase, making sure they have all the products they need to complete the project and writing the order up.  Processing the payment, applying for credit, resolving customer issues."
bad,"The job was a bit lacking in terms of communication along associates, but the benefits where decent."
bad,"If you want a fantastic part-time position, Home Depot is the place to be.  Part-time staff may set the day and hour availability and work a schedule they want. Good pay and bonus.  Holiday meals and employee activities  Full time personal must work long hours for low wages. No incentives for sales specialists. Flat hourly rate no matter how much you sell. Managers do not have MBAs or advanced business training. No employee discounts."
bad,I got thousands of hours of customer service and sales training here. THD is very customer service oriented however pay raises having enough people on the floor to do your job was very poor. They give you everything you need to learn how to sell and treat customers and getting promoted was not that hard however once you get to the upper teens in hourly pay (15.00-18.00) an hour getting a decent raise was next to impossible. Even if you get the best review possible they are always cutting raise potential and cutting hours and people on the floor to a skeleton crew so getting work done as a manager was very difficult at times. I really enjoyed the training and atmosphere it was always comfortable and I learned everything I could possibly imagine to sell and service to customers. Overall a great company for you to start at when your young and just getting started in the work market.
bad,"Poor Managment, Low salary.They treat their employees with great disrespect."
bad,"Communication was not the greatest between management and staff"
bad,"Poor payroll left employees overworked and stressed and run-down, and left the customers waiting endlessly for assistance. Can't say you're about customer service and only have 5 people in the entire store."
bad,"Management isn't the best. "
bad,"Came to work, made coffee, cleaned departments sometimes ones other than my own. Handled taking care of deliveries, loading or unloading trucks from different companies, spoke with customers/contractors in person or over the phone about their orders and deliveries. Rushed to meet deadlines if necessary. Continueously standing, walking, running, bending, kneeling, holding, climbing, driving, wrapping, etc and sometimes 2 or more of those at the same time. Lifted up to but not limited to 200lbs from overheads, floors, aisle or vehicles by hand most of the time without help. Filed paperwork, set up transfers and deliveries, quantied out orders as needed and maintained a great attitude towards customers and management and assisted them when I was done with everything else. I learned so much here, which is the only good part. I've learned about roofing, flooring, drywall, painting, electrical, freight, receiving, sales, services and so much more. I also received both my forklift licenses here and my order picker license. Most co-workers were fun to be around but majority of them did almost no work compared to me and a few others and took credit for others work. Hardest part of the job was probaby the fact that salespeople would sell huge deliveries and promise they would be delivered the next day after I had already left work. Then the next morning I'd be expected to get them done by a random deadline ranging anywhere between 6am and 6pm by myself most of the time. I'd also add I did it rather well and never missed a deadline because I'm an extemely hard and fast worker. I learned"
bad,"Home Depot is a customer driven culture. There are always new and different ways to try to meet these needs in the home improvement industry. I learned many things about customer service, management, shipping and receiving, as well as contractor sales. Most of my co workers were new and young so there was a lot of training involved but we always found ways to make learning fun and informative. The hardest part of my job was time management. There was never enough time to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of my job was customer service. I built strong bonds with the contractors over the years."
bad,"I worked in the lumber portion of the warehouse and drove forklift, job was fun got to help a lot of customers and employees were great but most management was poor"
bad,"Come in to work, walk the floor, create an agenda for the day. Lots of lifting and heavy work, as well as driving equipment to ensure that the department stays clean and organized. Directed associates to help, set both personal and business goals with associates, helped them achieve them. Learned a lot about retail management, and how to plan for sales, ordering, goal setting. Management is alright, unless they deem that you're not worth it. It's an obvious favoritism. Some people can get away with 23 schedule occurrences, where as others are not so lucky. HR doesn't know what they're doing (Even within 90 days they have to go through the discipline process.)"
bad,If you begin to work their the people are the ones that will keep you there everyone is just trying get by with what they can management is poor always just throwing authority around.
bad,No chance for advancement or transfer.  Work with great co-workers over the past four years but there is nowhere to go.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was operating the forklifts and un loading the trailers. "
bad,"I worked in the Garden section of the home depot. My daily tasks included making sure items on the shelves were all stocked and no empty spaces were found (Where the items should be), ensuring that the outside garden department was fully stocked and clean. (Which includes driving the forklift and bringing in pallets of soils, mulches and manure and cleaning the entire area. Afterwards, customer service is our number one priority, which includes having knowledge about the products in garden in order to provide advice to customers with questions about their lawn and garden. We also have to provide assistance loading heavy merchandise into the vehicles of customers who cannot help themselves."
bad,"Facilitate home services to our customers; Build, manage and facilitate an active and diverse community of Service Professionals across many trades. Serve as a sales and customer support expert. "
bad,"some days as loaders,you come in to almost empty lanes and really nothing to do,sometimes 2-3 hrs.they tell you to drive and help other associates with work but the truth is, and what management seem to really not care about,is everyone doesn't have work.""""BUT"""" at the same time you're responsible to load x amount of pallets per hour,HOW ? when there's nothing to do!! co workers are really cool,hardest part of the day is staying busy(and that or 10 hrs).cant wait for breaks !!"
bad,"The company has good benefits and good chances to advance. The work life balance is horrible, you are expected to work loads and loads of hours, often with little time in-between shifts and to change your schedule at a drop of a hat. Also, maintaining a job in a higher level of management is incredibly difficult and many managers leave before they have been with the company on that positions for more than 3-4 years."
bad,"I did not enjoy working there, management was always looming overhead and the threat of being fired was very prevalent. My co-workers were generally friendly and most were a pleasure to work with. I began working there with a basic knowledge and background in flooring, doors and windows. The hardest part of the job was how heavy all the materials were. A typical day consisted of bringing inventory from the overheads to the floor, merchandising that inventory, and handling customer service."
bad,"I enjoy interacting with the customers.  Management is lacking in organization.  Like most jobs, you have some people who work hard and some who are just skating along."
bad,worst place to work if you wanna make money. they start you off making 10.75 and give u a .30 cent raise a year. and dept heads only make 12.00 a hour. i been there for 5 years and i make 11.75
bad,The company was overall good to work for when I began but at the time I left it was no longer the employee centered business I had enjoyed working for in the beginning
bad,"Store was not living up to company expectations, management was stressed. Job security is a complete unknown. Management would call on my days off assigning work."
bad,good job if u like home improvement but not much room to grow as far as job improvment
bad,"There are a lot of employees that have to work all hours of the day and week. Everyone likes to talk and start rumors. I wrote schedules for 185 associates, helped them with their training, hired people set up interviews, terminated associates, made sure everything was going alright with all the associates, and everything in-between"
bad,I learned to help people when  they need it and that keeping a clean work environment is better to attract people to your company. the management wasn't as nice as I would have liked. my co-workers all got along and helped one another to complete jobs. the hardest part of my job was lifting heavy items for people constantly. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping people.
bad,Good work experience. Good place for first time employees.
bad,"When I first started working at Home Depot, I felt like it was a great company to work for. The longer I was employed with Home Depot, the less excited I became. Even though I met some great people during my time of employment, I am thankful that I am not employed with Home Depot anymore. I did stay with the company for 3 years, but that was because I could not find a different job during my time of employment. The management staff that I was under seemed like they were only there to better themselves and they did not show much interest in the wellness of their employees."
bad,"A typical day involves receiving the freight on on a truck or trucks full of mixed palletized freight.  "
bad,The  company  had  its  hey-day  but  Bob  Nardelli  took  an  enormous  salary  and  ran.  While  I  was  there  working  staff  hours  were  cut  and  costs  were  minimized.  Customer  service  suffered  and  managers  came  and  went. But  fortunately  Home  Depot's  image  preceded  itself.  The  particular  location  I  was  at  could  be  at  times  like  a  ghost  town  during  off  hours  in  terms  of  staffing  but  management  still  passed  the  buck  when  things  went  wrong.  Given  the  QE  which  stabilized  the  economy  until  2013  and  the  subsequent  stock  market performance Home  Depot  probably  bought  back  their  own  stock  which  they  sold  during  the  down  time.  I  do  find  that  other  locations  are  much  better  staffed  now.  For  a  company  that  claimed  to  put  the  customer  first  they  were  really  hypocritical  for  a  while  but  maybe  they  will  continue  their  current  more  positive  trend
bad,"I worked in night freight dept.I had the opportunity to operate various types of equipment which included forklifts, reach trucks,orderpickers,electric pallet jacks etc.I was a part-time associate which worked out for me at the time,to go along with my lawn business.I also got to meet a lot of people from different cultures.The manager of the store was really good and very understanding when I had to leave to find a full-time job with benefits,and job advancement opportunities.One of the things I liked most about the job was I was always doing different things and meeting different people.I really got along with my coworkers and miss them."
bad,There is a huge emphasis on customer service in the Home Depot culture.  Great working environment/ awesome associates. Not for those who aren't used to working physically hard or dealing with difficult customers and managers. Good opportunity to learn about different departments and projects.
bad,"typical day at work: angry customers, no associates in my departments no support from upper management"
bad,"Raises are very small, even when you really work hard, you are not really noticed. There are plenty of directions you can go, which is a plus. Scheduling was not very disciplined."
bad,great learning center. the hardest part of the job is having to stop customers from monopolizing your time. having fun seeing your customer come back and thank you and ask for your help on another project.
bad,if you need a good job for just a short period of time then home depot is the place for you but if your looking for a long term career you might want to find another  place to work. the people i worked with were great people.
bad,"Customer service, lot attendant and customer sales. Learned sales, cash handling. and knowledge of products in store. Management was busy, and lifting heavy products without assistance was difficult. Enjoyed the alertness needed to do many different jobs, and conditioning for heavy lifting."
bad,Helped me learn about home improvements which very critical for me.
bad,"It's a good starting job, but it's best to keep your head down and get on with the job. Co workers are great and the values would be great if applied with care."
bad,"When I started working at the Home Depot Center it was great. I was working every week but as time went on I was getting less work. Then I was only looking forward to work for the summer months June, July, and August. All the other months I was lucking if I even got called."
bad,Getting to be a bad place to be. Hiring only part time associates and making older workers leave because they make too much money.
bad,I really would have to say they weren't good people or understanding
bad,Just worked here because i couldnt find anywhere else on that island to work for and needed a job...Was not excited about it.
bad,"Merchandise team as a clerk sound cool but generally speaking you are cleaners of all the products in the racks or shelves. Typical job is to jot down all you have found missing, dents, sorting, cleaning the racks, straighten all products in the shelf etcetera etc. and must be recorded in the reports card."
bad,a job no more no less just do ur job and everthing will be fine managers were rude co-worker were old so no conversation
bad,"I learned you must show your fellow workers respect and show them and tell them how much you appreciate their hard work. Some days are long and stressful. Many starting at 2:00am and ending at 6:00 pm with no brakes and no lunch so you must take care of each other.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer find an answer or way to take a project from planning to WOW.  To see a customer smile and say ""Thank You for all your help in getting me through this project"" that just made the day worthwhile."
bad,employees treated poorly.  Scheduling was a mess and having hours cut left and right make it hard to make ends meet and to maintain a second/other job.
bad,"Busy make time fly"
bad,"I enjoyed working here, however there is no organization in management, inconsistent schedule and no communication between departments. most co-workers aren't in a team mindset. Although individuals are assigned to certain department, there is no order in that company location.  "
bad,"Can't fully enjoy this job for many reasons.Store management unfairly treat associates( payroll ,advancement ,personal preferences)."
bad,"Busy fast paced environment always many things to accomplish and customers to serve. Learned good time management skills; excellent at delegating to associates; learned employee evaluations and reviews; Inventory Management; Asset Protection and Safety."
bad,Learned a lot about home improvement and how to operate several pieces of heavy machinery.
bad,"Not too many enjoyable parts to say about employment at Home Depot.  One manager will have you do some project one day, and then the next night's manager on duty will have you take it down."
bad,If your looking for something to do then just apply at the Home Depot. The co-workers were the best part of the job and sometimes customers.Management could be better and needs work.Everyone is for themselves. 
bad,"homedepot is a company where the management is all about their careers and jobs they couldn't care less about the other associates below them. I left cause as a supervisor my manager told me to right someone up for a small mistake every chance I could or my job would be on the line. let me tell you I was fired because I didn't right a mother up who called out do to a sick child, this mother never called out or was ever late. SOME COMPANY"
bad,"managment not professional at all, too much drama, cashiers are really bad "
bad,"good place to start, you learn alot, hard work, enjoyable coworkers"
bad,"Typical day is making sure all follow-up calls are done. Emphasis placed on pushing store CC, different programs, and upselling.  Often required to cover more than one department on the sales floor. Must do a lot of extra tasks, ie merchandising, cleaning, down stocking, which left little time to actually assist customer which is what I thought my main job was.  Raises were once a year and ranged from .10 to .35 . Offered full benefits that were expensive and not that great.  Company slogan is ""take care of associates and the rest will take care of itself"" is not really followed. A lot of favoritism with upper management.  If you can tolerate all the BS.and the bad hours,  it's a good place to work"
bad,• Responsible for counting money in cash drawers to make sure the correction of amount.
bad,"I was an associate of Home Depot for 6 years. Ther is room for promotion if you know the right people. Very seldom did I see someone qualified being promoted just because of their qualifications. HD is supposed to possess a family value base, which is not very true. You have to be fully flexible to attain most ft positions. With the schedule you must adhere to there is not very much room for a family or social life."
bad,"When I started working in the distribution center I can say everything was great, loved all of it until management changed. Then I started getting harassed by upper management, threats with my job. Had rumor started about myself that could have caused me to lose my job and HR did nothing to stop it or find its source. You bust your butt and give your all only to be fired for a mistake, no warning just as soon as you clock in they walk you out"
bad,"Little pay results in rapid employee turnover. No benefits, difficult to advancement. Hardest part of the job was doing more work with less pay. Management had favorites and they made it known."
bad,"It was Good In The Beginning, When They Set Standards , And Understood When You Didnt Make Standard Due To Variables, Such As Vendors Using Your Computer, And/Or Overstock Not Placed In The Correct Row. After being There A Couple Months, The Expectations Change, And They Totally Change The Way They Rate Their Standards. By Doing This, I Was Unable To Meet Standards, And I Was Told I Was Not Cooperative With Vendors, And Later Let Go. Not A Very Good Management Staff, And Poor Expectations."
bad,"I work very hard in taking care of my customers and think i'm going to get a raise after 1 year only to find out that the front end supervisor we ""had"" made it so I didn't get my yearly raise. They want you to go above and beyond but you get nothing in return. I have good co-workers but they're a bunch of brown nosers. The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers. The hardest part of the job is the favoratism and the front end supervisor being more of a friend than a supervisor. The pay is very bad at 8.00 an hour considering I have about 25 years cash handling experience."
bad,Working at Home Depot as a woman was like signing up for a slot in hell. Some of the most sexist people to walk this earth work/shop there. And management looks for small things to let people go.
bad,"A typical day at Home Depot starts with a flurry of activity, mostly trying to catch up to a memo or instructions issued three days past."
bad,"The Home Depot may be a great place to work however the store I work at has poor management, cliques between managers and associates and poor training and communication standards. Every one is out for themselves even though they say its team depot and the ones who do care about the customers and the store are left in the dust by the people who want to fast track to the easy life of management."
bad,"Days started out quiet and became hectic very quickly, with customers always working on projects at home coming in with many questions about them, and on rare occasions clinics about a certain project or product were held for one to two hours and hosted by me or a fellow department assistant, with customers attending those clinics to take notes and learn new and unique home improvement techniques; much of my time with the Home Depot was in the electrical department, so much was learned about a wide range of electrical products, from wiring receptacles, to lights, to ceiling fans, and a lot was focused on customer's remodeling of their homes so a lot was learned about custom as well as non-custom merchandise in the electrical department; management was reliable and friendly; fellow employees were friendly and helpful; the most challenging feature of The Home Depot was my transfer to plumbing supplies, because a lot of my previous experience was in electrical dating back to grade school and learning from my dad, it seemed learning about a whole new field was daunting to say the least, plumbing is one of the largest departments in the store, covering kitchens and cabinets, many different pipes and sizes, faucets, showers, and sink designs, not to mention plumbing is part a specialty department as well as hardlines; looking forward to all challenges as great learning opportunities was always an inspiring thing to me, and The Home Depot certainly had its share of obstacles during my tenure as an associate there"
bad,Typical day at home depot starts for me in the parking lot. I either get out of my car and pick up some trash that is left in the parking lot or I grab a few shopping carts astray out in the lot. I punch in and say hello to my fellow co-workers passing by. I seek out customers on my way to the appliance/ kitchen and bath isles. Sometimes it takes a good 1/2 hour to 45 minutes until I get into my department but not always. You can usually find me helping in teaching customers about various things. I love the people I work with and enjoy working with them. Im a team player so usually this happens where ever I work. I love that Im able to work in multiple departments and I learn something new everyday at work.
bad,The first thing I found out is all Home Depots are not the same.
bad,"Home Depot has excellent values. However, their company does not manage very well. No one can actually live on 17 hours of work per week."
bad,"It was an ok job learned alot people help you good, The training was fast an easy you got your break time when you were suppose to management was nice and helpful they just didn't give a lot of hours due to down time in business"
bad,"It is truly a workplace where the workload is not worth the compensation. A place where a person who works hard is rarely rewarded, but those who stand around and do very little, seem to always receive any awards."
bad,"It was a great work experience while it lasted. At times the store was ran the right way as it should have been. Also, being that it is a multi-million dollar business."
bad,process payroll on a daily basis and provide assistance with minor HR related issues for the home depot warehouse and store location's.
bad,On a typical day at work I am a cashier working the returns desk or customer service. I answer phones and assist customers with any issues they may have with things such as a customer agreements or a product they was dissatisfied with. I learned how to be patient and understanding. I've been at different locations and i've seen management come and go the best management is one who leads by example. The hardest part of my job may be dealing with uncooperative customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i have helped resolved customers issues and they're leaving happy.
bad,"Good with giving time off for emergencies, not good with prioritizing. Good behavior is recognized, yet not taken into consideration for promotion"
bad,Decent job. Decent enviornment. Managers weren't the best though.
bad,A typical day of work would be dealing with customers as far as directing them where to items were grettin them first and foremost and being as helpful as i can to the customer. I learned alot about how to respond to customers objections and to work with them to make something happen. Management was always trying to bring up sales as far as presentation of the store and ads which is perfect but always were very pushy and would overwork their employees. My coworkers should be helpful sometimes weren't so Im definetly used to picking up the slack from time to time. Hardest part of my job was seeing the corruption and not being able to do anything about it day by day. the most enjoyable part of the job was people were humble and always took care of one another as far as the bottom of the chain.
bad,"On a typical day of work, i learned that management and coworkers could come together for the hardest part of the job and turn it into the most enjoyable part of the job. P.S. Don't show up on big swell day, dey wont fire ya!"
bad,"Home Depot brings you in touch with many people, walks of life. The good part is that it can be an enjoyable place to work, given the right management, For 10 of my 15 years, I enjoyed it thoroughly, even the crazy hours, the heavy lifting, pressure from upper management. However, they have lost key element of a positive place to work. Which is communication, compassion towards their people."
bad,If you do not like to spend time with your family you will love it.
bad,"Great place to work but if you need hours they are barely there due to the amount of full-time associates. If you want to move up in the company, it is impossible at store 1915 also because of this. If you are in high school or you need a under 20 hours a week. this job is for you. (IN THIS LOCATION ONLY) Management is a 50/50. While few will talk to you and be reasonable, the other few can be unprofessional, not talkative, and form something similar to a high school Clique."
bad,"Retail is retail,district staff horrible,if they don't like you your gone.work million hours,never see light at end of tunnel. Always feel like like your chasing your tail as a Mgr,always short staffed."
bad,"Home Depot was a great place to work at, I loved the atmosphere, the people everything. The pay wasn't too shabby, and the benefits were fantastic. I really did enjoy it. The only thing that lead me to quit was their inability to work with my school schedule. I told them when they hired me when I couldn't work due to school, and they adamantly continued to schedule me during the times I had classes. I'd call and talk to whoever I could, and they'd apologize, but the next week it was exactly the same thing. I filled out at least 20 different availability forms all saying the exact same thing, left notes with the HR chick, the store director, etc. Nothing changed. I finally gave them my two weeks, and when I came in to get my last check, no one even knew I had quit, the HR lady forgot to document that I had quit, so they inevitably fired me for not showing up."
bad,"My manager, sat on his tail while I worked. I was moved into lumber since I out worked my low productive counterparts in Garden and continued to out work almost everyone! We all know how slack Home Depo is, get over it!"
bad,"Associates always hiding somewhere to don't help customer, and only associates who's had friendship with managers get promoted and get awards."
bad,You have to be a very sociable person and able to explain detailed information about products customers are seeking. Helping customers with products to their vehicles etc.
bad,"This company boasts team attitude, however if you are not on the ""right"" team, forget it. Management is horrible and so is important store communication, gossip get's around faster than anything company related. Also, if you are looking for a transfer in company forget it, it won't happen and you have to do all the leg work VS HR doing it."
bad,As an entry level door monitor it is very difficult to get promoted to an actual Loss prevention agent. They are really good with working with your schedule and giving you full time status. I would suggest to anyone looking to work there to possibly look at working in another department.
bad,"The managers walked around like they’re on top of the world and couldn’t help anyone. They didn’t make their employees their #1 priority. Most of the employees were old/ older which didn’t really bother me but the men made it uncomfortable. If the managers set up snack tables for appreciation to their employees, they would make a mess like 5 yr olds and leave it for the ladies that cleans our store throughout the day  Those were just a couple of complaints  Overall it was draining and miserable."
bad,The company values its hourly associates and does its best to give them opportunity to grow.  Work-Life balance is very low if you are a salaried member of the company.  People you work with are great.  Work environment swings from good to bad depending on SM/DM.
bad,"If you're looking for a part-time job as, say, a student, The Home Depot is excellent. They offer good pay for unskilled labor and are fairly flexible with scheduling hours."
bad,"Only work there if you have nowhere else to go to. I had gone in for a part time position because I'm in college. They bend the labor laws to their favors, they will give you 2 weeks of 32+ hours and the 3ed week theyll give you 24 hours so that they dont have to give you full time status and benefits. They say they respect school schedueles but they will not respect your college schedule, they will schedule you on top of your classes and then threaten to fire you over it"
bad,They use their employees and take advantage of the hard working with no incentive to promote. Promotions seem to occur solely from nepotism rather from those that have seniority or experience.  The culture is highly toxic and overly political. Entry level associates get treated with no respect.
bad,"Where i worked there was mass favoritism, If you weren't buddies with one of the managers you were very unlikely to move ahead within the company. The mostly higher part time and don't really allow for advancement."
bad,"Its starts off good but once you start working there the management is terrible.  The supervisor of freight overnight is very un-professional, like to start problems, and is very complicated"
bad,As a full time employee you are expected to work every holiday every weekend Work/family balance non existing.they do offer profit sharing a great part time job
bad,Management acts like they want to see you suceed and move up in the company but they dont follow through with what it takes to achieve that. Pay is very low.  I worked hard and received no acknowledgement for it.
bad,Did not give me the hours I was told sold be getting poorly managed . Very friendly coworkers ...great place for some one just entering the workforce.
bad,"Underpaid for the B.S. you have to deal with because your literally doing everyone's job. Management  is always on you about your job their but  they let supervisors do as they please. But because your a sales specialist ""your expected to do more.""  Trying to move up will only happen if you kiss a lot of butt and even then moving up is still a very slow process. Working there almost 4 years and I've never seen so many employees quit weeks after starting and makes me wonder how many employees does this company go through.  Genuinely amazed I've been there this long."
bad,I requested off for days for vacation. They scheduled me for three of those four days. After I reminded them both and writing and in person I was informed by the human resource lady that she would take care of it. I went on my trip. A week after I came back they informed me that I had 3 no-call no-show days and I was being wrote up.
bad,"Hardest part of the job, being a female, has to be the harrasment. So many older men and I started when I was 17. Also the are I lived in wasn't so great. The best part of working there is I made 2 extremely thoughtful friends. As a cashier, the management in the front end was horrible. So much favoritism. You can be doing your job and if your not the managers pet you get picked on."
bad,"Way to much favoritism, unfair job promotion practice, targeting associates, long work days, inconsistent days off.  If you are not the district manage or store manager pet watch your back."
bad,"Work part time and move to full time if you'd like and stay at the store level, but DO NOT express interest in Specialty, Management, or Asset Protection. You'll be sorry. The rules change. More scrutiny, more red tape, quotas, and less support. They will essentially throw you to the wolves and not protect you if something goes wrong. Their policy comes first DESPITE and completely the opposite of what they say."
bad,I have been working for a Couple months now and trust me they over work you with little in return for yourself. They do not see the skills or needs others have and follow a principle that sounds good but in reality it’s just to make the associates feel better it’s called the “inverted pyramid” where customers and associates are put “first” but are paid almost the bare minimum. It’s great as a first job but  if you stay there will be newer people that will get paid more than you with less experience.
bad,"When I first got hired on with The Home Depot I was fairly excite to come to work, after about a year in I realized how much this job just mentally drains you. It's like the longer you're here the less valued and the more stressed out you become. Wouldn't recommend working here. Management changes are common and most of them have no idea what they're doing. Have fun even finding anyone to help because half the time we are so understaffed it's ridiculous. Seriously think twice about yourself and financial status before choosing to apply. You won't be paid enough and the annual ""raises"" are a joke and slap in the face for all the hard work you'll be doing. Definitely not giving 100% to them  to just get 5% back."
bad,"For a retail chain, home depot pays pretty well. They offer benefit plans for employees that desire them, and they have a 401K plan with some percentage of matching. There's a ""bonus"" every six months (if the store qualifies based on metrics, and the amount of the bonus varies depending on sales), as well as an annual raise based on the employee's reviews. It's relatively easy to move around to different positions, some positions come with raises. All that being said it's not a terrible place to work as a second job, a job for people in school, or for retired people; however, it will drain the life out of you. I only worked there for 3 years and it felt like forever. The rate of attrition is super high pretty much constantly. Managers are usually mediocre and if by some stroke of luck there's a good one they usually end up getting moved. The customers are by far the worst part of the entire thing. There's no end to how stupid people can be, how much people will argue over super minute things (i.e. had people argue with me DAILY about a price that was ""off"" by mere cents, not kidding, CENTS. LIKE OKAY HERE SINCE OBVIOUSLY SIX PENNIES WILL MAKE OR BREAK YOU), and also people are just gross. So yeah it might be alright at the start, but as time goes on it will just make you misanthropic towards all of humanity."
bad,There is a disconnect between management and workers. Individually people are great! But there was not any flexibility for the schedule. Nor could management keep up with the level of customer service needed in store.
bad,Working here has been an absolutely amazing experience. I've bee here for 5 years now. Wow time sure does go by! I love this place they really make your feel like you're apart of a family.
bad,Hourly wage and earning potential is why HomeDepot has such a high turn over rate. Employees have to complete 3 months of training modules on the computers while working the floor. After completing the required modules some times you have to handle 2 to 3 departments at a time. None of this would of bothered me but making $10 an hour to do it was ridiculous. Also employees are hired as part time employees. In order to become full time you have to go through ANOTHER interview process. This I find again RIDICULOUS.  If these changes were to be implemented I would consider a long term commitment to Home Depot.
bad,company doesn't like to move you up in this company and if you wasn't hired in full time then your chances of getting it is 0 to none . overall not really a good company to work for  if wanting a good career
bad,Okay company but it does slow down after summer because your hours get cut and you would have to find a second job lucky if you work more that 2 days a week
bad,The company used to be amazing to work for until we got a new store manager who does not follow company’s core values and will penalize you if vocal about situations he does not want you too. And don’t call district hr you will be on a final within 30 days
bad,Todo está controlado por recursos humanos el crecimiento no te lo permiten más que sea de su agrado okay O sea que tengan en mente pero por resultados o por otros medios no puedes
bad,"After working there over 13 years and was told by a store manager to come back if the grass was not greener on the other side at any time.  I re-applied and called twice and no one gave me the courtesy of a call back.My sales were in excess of$750,000.00yr."
bad,This company does not pay well anymore. 20% of the people do 80% of the work. If you are a hard worker they will kill you while letting the lazy ones do nothing. Almost no overtime allowed. Always short staffed and forced to cover multiple departments. You can move up if you are a butt kisser so bring your chapstick.
bad,"A whole lot of training is given and little time is given to attend to the customers,It could get really busy sometimes but if you happen to have resourceful colleagues in your department the duties will be a delight."
bad,"It honestly sucked there & I would go back but that's only because of the customers and some of the coworkers. Management sucked they always put you down, then never made sure if you're okay. They always wanted work done and it done fast and perfectly and if you didn't do that then you got punished."
bad,"Management sucks , hours suck , co workers have bad attitudes, no store discounts they don’t accept doctors notes they randomly make schedules and change schedules last minute"
bad,"The pay for an associate is minimum wage, not enough for the amount of work expected from you. Managers can be great people but not great managers. Scheduling is a nightmare. Too many cost cutting measures that hurt associates and then cause issues for customers who then take their anger out on associates. Associates always lose. For example, they combine departments to save money on paying multiple people a Department Supervisor salary. They instead would consolidate a handful of departments into one so that there is only one DS rather than maybe 3. That means, however, that one or two associates are expected to cover all of those departments at some times during the day regardless of their knowledge and experience. Associates are spread too thin, paid too little, and made to work more than reasonably expected."
bad,"I was really excited to work there, I had heard a lot of good things. It turns out if you want to get paid well to work at THD you either have to work up to assistant store manager and basically live at the store or have started working there before 2010 or so when they gave real raises and paid better. They dont pay well, the raises top out at less than a dollar per year and there is no employee discount. If the employees dont want to go to management they usually leave and work for one of the vendors for more money less stress and less work."
bad,"managers show favoritism"
bad,At first I was very excited to work at Home Depot. But then grew incredibly frustrated at my management due to their favoritism at my location. Very nice people and customers were nice too.
bad,I enjoyed the environment and the way we were treated. We worked hard everyday and the supervisors noticed. They have a good move up process. They enjoy to teach you and get you certified
bad,Horrid management. Favouritism is a BIG thing. Worked there for over 2 years and noticed management favored the younger female employees and didn't really care about others.
bad,"If you are new to a job market The Home Depot is a decent place to find your bearings. As in any retail environment the forceforce is transient at best. There is always constant flux. Consequently you are forced to lift and shift into evolving roles. The work/ life balance is beyond terrible. Daily rotating schedules fprm 5a to 11p, M-F. Lesrn qhat you need and leave."
bad,"I have kids and could only work during normal school hours due to daycare, but they wouldn’t let me switch to normal hours, only 3 days a week 12 hour shifts. I also had car troubles toward the end of me working there and they had no grace."
bad,Be prepared to work with so many different things in an environment that shifts dramatically depending on season. Obviously you don't want to work on hot and humid days. And most of the night you're just doing busy work and cleaning up the store.
bad,"Very stressful and fast paced work environment; customers are complete jerks most times. You will be moved departments whether you want to be or not. Constant push for credit card applications. Managers and coworkers are at the very least empathetic at times, and management are willing to work around with scheduling. "
bad,"Working there at first was amazing, I had everything I was looking for in a job with all the benefits and fun people. Until it wasn't everything was turned to trash as time went on."
bad,The current management standards and ethics are poorly displayed outside of start-up meetings.  It is a company full of management clicks.  Do not expect to be treated the same standards and honesty as others.  Especially in the Maintenance dept under the current maintenance management.
bad,"Management does not hold employees accountable for not get things done. It's like having to baby a bunch of kids. It's a billion dollar company, but the pay is not enough. If you are lucky enough to get promoted, they let the department heads do very little to help. You can make more flipping burgers or washing dishes. Cheap pay and long time for career advancement."
bad,"Not my favorite job. I loved the work and the customers always came back to see me. You can build lasting relationships with your co-workers and they are willing to move you up the ladder. But, the management team at sore 1519 is trash."
bad,There is a ton of turnover. Constantly new people being hired.  If you aren't full time you aren't guaranteed any hours.  Management at the time I worked there was not understanding of personal issues and needs.  I loved the team I worked with but there wasn't good room for advancement unless you wanted to work at a different store.
bad,They do not make good choices on hiring/hours. They hire to many people and then have no hours to give them. They don't respect their workers. They let customers disrespect and humiliate the employees.
bad,"Management is terrible. They play favorites. They have no organization. One week you could get decent hours the next you would get one day a week. The other associates are rude, unhelpful. I’ve had to apologize so many times to customers for our rude and unprofessional associates even when the customer was being nice. Too much gossip, and associates spreading rumors about other associates. Would not recommend."
bad,It is a difficult place to work just based on the physical requirements of the job.  There is very little support from Management and work hours are never dependable.
bad,"I started out as a seasonal garden associate and stayed on as a part time associate."
bad,"Positives:"
bad,"When I applied I got hired for a completely different section than we discussed, they never seem to hire full time on the spot with no idea if you will get promoted. In my first weeks I didn’t have much hands on training had to learn on my own, managers look down on you. I had 4 store managers 2 were a charm to work with the other 2 would follow everyone asking howling they have left for break , what they are doing , just a pain to work with , would get yelled at even when off the clock , when I had enough I quit , one of them was pretty aggressive after that. My schedule was horribly managed , since everyone is part time they don’t really care , my hours went down to 12 a week until hitting 4 a week , had to quit on the spot after me it seems 8 more associates followed and quit . You don’t get paid extra for leading the machines or unloading trucks ,."
bad,"Schedules are unpredictable and many associates are unhappy working there.  Associates rarely get feedback on successes, failures and expectations.  Nevertheless, customers on average have a good experience."
bad,Manager didn’t really care of employees but more of him self  didn’t really like being asked questions or being called out when a customer needed his assistance. Rude and disrespectful at times
bad,"I was excited to work at HD since it would fit with my schedule but increasingly became disappointed. The management was poor as in quality of people in charge of the night crew. There was a theme of holding the 1st crew responsible for the 2nd + 3rd crews position.The managers seemed to think the night crew members were irreplaceable. Which is laughable any college kid or single parent would love those jobs. There was a lot of drooling over the cashier who were underage. One night crew manager insisted on hitting on all the girls and would make working uncomfortable for them if they werent reciprocating. This manager was married with children. Wonderful. "
bad,Not enough employees to properly maintain store and help customers. Employees asked to do to much. The people willing to work have to carry and cover for the majority who do not.
bad,"The Home Depot is a fun place to work if you can stay out of politics that affect each department.   If you are an hourly associate, you will be golden.  Salaried leaders are treated poorly and often subjected to profane and unprofessional communications from Directors.  Hourly associate control the power and HR will defend the associate before consulting with the leadership.  Associates can walk off the job after 8 hrs, even if the job isn't complete, leaving customers with unfulfilled orders.  There is no repercussion for this practice."
bad,"When I worked at Home Depot Measurement services, they were transitioning from Measurecomp to Home Depot Measurement Services, at that time a lot of things weren't in order, a lot of unorganized management and unknowledgeable leaders. This is a great first call center job for someone transitioning into the call center field."
bad,"I was hired as what more or less amounted to a ""pilot program"" in which it was my job to build a market from scratch in the San Jose, CA area. My direct supervisor basically became my supervisor by default and had little to no experience in managing salaried employees (myself) but 15 plus years managing commision only salespeople. This led to a nightmarish blend of forcing us to follow the rules by the book in cases that it supported his ideas while disregarding parts of the contract that didn't mesh with straight commision mentality."
bad,It was a fast paste busy environment. A lot of moving and moving objects that customers desire. Customer service was apart of the job duties. Working through most weather conditions.
bad,You give terrible hours thats why they’re always hiring. Super hard to become full time and when you do you can get as low as 30 hrs. Part timers wont get more than 30 they don’t even like them going over 25 hours!!
bad,In my time with the Home Depot I found that management was lacking in their abilities. They were more focused on themselves instead of their work. As a result they end up doing more harm than good in their practices.
bad,"Managers are incompetent. Pay is extremely unfair. Customers are rude, coworkers are rude and most are poorly trained, because of poor management. Do not recommend."
bad,This job was temp for me. Mostly for young teens/adults who start off as their first job. They will cut hours in the winter to save money but hire like crazy in the spring time since that is when they make the most business.
bad,"Expectations were beyond what the store management was willing to support.  Our piece of installed services was seen as the unwanted child.  Recently, the dropped several installed services programs in their Exterior Services."
bad,"The work environment of the Home Depot was satisfactory at best, other coworkers of your standing were always nice and helpful, and almost always would do what they could to assist you if needbe. Management, on the other hand, left much to be desired. Managers didn't seem to have any desire to connect with their employees and more times than not couldn't even be found in the store. The hiring process seemed wrong to me, as, instead of honoring veteran employees or giving pay raises, my personal experience I saw most being fired to make room for new employees at a lower wage. "
bad,"I would get to work, usually a bit early. Checked in and walked over to the registers, it took the head cashier at least 5 minutes to tell me what register I was going to go to. Not even that but since I was new, my first week there, she put me in a register still not knowing what I was doing and with no training. Left me there to do it by myself and another employee helped me and finally told me to get off the register. Once I was a bit trained, I came into work one morning and had no idea that I needed to scan a paper under a piece of machine for verification of merchandise purchased, the computer was stuck until I scanned the paper but I didn't know how to do it, so I called the head cashier to help and she said to wait. I waited 15 minutes and no help, I had at least 10 people in my line. I was the only register opened at that time. Management didn't care about the issue. The hardest part was dealing with the head cashiers who clearly didn't care that a new person wasn't trained and I left them to figure it out on their own creating a bad experience for the costumer."
bad,"The Home Depot is a great place to work, ive met co-workers that have become great friends. The management there is next to none, all of them have favorites and makes work seem unfair."
bad,Having worked as a handy man for a period of time home Depot seemed to be a natural progression but it seemed to be a lot of work for very little money and not much appreciation
bad,"Management sucks. They pick and choose when they want to follow the Rules of Conducts depending on if they like the associate or not. They can be very catty and unprofessional when dealing with associate issues. Its almost actually its exactly like being in High School, but with adults. You don't really get recognized for the good work you do there unless your one of the favorites. The company is great and everything they stand for, but the people they choose to manage their company is TERRIBLEEEEE only if the ""President of Home Depot"" could witness the way the company stores are being managed he/she would not be pleased. They also, pick and choose how many hours a week they want to give you regardless of what you availability is says. The computer generates the hours/schedule and most of the time they do not look over it to make sure it makes sense (Coverage in all departments, Lunch coverage) until you come to them and complain about your hours personally."
bad,go work and go home.learned something new sometime.Management does not have good communication. Management always complain. we always wrong. always talk about numbers that need to be done.
bad,After years of working there I have come to the final conclusion that this is a bad company to work for. There is a low level of compensation for hard work. The pressure to produce credit cards for both every day consumers and contractors or businesses is relentless. There is absolutely NO PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE GIVEN for outstanding production in such. The words Corporate Greed come to mind.
bad,"you have to be a very quick, hardest part of the job is the work model customer always right. I came across all types of people, always on your toes and being a quick thinker."
bad,"Typical day at work: ""Anything Can Happen"""
bad,I worked at multiple stores.  The management is not trained and there is a lot of politics.  The basic job comes down to the relationship that you establish with your supervisor and how well you play the game.  Sad.
bad,"You can definitely advance as far as going up the ladder but its with hard work for months and it often gets overlooked unless they need a new department head. After that you get a raise of $1 for 4x the stress and work load. The dress code is so strict but they provide no uniforms except one polo shirt you get free and everything else you have to buy yourself. I mean its good if you want some change in your pocket or studying full-time in college but besides that there's not much here. The tuition reimbursement is only for people who are business majors that can benefit the company or Kitchen and Bath association trainees. After the Spring and Winter seasons die down you get little to no hours if you're part time but they mainly hire part- time so they can throw you anywhere  on the schedule. Most people who work here have a second job or just need something to do. The employees are the last considered and the customers get everything. If you need some change, spending money or enjoy having customers tell you want to do and watch the managers do anything to please them, then by all means its the place for you."
bad,"from having to greet every customer to the physical labor they ask you to do for the amount they pay you. and their sick leave rules are pretty harsh. even if its a emergency.  I haven't work such a physically demanding job sense i worked there, and i get paid better."
bad,Empresa con horarios los cuales i terfieren con tu vida social y familiar
bad,"If I had to describe my experience working at the Home Depot in one word, I would say it was very stressful. I worked during the summer which is the busiest time of the year. One of the head cashiers was really rude, criticized me on everything I did, like not standing the right way, or asking my co-worker a question about the price of a product. The managers were nice, always helpful. People would call out every day so we were always very understaffed, and the customers would take their anger out on you when they couldn’t get their questions answered due to lack of help. My schedule was very irregular, I could work 5 hours one week and 32 the next. Co-workers were great, the best part about working here."
bad,"What HD ""promised"" in the recruiting material AND in my Orientation was, well: 90% Blather."
bad,"This is a great job for part timers and older people that have already retired from a job but still want to work full time. Do not take a dept supervisor promotion. No longer will the job be about customers but instead about sales, work lists, CREDIT GOALS! and other profit and sales garbage. This company cares more about getting a credit card then making 10 customers happy. Work here to kill time, do not make it a career."
bad,"I wouldn't mind working there if they would give me enough hours to pay rent, but they don't. Maybe if I made more than $11/hr, I could, but they said I would get 30-40 hours and I have had less than 20 hours on the schedule for the past 2 weeks. I will be homeless soon, if I don't find another job."
bad,I enjoyed working at Home Depot but due to the poor management and poor pay is the reason I would like to leave. Overall it is not a terrible place to work but is no career!
bad,"when I started at Home Depot, I really liked it. Sure it was retail, but it was a good place. But once new management came in, the whole mood in the store changed. Managers were more distant, and the team feeling was gone. The fun of the job was gone, and even customers could start to see it."
bad,Chaotic mostly seasonal and specialty home improvement retail environment that is very physically demanding and under poor store manager in the location where I worked.
bad,"These managers and supervisors did not care about the employees, it was disturbing the amount of favoritism played a part within this company. Personally I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Most customers were pleasant and patient; of course there were a few who were frustrating to work with. "
bad,"You either have to be quite to learn, or just willing to admit you don’t know and don’t want to learn to anything. And if you do know how to do your job, the wild environment requires you to do the job of at least five people. At the service desk, I could be processing a return on one register, processing a sale on the other, and then at the computers I could be setting up an order for somebody, all while answering the phone to some impossible to answer question and directing lost costumers to where they need to go (and still have 2 other people with me staring off into space). The associates (the ones who put it work) are incredibly undervalued, only getting paid the bare minimum with no raises until a year in, and even that raise is by a few cents. They like to milk their part time people as well bc technically they can’t give overtime to somebody who isn’t working 40 hours. You could be part time, with no benefits like the limited healthcare (only dental and vision) and the extra sick time etc, but work the same amount of hours as somebody full time because there isn’t a labor law that defines what part time is."
bad,"Buena, el subir de puesto a raíz de mi esfuerzo sin ayuda"
bad,I am a developmentally disabled adult and I was not treated fairly at Home Depot. They have very little tolerance and I believe they were looking for a reason to let me go.
bad,"It was a terrible place to work.  The work load was not evenly distributed.  If you were a hard worker you were penalized because you were expected to complete the work of the less efficient lazy workers,  As the starting pay level was increased, the level of the employees with longer service with the company was not increased to compensate for the differences in starting pay.  All I can say is, "" In my opinion, it is a really terrible company to work for."""
bad,"It’s retail. Hours are terrible and inconsistent. You may work mornings, afternoons, or nights, and probably all three in the same week. Also expect to work weekends. Other than the schedule not a terrible place to work."
bad,"The Pay is acceptable but they overwork you and make you do things that are technically not your job. There is absolutely no advancement no matter how hard you prove yourself unless you either kiss up or are a favorite. THERE IS NO ""OPEN DOOR POLICY"" you go up to them confidentially to express concerns and stuff and the whole store will find out and go against you. You're forced to convince people to sign up for their high interest credit cards and they even tell you to focus more on older people and those with language barriers. They dont care if you"
bad,"My time at home depot was not great. Mostly terrible managers, poor training, and poor compensation. Only would recommend if you can't find something better."
bad,"Like someone else mentioned this company is good for retired people and students who just want something temporary until they graduate. "
bad,I cut carpet/ blinds and help customers. I stock and clean areas. I do orders for customers on the computer. I offer sales such as credit cards different ones.
bad,"Management says flexible work schedules, but they are not. Horrible sick pay. 4 hours per month if full time and 2 hours a month if part time. Poor annual raises and poor training!"
bad,"The managers there have attitudes as if you're bothering them when you come to them to do their job. People who work there are lazy and also have attitudes when you come to them to simply ask them a question in their department or something that they are getting paid to do. Not everyone though. A lot of people who work there are messy and are all about drama including the department supervisors. The vibe there is toxic and the customers who come in there are all entitled to get whatever they want, whenever they want. You tell them the policy, they'll ask for a manger, a manager then comes and just overrides the policy and will do whatever it takes to satisfy that customer and any other customer. Forget the policy! There is no policy. At least at 0881 it isn't! The people you work with don't want to learn anything you teach them. It's a waste of time trying to teach them. All they want to do is sit up there on their phones on social media and talk about the gossip in the store. They just put bodies up there in the departments just to have people in the departments. All they do is just send the customer off to the next person so that they don't have to help them. At this point, to keep my sanity, it's time for me to part ways from this place. I know that there is people at every job that you're not going to vibe with, but the vibe there is heavily toxic and it makes it uncomfortable to work there and gets annoying to have to feel and deal with each and every day I go to work. It's NOT the job at all, it's the people who work there and the toxic energy they bring into the workplace."
bad,"I can't speak for all Hope Depot's but the one that i work at is awful. The management does not hold anyone accountable for their actions. Recognition for the people who deserve it is non-existent. Promotions seem to only go to a certain group of people. Home Depot as a whole does not seem to be keeping up with cost of living adjustments. Raises are small and you have no opportunity to receive a raise other then annually. The ""bonus"" checks you get bi-annually are a slap in the face for the hard work you've put in.  Home Depot offers a lot in the benefits areas. The medical is a little pricey. Eye insurance is fantastic. They offer a 401k with a 3.5% company match, and stock options. They have a lot of resources for school/daycare/commuting/financial. Overall i think there are far better places out there that will offer more for your hard work and time."
bad,"Not accommodating when needing shift change to mornings, needed to be with my children at night and couldn't be there for the overnight shift, requested to change to morning and they couldn't do it because I was there for my shift when they knew exactly why."
bad,"My typical day at work was clocking in and then heading straight to the sales floor to help customers and then ring up their items. It was very boring and slow at times where I would just pace back and forth. The management at the first Home Depot I worked at was terrible and then the second Home Depot I worked for was a better for the most part. In terms of managers caring about you and your needs. The workplace culture was pretty good other than the groups which consisted a lot in every Home Depot. If you were new than you were pretty much a one man team. The hardest part of my job was getting help from other departments.Its like you would call over and over and over and no one would bother to come, then you get cussed out by the customers. Aside from that the most enjoyable part was getting off work and getting a check for all that time you worked."
bad,First days are fun and exciting to look forward too until the supervisors and managers show their true colors then you just hate showing up to work thinking you’re only their for the money and trying to stick thru it but it’s definitely not worth it
bad,"Lots of hard work, good people to work with, plenty to do. But the pay and schedule make it difficult to think of it as a great long term job. If you do stick it out, there are some decent benefits."
bad,Supervisors are promoted based on popularity rather than competency. This place promotes positive attitudes more than ability to do ones job and relies on the few workers who know the job to pick up the slack.  The HR team can't be trusted and the open door policy is a joke.
bad,"Home Depot is an excellent company with a culture that is both laudable and limiting at the same time. As a consultant I do not work in the stores but rather provide service in-home to exterior customers. It could be an outstanding job if management had the ability to make changes or even cared enough to stand up for their people. For example an HDE consultant in our area will drive 40,000 to 50,000 miles a year, with no mileage reimbursement and as a W2 employee the miles are no longer deductible. This cost the average rep about $10,000 a year in take-home pay. Did anyone make any changes to the compensation model to offset this, no. If you are in the right market this job can pay well into the six figure range. In the wrong area with bad construction management or slow installers it could literally break you."
bad,Decent place to work. Not many opportunities. Management is solely concerned about bonuses and promotions and utilizes the floor associates as tools to achieve this.
bad,"I was employed by the home depot distribution center in Van Buren, OH. I've been there about 7 months now and it's the worst job I have had. The benefits are terrible and the incentives are not enough to outweigh the cons. No holidays off except for Xmas and thanks giving, they don't give you any vacation time until you're there a full year, you get points which is nice, but you will need those points to recover from constant strains and injuries. Before starting here, I have worked at 4 different manufacturing companies. If you're a hard worker, you will feel alone as they are always riding you about doing better and better. They go by percentages to view how you are doing on the job. The standard they set is 95% and everyday I do over 120%. I am still made to do the hardest jobs while the lazy people get hand-outs, awards, and time to do whatever they want, while they rely on me to ""hit goal"". It's a joke and management says they'll do things to make our wants and needs meet, but it's not going to happen. I have a lot of experience in the industry and when i got hired in, they told me I was going to do a job that required more skill, but instead, was told I'm going to throw heavy boxes in a trailer for 10 hours straight."
bad,"There is no work life balance here.  Look elsewhere. This company has great people, but the core values are not practiced as much as other companies. Try another company."
bad,"A typical day at the Home Depot is working hard. And by working hard, I mean working hard to cover all the poorly staffed departments of the store. There will be countless times where no one is staffed for a department after a certain time of the day, or there will be several hour gaps in the schedule. During these times, it is expected that other associates will step in and cover these gaps. This is where your job comes in. You are expected to step into this department and help customers with their needs. Meanwhile, no one is now covering your department, which means everyone is upset with you for not being in your department when needed. You will be talked about behind your back, you will be scrutinized by managers and department heads (who have monthly meetings where they all nominate people who are not pulling their weight in the store) for not doing your job or poorly doing your job, because you are working hard trying to pick up the slack they have created. It is a lose-lose job at the Home Depot. There have been many times I go out of the way to help someone out, and I get backstabbed in the process by others. They also preach that there is room for growth and the famous ""This job can be anything you want it to be."" When training you, they make it seem like you could grow to CEO if that is what you really want out of this job. The obvious reality is that unless you are ""popular"" or kiss managements rear end in this store, your request to move up in the company will be thrown in the garbage. They place the people they want moving up where ever they please. Not once has"
bad,"The job as a merchandiser at The Home Depot isn't very difficult. What makes this job hard is getting up at 4 AM for a 5 AM shift, and only being compensated 11.00 per hour for it, as well as the awful annual raises (only 30 cents at the most), as well as the placating management culture. Management expresses care, but the actions they could actually do to show it in ways that genuinely matter long term are nowhere to be seen. This job teaches you to be a grunt, and encourages you to be okay and proud of it. If you lack ambition and appreciation for your labor value, this job is for you. Realistically, this job is also good for part-time college students."
bad,It was a fast paced place to work. Management was not the best you could be throwing up and they wouldn't let you go home. There were always departments that didn't have anyone in them.
bad,Its like the military....Never ever expect any of your great ideas to be implemented.  They do what they do....and you do what they say...or find another job.
bad,"Great culture has game area video ping pong pool table basketball."
bad,"This is a great company. All great companys have an achilles heel, this company's is the lack of motivation to work. Day in and day out routines are mundane and dull."
bad,I enjoyed learning the whole store and about the many departments there and learning to help the customers with many of their needs. I had to find another job in order to get them to seen my skills and advance there.
bad,"they are running a retail location as if it is a warehouse rather than a service oriented position like it used to be. pay raises are so low its comical and associates joke about how low their raises are and it doesn't  keep up with the cost of living at all. the infrastructure is crumbling around itself. computers are so slow and glitchy that you have to apologize to every customer while you both stare at a computer waiting for it to update. Corporate doesn't want to spend money on anything, so our technology is all out of date and the equipment is constantly broken and waiting for repair. $100,000,000,000 in profits last year, and they aren't spending a dime to fix the stores, website, servers, equipment, failed freight system, etc... the list goes on and on. the company is completely focused on cutting costs instead of re-investing in their company. this huge company will fail if they don't get their heads right."
bad,I would always get overworked and barely started and had to close the store by myself. It was very stressful on my body pushing shopping carts all day on hot days. Better to be a cashier or something else. Being a lot associate is the worst job.
bad,Would just go through 300 bays and check a sheet of paper and clean and be done. Change a thousand price tags everyday and build a minimum of twenty projects.
bad,They preach work/life balance but it is always work and no life balance. No communications from management. Say one thing but does another. Very stressful atmosphere.
bad,"There were way too many mandatory training videos that were required to get done on a monthly basis.  They had to be done during working hours, and if there was a rush of customers you were expected to leave the computer station to go help.  The customer FIRST program hinders a lot of progress within the store.  Advancement is very minimal.  Rate of pay is great if you are in high school, or maybe college.  If you are trying to support a family of 4 or higher, then Home Depot is not the place for you.  $9 an hour as a starting pay is not enough to match the average cost of living."
bad,I work 3 shift we are the ones to blame they do. We are the ones that get not food that they give out  they do. We end up in no thanks  no great job no here is a aword  for you   but 1 and 2 shift do.    We have bonus meetings we get the bonus as 1 and 2 shift get the blessings. It hard to work there
bad,It was a decent place to work for.  There isn't much room for advancement unless somebody quits or gets fired.  I was just looking for a job that was close to my house until I found something better and this worked for the time being.
bad,"Their was never enough management working on the floor, very stressful when there was a problem. They like to terminate higher pay employees to reduce overall cost. Made up stories to be able to terminate good employees. Use to be an awesome place to work for in he old days, now just like any box store!!!!"
bad,"Bon centre de formation sur les relations clients et les produits vendus. Cependant, la qualité et l'environnement de travail ne permettent pas une planification d'une carrière qualitative."
bad,Home Depot is best for kids looking for a job during high school. The pay will not support you and instead should be used as drinking money. There is little room for advancement unless you are willing to sacrifice your social life and work awful shifts.
bad,Like filling this out. Blah. Blah. Blah. Hum diddy dum dirty dum. Home depot sucks and I may be bitter but really run for your life as they will set the bridge on fire instead of giving you the chance to burn it yourself.
bad,While The Home Depot was not the worst place to work it had a great many flaws. I lieu of detailing all of them I will get to the most important of them. The Home Depot is primarily focused on those already in management positions not those below them. They focus greatly on their own well being and not so much on the well being of their workers.
bad,I loved the job until corporate insisted on new policies that were not feasible for part employees. Management was initially great but when new management stepped in it became a cut throat atmosphere.
bad,"I do not wish to talk about this job any more then i had to, I did not enjoy my manangement, but i did enjoy the few people that i worked with over the years, They do not care about you. they think your a number to protect their profits."
bad,"I worked in transportation generally the department was nice but had to watch your back. I learned how crucial it was knowing location of trailers in the yard plus if they were secured or not. If management did not like you, you knew it by the way they made you feel not being accepted. The hardest part in transportation was walking in the yard during winter making sure trailers were secure. The best part would be cookouts or if the warehouse did really well they would cater lunch. Best part was being alone working outside in the yard unless it was snowing. I learned a lot about truck companies."
bad,"My job at THD was farmed out to a contract company, that company being VMC. VMC had little to no interaction with their contracted employees. There was nothing above the pay rate that would attack back to working for this company."
bad,"The company has  pursued for leadership and inspired at all levels, but the upper management is struggled on how to motivate and how to operate (execution)."
bad,"When working part time the schedule bounces all over the place, you never know what days off you will have. Very hard to plan outside activities cannot be spontaneous. The best part of this job are our customers. Home Depot has great benefits. Hardest part of this job is not enough coverage and the turn over rate is constant."
bad,Unless you are friends with the management team your chances of being moved or advancing are not going to happen.  And some of the hourly managers get away with stuff that they should not.  And they dont want to get the proper equipment so a person can do their job.
bad,"My largest complaint about Home Depot is their pay. They don't pay the employees enough to live. You start at 10 dollars now and that is only because of the new pay scale they were forced to pay. You can only expect to get about 10 to 20 cents for a pay raise and they think they are done no you a favor."
bad,My time as a MET TEAM ASSOCIATE (MERCHANDISING EXECUTION TEAM) taught me how to work in the lumber department as well as how to build displays for sales promotions and holiday events.
bad,A lot of good people work there but a lot of drama happens.  It isn't always what you know it's who you know. The most qualified are not always the people who get the open positions.  Some people get away with doing anything they please while others are punished for every little thing.  Older individual are pushed out and replaced with younger associates.  The more you are liked by management the better it is for you.  A typical day came to be disappointing because of what you see people getting away with and management praising them.  The culture is great if you can go with the flow.  The hardest part is being used.  The most enjoyable part is make the goals and getting the money rewards.
bad,Working for Home Depot paid my bills and put food on the table and passed time Until I found a better job management at this particular store were and still are a bunch of bullies they will push you to the limit until they find your breaking point and then fire you if you have any quit
bad,"Overall, I enjoyed working there but in the end was extremely dissatisfied. Hardly anyone I worked with is still with the company due to similar issues as I had."
bad,"Depends on location. The store I work for in a bigger city was great, communication between management and employees was fantastic, generally tried to help and understood you were a person and not a number. This store I'm currently at don't communicate with each other let alone employees. Treat you as a number, and none of them understand in-depth esvs."
bad,"Everyone asking how you are doing, and making sure that you had everything you need to do your work. If there is something that you need all you have to do is ask and they will do what they can to help you."
bad,"Don’t get me wrong some managers were cool to work with but they all are about protecting themselves and no one knows what they are doing. One tells you one thing just to have another manager walk up to you to do something different. "
bad,"As a ""specialist"", you are now required to view every breathing customer as a potential ""lead"" for the in-home sales representatives. Having gotten feedback from clients who'd had these people into their homes, the vast majority of the homeowners who have the in-home sales experience end up quite turned off to The Home Depot and feel as if an attempt was made to rip them off with obscenely overpriced goods and services, the only justification for which is that ""Oh, The Home Depot stands behind it"" as if that somehow makes paying double what local providers charge sound reasonable. By their own admission, the in-home sales agents have only a 20% closing rate, which means of course that 80% of the customers do not sign up because they have sense enough to know when a salesperson is ""swinging for the fence"". The in-home process invariably includes a full-price quote followed by multiple discounts pulled out of thin air in an effort to ""close"" the deal. After the so-called ""discounts"", the final price for ""closing today"" is still ridiculous. Refacing is perhaps the best example of this shady practice. A typical refacing of a kitchen is quoted between $13K and $25K when total replacement can be done for less than half that amount. It's not that the sales agents think homeowners are stupid, but just in case they are..."
bad,"Was not that great of a place to work very ""high school"" feel. If you weren't ""cool"" enough or didn't hang out with the right people you were pretty much shamed. Paid my bills for a semester of college but was not a great experience don't even put the job on my resume. And during training then actually tell you not to talk to union reps or you'll be ""let go""."
bad,The hardest part of this job is adapting to the way management treats there employees. There is days where everyone is in a good mood then like a flip on a switch it can turn around.The enjoyable part of this job is the people you can meet.
bad,"Home Depot is a very corporate minded company, who lacks the employee personal skills, that a smaller company possesses. Home Depot offered shares for their employees at a cost, too much money!"
bad,I met great people here but I didn't find a good support from our management. No opportunity to career. Your work is not appreciated! It is a good place for work for teenagers and for retired people. I might return after 65.
bad,Bonito ambiente con los compañeros como estar en casa
bad,"no comments the job was fair it was the co-worker/manager but I say just do you job it will be ok hours  was great. store was clean, displays were set up to understand a sale events"
bad,"Great beginning for young people but be prepared for duplicity and cost saving measures by the company that they masquerade as your fault. This is the night freight shift btw...it's much better during the day, they for the most part appear  bright, happy and receive all sorts of awards but the night shift team? Forget about it...100% turnover annually or worse says it all. Do not see the HD by day and think the night shift is anything like that! You will be ordered, threatened even to so something by your night super or manager that will send the day supervisors into a frothing rage at YOU, because YOU actually did it...like packing up some cabinets in the kitchen/bath area where an empty space is freshly labeled Electrical Overstock Only! The day leaders cannot do jack about the Night Manager, because the Night and Day Managers are directly under the Store Manager. Yet they will  write you up by day for what you are FORCED to do by night. This is a byproduct of no storage area in a warehouse onsite, it all has to be stuffed overhead...every night. Enjoy!"
bad,"The working conditions was all right for a warehouse environment, but the concrete floors was hard to work on. Management was good in some locations and very poor in other location and divisions."
bad,"Friendly employees and management for the most part, but the pay is extremely low and any opportunity to grow with the company will take many years.  Upper level positions with the company appear to be given to those who stick it out for years rather than those that have skills.  The skills you bring to the table will not be considered, only time and performance at Home Depot."
bad,It was an okay job pay was good for the time being but did a lot of work. Things that were not in my job description.  i would recomed this job for a high school student.
bad,"At first it wasnt that bad, however they chose favorites and the only way to advance yourself was to suck up to any management, no matter how hard you worked the only way to be noticed was to chase management around and show them what you did instead of just doing your job.  No matter how well you did you job, if management made you a favorite they would go behind other associates backs to help their favorites, while the hard working employees were left out to dry on a regular basis. "
bad,"a typical night at work includes unloading truck, stoking the merchandise and cleaning up any debris left over."
bad,They undervalue good employees. The pay is poor for what they expect from certain people. Favouritism is unfortunately very common there. However the benefits are good. The one plus to working there I guess.
bad,"Imagine doing your supervisors job for 6 months then them getting promoted. Well that's the Home Depot. I do appreciate them training me on the fork lift and reach truck, and for the first couple months of my job is was great. But after a while they take advantage of you hard and keep adding more things on your plate. Beyond that the computers are so slow and not everyone knows how to use the system.  Some people pretty much get paid to show up while other people carry the store, they have an entire team dedicated to merchandising that don't even merchandise, all they do is set up displays and dust, and they do a pretty bad job at it. Not to mention I have worked a bit later in the lift, and the team in charge of merchandising my dept. at night just sat around and talked for abut an hour straight about non work related stuff. Its a decent job if you don't plan to work there for over a year. But be careful because they don't even give references."
bad,This place was my first job ever they where very serious about there work ethic & timing is everything to them they did work with me understanding that I was the youngest one working for there company
bad,"Management expects a lot, but never offers any help. Pay was minimal and the labor was vigorous. They don't care about your well being, just that you get your tasks done as soon as possible."
bad,"If you are right our of high school, no other bills but maybe a cell phone and car, then this job is right for you. If you have a family, and other responsibilities, this job is not worth the pay. The pay is horrible and if you do get a raise, it is about a .10 cent raise a year. My boss is only making about $1 more and hour than I am. Home Depot has not raised it's pay rate in over 15 years. They fail to pay a living wage for anyone who is out of high school. They will constantly claim they treat their employees like family, and that it not true. It's pretty much propaganda to make you feel needed. Your labor is what they need, the pay is less than adequate."
bad,be self motivated and look out for yourself otherwise you are sure to get burned hear. Allways be on time and don't call in if your going to be late otherwise they will just count u absent
bad,"The freight crew at night was unorganized, we had people running around everywhere and certain departments that should've been done earlier than everyone else but everyone else had to help them when they were done."
bad,"Time clock did not work very often, had to always adjust everyone's hours. Some employees new this and abused it. Time clock got fixed and the next person who messed up clocking in for made and example of and fired(me). A week later they laid off the entire freight team because they were lacking sales during the day. Everyone was told they would have to re apply at other store if they wanted to continue working for Home Depot."
bad,At Home Depot cashiers were expected to provide not only customer service but also thwart suspected shop lifters all the while not leaving their station or register. We were directed to ask customers  how their experience was at Home Depot and to request they fill out the online survey. We were rated on how many positive online surveys we received. I don't ever do online surveys but I do let management know if an employee is especially good or bad. I don't believe their rating system of cashiers was very effective.
bad,"Not much to say other than its an OK place to work if living for yourself and not trying to provide for a family. Working for home depot will definitely teach you new aspects about home improvement, and sharpen you customer service skills."
bad,"Started out promising, but lost its luster.  Really good at talking up opportunity and benefits but unless you are on the favorite list someone who's higher up, opportunities for advancement do not happen often. Full time is very difficult to come by and they say there is a SOP for determining advancement and openings but are rarely followed."
bad,"One of the most stressful jobs i had. There is no communication at all between supervisors at all, and when you help and do your job they threaten to write you up. After a year a so i tried to apply for a different position was declined and said they said i was good where i was."
bad,pay rate is extremely low and they don't offer full time positions to new employees. it is an extremely stressful work environment. also schedule is a problem.
bad,"in the 15 years I worked for company , a steady decline in staffing as well as employee morale ..  More of a (be part of the click) , who you decide to brown nose gets you ahead ..   I left on good terms with tons of high position good references ..  Company is just a shell of what is was as far as actual customer service ,  and employee care ..  Would never return there for employment again"
bad,the job was all about favorites get overtime. favorites have long lunches and breaks. the best associate to get promoted wouldn't even get the job. made all the hardworkers do everything. it wasn't a family oriented environment. coworkers always trying to get the other fired or causing drama. horrible customer service.
bad,Not enough help/coverage to get stuff done in time. Management need to focus more on preserving its workers instead of over working them. Needs to work on treating associates better
bad,Retail hours are tough on private life and mandatory holiday work days make it even tougher. Wages are very low and work is very hard on the body. Very high turnover and inadequate inbound freight system creates a very labor intensive process.
bad,"Long story short, don't date in this workplace. This is where I met my husband, and we both were treated horribly after people found out we were dating. The management was constantly up and down. Some days they were nice, other days they would call you to the office and write you up because ""ringing up your manager"" is a big red flag. I had one manager that cared more about cutting hours and loss prevention over anything. I had one manager that cared more about hanging at the service desk than anything. Anytime I tried to do anything regarding improving my department, no one ever listened or backed me up. Needless to say, my husband and I both had horrible experiences here."
bad,"Stressful work place environment, that is very dirty. Employees all share desks of which are all in highly limited supply, you never know where you will sit the next day. The desks there are dirty and many are infested with insects, and bugs. In addition, the call center has very dirty bathrooms. Moral at the company is low, and people are unhappy there. Over all it isn't a positive or fun place to be in."
bad,"Management is really really bad dont now how to act with you as a person under stuff."
bad,"This job is all talk. The culture, benefits, advancement opportunities, all talk. Management is always hard to find when you need help, and the work/life balance they preach is obviously not important to anyone in management. This job would be a great stepping stone, but I don't see how anyone would be able to not go insane trying to make a career there."
bad,Helping customers with their projects by helping them select items that fit their budget.restocking items on shelves and keeping iles clean.using the lift machine to bring itemes down and putting them away.
bad,Home depot was an ok place to work if you are younger. You can move up in positions. Pay was not conducive of the work requirements. Good resume filler.
bad,"Depending on who your leadership team is makes all the difference in this company.  It is corporate, so it's similar to many other retail jobs out there.  If you have a great store manager and a few great ASMs, you'll love your experience.  But if the management team is lazy, untrustworthy, and unappreciative, it's not a job you'll want for life.  The culture aspect is wonderful, but the execution sometimes falls short."
bad,"While on a whole, people are friendly to each other, the department heads are always changing and it leads to chaos and confusion. They don't always have the right person in the right position."
bad,"No communication between managers, very slow on equipment training. They will not hire people for jobs that are needing to be filled when asked day after day."
bad,good benefits crazy hours most people believe in teamwork management not so much it is very corporate focus customer service is focus if it fits in management style
bad,the home depot was a nice place to work at for college kids who lived with their and had no personal bills to pay or retired people who just needed healthcare coverage
bad,"A typical day was very fast. Assisted customer with products, store location, order placing and tacking. I learned more about everyday tools that I use and would like to use. Management wasn't the best and the culture was subpar. The hardest part of the job was telling a customer that their shipment was delayed do to the carrier and they were anticipating the order. I enjoyed the happiness of a customer when I was able to locate an item that they needed and could not find it."
bad,"I worked in order fulfillment. a job where I was in charge of picking, staging, palatalizing, loading and unloading flatbed and box trucks with the three types a machinery I was trained on (forklift,reach,OP). knowing the system in and out. picking everything within a timely manner and with pinpoint accuracy. I would also find and stage online special orders that the customers would buy online and update the system. I would contact customers about problems and get things resolved as quickly as possible in order to finish they're order and move on to the next. I was payed $10.00 an hour to do this. but yet again I was payed the same amount as a guy who grabs carts in the parking lot."
bad,"Alright for a starting position but the pay when i worked there wasn't so great. Management does not care about medical problems or personal well-being. The Front End staff is nice but the rest of the managers you barely see or know. It is very hard to move up in the company especially starting as a cashier and most of the time management only promotes those that they are close with. It takes them hours to get to you if you need help with a customer problem and sometimes they just don't even come. There are no discounts or perks to working there. As I said before, decent for a High School graduate as a starting job but not as a long-term career."
bad,This company taught me a lot about business aspect of the retail business. My co workers were like family. Unfortunately they work you to death and give 10 cent raises per year. It would take 10 years to make a dollar more.
bad,I would not recommend the Home Depot.  The company has changed significantly for the worse.  Not at all satisfied with the management team - very cut-throat.
bad,A lot of work for very little pay. No discount. Senority rules over everything. If you get hurt you are automatically placed on a final or even fired.
bad,"A typical day at work involves working all over the store while being held accountable for your specific department, although you may only spend 4 hours in it, as a full-time associate, in most days. The requirements are steep for the lack of help allowed to be scheduled. Stress is pretty high for the Wal-Mart of home improvement which in turn creates chaos and turmoil. Customers are left to fend for themselves and become irritated, because help is not available, which increases stress of the employee. Management is pretty useless, which I think is why there is a constant turnover of managers. The higher you move the more unstable the position becomes. There is no real gain to becoming a supervisor or manager, especially for the pay increase. I pumped septic for a higher income than an assistant manager at Home Depot, but a knee failure caused me to use home depot as a stepping stone, 11 year stepping stone. The thing that keeps me going back other than I haven't found anything new, Is that it makes me feel good to help people and the feeling of accomplishment I get most days when I punch out and reflect on the crazy day I am leaving behind. This would be a great part-time place to work for, but it is not a career, it is only a job, use it for extra income and the good feeling you get after the day is over."
bad,Don't expect job advancement unless you have worked there for over 10 years. Managers pick favorites and give grunt work to others. Pays well. But that's it.
bad,"Always disorganized with schedules and short staffed. Expects a lot for very little pay. Communication in the store is awful, different managers would tell you different things."
bad,very drama filled enviroment. managers cared very little about customer and associate time. store manager was barely around and often acted as a dictator.
bad,"I really loved all of my coworkers, however the environment of the store is always very stressful."
bad,"customer service all day.  as Seasonal Success Captain I ensured the first aid kits were well stocked. I ensured spill kits were stocked and secured.  I checked fire hydrants, alarms, general safety issues.  I was also in charge of ensuring that all employees completed the monthly safety training as required.  I was also responsible for clean up and disposal or mark down of busted bags of soil, concrete, fertilizer ect."
bad,"Sometimes we would go in and there would be stuff everywhere that we needed to get done. Other nights there wouldn't be a single thing too do, so it sorta just depended on the truck arrival."
bad,There was a lack of management but job culture was good i liked working with others but the managers proved to be difficult to work with in the process.
bad,"Really loved working for the company when first hired, but never given any opportunity to advance despite being valuable and well liked in the company."
bad,"great opportunity , excellent people, a lot to do and hard schedule from 5 am  to 2pm , I use to make daily balances, purchases for all the store, scheduling and payrool with quickbooks. prepare all documentations for audits"
bad,For the most part Home Depot was a decent place to work for. The only thing is I tried to get Family Medical Leave and was turned down because I didn't have enough hours. That was their police and I understood that at the time.
bad,"I worked at the home depot for a good 3 months, and sometimes the managers wouldn't be doing their job with helping new workers. Also I would be put into work on a job that I didn't have experience in without help."
bad,Busy place work at keeps you busy all day and makes your day go by fast. But didn't really enjoy working there because i was only part time and you didnt really get helped when you needed. Management was ok we had meetings meetings about safety and got free meals.
bad,"start at 5 am ends at 1:30 pm "
bad,"It's a good place for a beginner job developing a career should not be the goal here."
bad,"Very difficult place to work, 5 sales managers in one year. They take away your commission if there is any problems with the sale. Promises not kept. Not in charge of your calendar. Sold the job as an independent rep when you are truly an employee. They do not reimburse your travel or needs."
bad,"At the store I work at anyway.  Management is out of touch, and truly doesn't care, despite the show they put on for others.  Expect more out of employees and don't pay very well.   Hire and retain lazy workers then promote those lazy workers while the truly good workers have to do even more."
bad,"It is a very toxic work environment, a lot of time wasted, and management is incapable of doing their jobs.  Managers seem to come to hang out rather than work."
bad,"It takes a long - long - long time to move up in the company.  Don't apply there if you want to move up the corporate ladder.  Before you can advance and get a raise, you have to get all the kids in your WHOLE state to clap at the same time."
bad,A lot of interaction with customers. Product testing and and training on how to use different products. Set up fully functional seasonal displays. Inventory control with counts and ordering.
bad,They were very motivated by the overall agenda of the company's decision makers. At first glance the management team  was very professional and wanted to support it associates goals which was seemingly evident by their Homer Fund.The associates are diverse loyal and motivated. After working there for a year I will say that almost the whole management team has been replaced by new management. It is my opinion that the way of operations have changed. Management is not concerned with it's associates. There objective is too push employees past the point of exhaustion while simultaneously breaking their spirits and self confidence. They use scare tactics resulting in employees and supervisors having the same attitude as previously mentioned at the beginning but under different circumstances. employees are still Loyal but motivated by the threat of being unemployed. You'll find few there who are happy or better still who would stay if they had other options.
bad,Management at my store was 50/50. Half of the managers were wonderful while the other half made your life living nightmare! There is no work/life balance at all! They own you!
bad,Management harasses employees about metrics that are near impossible to meet due to system issues they refuse to fix. I've worked at other call centers but I've never seen a company so worried about numbers but so unwilling to fix the system issues that contribute to these issues.
bad,"Fast paced work environment, packing down, assisting customers, and keeping shelves organized. Customers are always first priority."
bad,Not a positive retail experience as either an employee or customer. will not go back to work for them. what else is thur to know?
bad,"company wise its great. store wise management sucks. hard to even advance in the company without giving something up. Assistant managers treat you like your a expendable part of the company, they say we can find someone to do the job better."
bad,"There is an ""us and them"" atmosphere. If you don't hang out after work with the other staff you are ""banished"" The management team was bad at communication and morale was terrible."
bad,"First things first, I really enjoyed working with all the people at Home Depot, my counterparts, local management and the store associates, the problem was the the sale system (if you can call it a system). They instent the store employees to set up appointments for the outside reps, however they set no expectations with the customer, there only goal is to set an appointment. They would not allow the outsides sale rep to contact the customer before the appointment, this caused a great number of no-shows. I understand no-shows however Home Depot doesn't pay any milage, so it is costing you money to go on no-shows. the other issue is that there is no price conditioning going on, customer has no ballpark idea on cost. I had showed up to a customer's home and they expected to speed less then a thousand dollars and we were quoting a job in the several thousand, this caused the customer to have sticker shock."
bad,"Management does not promote within, not really a company you can grow with, does not care about family structure, management doesnt have a clue to the daily operation of the store."
bad,"When you speak to a manager at this store you would get better results talking to a fencepost. Job security is great, but if your good at your job, you will go no where, however if you brown nose and suck at your job you are assured a promotion within 3 months"
bad,hourly wages were poor  raises were even worse  liked the ppl and helping customers very much though. seemed like we did the work and managers reaped the benifits
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees, call center environment, metrics based, not challenging.  Very structured environment, too much socializing with management, not consistent."
bad,"Pretty easy customer service job if you know what you're talking about otherwise you're boned cause the training is completely insufficient, the value put on being part of a team is excellent and actually up-holded in there, other low level employees are all nice and tend to want to help you, management on the other hand looks for any screw ups so they can boot you out the door cause the less employees they have on at the end of the ""Season"" the more money management gets as a result. There were people in there that they wanted gone so they suspended them for being a minute late 3 times in a week, which according to policy they can do but you also have to clock in with everybody else at that exact time so it's kinda hard core if they want you gone they will find so many reasons you literally can't do anything."
bad,"I was in a field where there were no opportunities to grow as an employee. Low pay, weird hours, low moral. I loved my position, but I was working for a company that I would never amount to anything in. I go to school for healthcare, and I was working in home improvement retail."
bad,"A typical day at work included routine warehouse procedures ie. spotting for forklift drivers, beam & grate movement, bailing cardboard, & compacting trash. I was also the first associate in the company's photo audit start-up project. I was auditing photos for 148 stores in the Midsouth,"
bad,providing excellent customer service. I learned many different aspects of the company. Most of my co workers are in the same position that I am. The hardest part is not having a set schedule. Meeting different people and getting to help customers is enjoyable.
bad,es una compañía bajo mucha exigencia pero con la posibilidad de aprender mucho sobre obras civiles dentro de pemex
bad,The store manager was very in gaged with the performance of his store and his employees. However there were too many chiefs that didn't communicate with the other chiefs. A lot of doing and redoing. Tasks were unorganized at best.
bad,"The main role as an associate is to take care of the customers. In between customers you down stock, face shelving, put away returns, and assist your fellow employee. I have learned how to use many computer programs, smart phone programs, and much product knowledge. With it being a large retail chain, you work with many different people. Some can be great, others not so much. But when you have been there as long as I have you know the not so great ones don't last long, usually due to attendance issues. But, at the same time, the great ones don't last long either. They move on to better jobs. Then you have the lifers, who have been there 8+ years, and couldn't make more than what they are at now, so they stay. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the politics, and the hypocrisy. Management has gone down hill as of lately, and trying to push through the day to day garbage gets harder and harder. The best part of my job is helping people. I don't always have the answer to your problem, but I'll go out of my way to try and find you the right answer."
bad,there is a lot of work to be done in little time. worked load gets tossed around from person to person.
bad,"This is a standard retail job. You can learn a lot about maintaining a home if you get put in the right position. However if you have a close friends and family, are looking to pay the bills without stress of a fluctuating paycheck, or looking for some structure in your life, this isn't the job for you unless you plan to get into management."
bad,A typical day is inclusive of interaction with customers and catering to their product needs. I have learnt that retail has limited growth opportunities. Some of my co-workers are great while others are not happy with working at the Home Depot. There is a high turnover at the retail level for several reasons which are inclusive of management overlooking the potential of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job comes from the satisfaction of assisting customers to make the best purchase decision for their budget without compromising functionality and efficiency.
bad,"management is not professional enough, there is a schedule problem every time. associate does not work hard enough and supervisor does not care about it"
bad,My job was to make sure we take care of the customers needs. Show the core values of the company and help assist customers. I was responsible for setting up appointments.
bad,Employee's do no respect one another. Management Did not appreciate the associates. Supervisors and managers looked at associates as workers and nothing more. Employee opinions and suggestions were never taken serious or followed up on. Associate training videos are inconsistent with actual work on the sales floor. Always a lack of department coverage. Employee egos got in the way of getting the job done. overall the home depot is a very unhealthy place to work.
bad,not a great work life balance. very unfair treatment of employees. management talk to employees poorly and theres no one to report them to. they treat you like animals and expect you to continuously work under mentally stressful conditions caused by management.
bad,being able to move stores and the bonuses are decent. the people are great. like a big family. but the life work balance is difficult especially around holidays and events.
bad,"Always under staffed and communication is awful between associates and management. Great place to meet new people, but all and all I would not recommend it."
bad,"Bad hours, you learn on your own for the most part, bad management, great coworkers, hardest part of the job is training yourself. Nothing enjoyable about it."
bad,"Management was very poor! They very clearly pick favorites and take advantage of good workers. The work is very tough for the pay depending on which department you are in. They should consider paying more for the really difficult jobs apposed to the cushy jobs. Its really unfair. Also the supervisors just seem to stand around and chat, also they seem to talk badly about their staff which in turn starts drama in the work place. All observations and very unprofessional for management!"
bad,"Overworked, Understaffed, Underpaid, No benefits cause ALL hired on as SEASONAL ONLY so they let u go and the Full timers/Mngmt Keep the Bounses for themselves"
bad,For the amount of work that you do in the warehouse you are not compensated nearly enough. The supervisors will love you as long as you are making them look good but will not recommend you for anything although you are a dedicated hard worker.
bad,"A typical week involved 75-90 hours with managerial expectations that were more often than not, unachievable within the timelines given to complete tasks by a less than full staff.  THD is saving money by cutting the hours of hourly associates with the expectations still intact. They have an excellent public face but the Assistant Store Managers are the ones that are run into the ground by higher manager.  The hourly associates are protected by Human Resources and have numerous vehicles to voice their concerns; however, middle management is left to the wolves. I also learned this is a company with a long history of removing older managers and replacing them with 25-30 year olds. The company CEO retired and the new one is changing the direction of the company to ensure money first, employees second."
bad,"The customers were not bad, despite the location. It was the employees, they are childish, gossip a lot and  worry about everybody's personal business in the store instead of doing their job. It could be because they are older and miserable and they've been there so long maybe they've learned to deal with it but I could never. Everyday on the front end you basically do the same thing come in ring up customers, help them find things, straighten up the front end etc. The head cashiers are lazy, you can never find them when you need help. They are supposed to put the customers first, they don't care they're still going to get paid. I learned to fully research every company before I accept a position and to never work at another home depot again. The cashiers start off with around $9, it's not minimum wage but with them constantly cutting hours and barely giving you any to begin with you mind as well make minimum wage. Their competitor Lowe's cashiers start off with around $11 it's not all about the salary but they make soooo much money as a company and their employees are underpaid. When I began working for the company they gave me the whole there's room for growth shabang which is a lie. You have to fight to get your quarter raise that your more than obligated to after six months and if you switch to another department you'll be lucky to get fifty cents more no matter what the starting rate should be and they also hate for you to ask for full time work. They claim there are no extra hours but the employees that are already full time and have been there for a while are constantly"
bad,"I learned how to deal with many types of people and their personalities..every day was different when it came to customers but it was very rewarding...Most of my co-workers were pleasant to work with and some..well ..you cant make everyone happy..."
bad,My time at the Home Depot has been a frustrating struggle against the narrow mindedness intrinsic in mammoth bureaucracies. My need to grow and prove myself as a valuable member of the company that employs me is stifled at every opportunity due to the rigid culture of strict adherence to corporate dictum.
bad,"All while I was at home depot, I felt I was being abused by management and not only that management sucks at their job. They are hardly around and when they are around they are constantly writing you up instead of praising you for doing a good job. I left the company because they were mistreating the customers and employees. The list about this place goes on and on!"
bad,"Working for Home Depot is an interesting experience that has taught me you have to look out for yourself. Outside of helping customers which is usually the fun part of the job tasking is usually one person telling another person to do something and this cycle repeating 2 or 3 times until nothing gets done. Usually at this point the closest lowest ranking person be told to finish the job with full accountability. "
bad,It was an okay place to work. The politics were not so good. Management wasn't very supportive. Most of my colleagues were a lot of fun to work with. Management would move people from one department to another and not give them the time needed to do the training for the new position. There were times that I was the only one at the service desk and would call for backup over and over and no one would come. Very stressful.
bad,"I like working fast pace jobs like this and have a great Assistant Store Manager but, I dont like how the Store Managaer runs the store. He doesn't care about the employees how every boss should care about the fact everyone has family, kids, bills, and a life outside the job. It takes something drastic like a really bad review from the employee store survey to just get his attention."
bad,Ability to train and coach others and work with several different levels of management but it was extremely difficult to be considered for promotions.  Little to no backing from upper management in personal development.
bad,It is exactly what you would expect from a retail job. Not a lot of perks but if you are willing to work and accomplish your goals then you should have no problem getting promoted
bad,"Responsible for processing truck shipments , while maintaining that store product shelf are full and neatly presented. operate order-picker and forklift to move pallets of product. fill-out and process refill orders."
bad,"Place runs like a conveyor belt when it comes to sales associatees, always looking to replace people for cheaper pay, my whole department was let go and replaced with people who didn't make as much as we did. Managment were looking for any excuse to let us go if not the whole department then one by one by firing us."
bad,"i loved this job it was the best job ever, we would have store meeting and prices and bonuses every 3 months for doing a great job on sales which i really liked, also this company loved there employees and treated us like a equal community. management was awesome"
bad,I worked in the phone center at first so I was answering incoming calls and forwarding the callers to the correct departments. At one point I was a cashier so I assisted customer in ringing up the product they wanted to purchase. Learning a lot of the product and what it was used for is quite challenging. I enjoyed working with the public.
bad,"no work life balance , work 55-60 hours a week in management opening is very early and closing is very late. If you have no life it is a good stable job, if you get a good store manager they will work the same hours you do, The store manager might play favorites."
bad,dull work environment lacks excitement management lacks experience pay is ok bad location suspect customers good product and service options
bad,"A typical day in the paint department when opening, consisted of showing up at 5 A.M. to prepare for the soon coming onslaught of contractors at 6:30 A.M. Duties included filling of all tint cylinders used for mixing paint. Make necessary signs for product displays. Down stocking low quantity items on shelves. Lots of lifting of 5 gallon paint buckets, pump sprayers, etc. Paperwork and reports filled out.  When doors opened at 6:30, the backup helper would come in to help fulfill the orders of probably 10 - 15 + contractors, all waiting to be served and get out into the field. Running and jogging was the constant work pace to take care of business. The list of responsibilities also included picking up returned items and placing back in their correct place, constantly keeping the walkways free of debris and taking it all back to the compactor to discard. Constant customer service, i.e, answering questions, tinting and mixing stock and custom order paint, retrieving spray paint from locked cages, equipment rentals, notating low quantity items for ordering, answering constant phone calls, much more. Also assisted in other departments when needed. Top quality customer service was first in importance. I received many awards for such."
bad,"Decent job for the work, but you are underpaid, not given reviews or raises on time, and are made false promises to string you along by management."
bad,The job was ok in the beginning until new management.The job tasks that where being done where unsafe.The manager did not care about any of the employees safety.
bad,"Management leads its associates on forever telling them they'll get more hours, a raise, more training, but it never happens. When they do want you to train they make you train while your on the sales floor but if you miss one customer they poo all over you."
bad,"I do not recommend Home Depot for a family oriented employee, because being full time you need to be completely flexible."
bad,"It was a great job to start, the people are very fun to work with. There is profit sharing. The sick time and vacation time are really good. Not a job to make a career out of unless you want  to move up through the company."
bad,"I worked as a part-time employee working the night shift."
bad,Hardest part of the job was lifting those heavy objects and trying not to hurt others or yourself. Most associates are nice some are not.
bad,I was full time and always avaiable but now I have 3 kids so I'm only able to work part time nights.I had loved being a head cashier and working with others it was a fun learing experince.the hardest part of the job was always being on your feet but I always got threw it.I really enjoyed working with others and getting to no the customers from a day to day basies.
bad,Stress full work place management only cares about sales. You cant get help from co-workers when you need them.
bad,"You shop (shopped) there I'm sure, working there is just like the customer service. Use your Imagination."
bad,Hard to truly balance life with constant turn over and change within company.
bad,"I was a Home Depot associate @ store 118 in Decatur,Ga for two years and each year I hoped for things to get better but they actually became worst."
bad,"Cool people, hard work. Hardest job I ever had for little money"
bad,it not really good with pay they had a hard time moving me up when i ask and tried a lot of times. the benefits are good and some of the people that i had work with were nice but management could be be better.
bad,"The schedules are designed to assure maximum friction in your family and social life. 20% of the employees are badgered into completing the work while the 80% take it easy, resulting in serious long term health consequences for those abused. You are paid fewer holidays than most and your medical bills will largely result from how management does not properly staff or plan workloads."
bad,"After 5-1/2 years and MILLIONS of dollars in sales and revenue generated, Home Depot's loyalty to employees is almost non existant, even when one they're threatened or assaulted by customers.  The customer is almost ALWAYS in the right no matter how much physical, verbal or personal abuse they direct to the HD associate."
bad,"The company is highly competitive not with other retail stores but within the company stores it selves.  Average politics.  Benefits are only for full-timers.  Part-timers are cut off medical benefits."
bad,"Good benefits, poor management. Physically demanding job. Had some helpful co-workers. Set schedule. Alright pay scale."
bad,"Average retail job with a twist."
bad,You meet some great people but a lot of idiots too!Very hard work for poor compensation.
bad,"Receive payment transactions and guiding and solving queries of customer. "
bad,You have to be a huge butt kisser in order to get anywhere in this company.
bad,"Sort of throw you into the fire without much help."
bad,"Helping other with a smile on my face"
bad,"If one likes unimaginative repetitive work, then HD is the fit. Don't want to work and kiss management butt to move up, then HD is the fit. I can't say anything positive."
bad,"I operated fork lifts, unloaded trucks, provided customer support, and restocked shelves overnight."
bad,As a part timer you hours will be reduced. It's so bad that I'm only working 12-14 hours a week.
bad,"Work all day and night . Do one thing wrong and off you go. Your required to set plans , customer service , and physical work but not compensated for it."
bad,the busiest time of my day is only a couple hours long since I'm in the the back corner and don't get very many people but i do get a lot of phone calls and i help the incoming calls go to the direct department so they can figure out what they need. Most of my co workers are very rude and that also includes the asm and department heads everyone plays favorites and its really hard to even get an interview inside the company because of this. but some of them I became close to. I think the most hardest is that when a customer is really mad and currently hates every body and nobody is to be found and I get yelled at for not knowing what the customer is needing. so write it down and when I can i find the product and ask question about just in case if a customer ask me. helping customer and knowing you made a impact on one of them because you teach them something that they may not know.
bad,it was an good company... once they cared about there employees made sure they had the necessary tools they needed to do there job (ie. training in what merchandise the have in the entire store) use to pay accordingly now its how much management feels they want to give you.. raises use to be generous now if you are a rank 4 employee they give u $.35 raise for the year...
bad,Working with people in there homes is fun and rewarding to me. I work independent of all others. The management is a lot of help.
bad,Always expected to be on call and available anytime. Employee personal time is completely disregarded. The job roles on paper are well defined but after employment you are expected to be able to anything and everything at the whim of management. Lack of processes and change management in IT.
bad,"A typical day at work was rushing from meeting to meeting with little to no time between to address any outstanding items from the prior meeting. Long days due to too many items to address with no time available in the work day to complete. I liked working there in spite of this."
bad,"My day starts with greeting customers that come into our store, directing them to the aisles where they need to find the products that they are seeking. I have learned to deal with many types of customers and how to deal with money, as I am also a back up cashier. My coworkers and manager are great, from the day I stared, they have been there to make me feel like part of the team. I don't find my job to be hard and I feel confident when helping customers with their needs."
bad,"Customer service is my favorite part of the job. I watered plants daily , stocked daily, and dealing with other co-workers who like to slack off made for a hard day."
bad,"love transporting clients, but the management wasn't firm for the employees, that's a big reason for getting laid off ."
bad,"hot and sunny "
bad,I enjoyed working here until I reported being sexually harassed by a fellow team member.  Nothing was done about it except moving him to another department but he was still able to come into my area and say or suggest inappropriate things.  I put in my two week notice once I realized that no matter how many times I reported it nothing was gThis particular location did nothing to prevent further sexual hrassmentoing to change.
bad,"I have been with the company for 5 long years, and its time for a change i am no longer happy at my job. They dont care about their employess at all. This is not a job i would reccomend for anyone"
bad,"the work versus pay is terrible. im thankful i have the job to help with bills but the management is awful, they're very demeaning and your only noticed when you do something wrong."
bad,"Merchandised products according to profit potential."
bad,a typical day at work consist of helping customers find the right items and making sure they have a good experience. 
bad,"As a female I had many customers and some supervisors hitting on me often. I'm not exactly looking for that in a work place. Some customers would whistle at you from across the store for assistance instead of approaching you like a human. Many customers would speak to me rudely or become very angry when they wouldn't have things their way. I had two supervisors ask me to go home with them. Home Depot put me out on the sales floor with very little training and other employees where of little help- some were threatened by having a new employee doing the same job as them... some had fewer responsibilities than I did so they just couldn't help me... or lets face it.... Home Depot is always UNDERSTAFFED. I could go on, but I'll spare you. "
bad,"Tear down and rebuild displays. Traveling from store to store to"
bad,The operation at THD RDC 5851 was pleasurable until the amount of new hires and the managements push for higher volumes too much to handle safely on a daily basis. before i resigned i was hit by a new hires forklift because there was too much congestion. the company made the descision of requiring work on saturdays for most employees which was not a part of the policy that was in place when i started working there
bad,"Management at my store was HORRIBLE.  They never listen to employee's, customers, or even other regional employee's."
bad,Made to work outdoors in freezing temperatures for 8 hours. Always had to work 11am to 8pm and had to take an hour lunch. Didn't have time to do anything else.
bad,low pay but flexable hours good medical plan overall good for students and semi-retired people
bad,"a typical day at work consists of stocking, loading, and customer service. I learned a lot in different departments, co workers are great, management has its moments every now and then. the hardest part of the job is when you get your hours cut, most enjoyable part is just working overall."
bad,"A typical day at work would include lack of communication by all forms of management and the lack to do their jobs correctly. My co-workers were great, but again the management, or lack their of, was horrible. I have worked in 2 home depot's and the management was lackluster in both stores."
bad,Enjoyed working in a diverse environment. Co-workers were helpful and fun. I learned how to deal with complaints and problem solve.
bad,Night at Home Depot went fast not busy at all. At this job I learned that theres always going to be somebody that dosent want to see you advance in whatever it is u do. Managers didnt pay attention to my work ethic and drive to do great at my position. As far as my employees they seemd to be a sneaky always talking behind my back as if I didnt work hard. The hard thing about my position was lefting heavy equipment without having the proper machine. I enjoyed the times we got meals on break.
bad,"For the most part I enjoyed my job because the co-workers are great and the customers are as well, the bad part is they use you and promise you advancements that never come. They give you advancements, not based on performance or dependability, but on how ""buddy-buddy"" you are with the supervisors and managers. The Human Resources lady is lazy and careless especially about the schedule. Two of the assistant managers are creepy to the point of in-appropriate harassment. After a year of work they finally decided to give me a promotion because I had given my two weeks, when they had given another a promotion after only 4 months of working there because they were ""buddy buddy"" with her."
bad,"Scheduling was only decent if you were part-time, otherwise you had to work whenever and where ever they wanted you. Difficult dealing with several managers who don't usually agree on tasks to be done."
bad,"That about sums it up...they give you little to no benefits. What they do offer, you can't afford."
bad,Since it is a customer service industry the number one task is to seek customers and make sure all of their needs are being met. There isn't a lot of direction during down time and sometimes not a lot gets done.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with internal pressure. Pay is low in this area, but performance expectations are high. Management is negative, and employee moral is low. Customers are great!"
bad,The Home Depot allowed me to find a niche that I never would have known.
bad,"Schedule is never the same, could need to be at work anytime from 5am to midnight, difficult to request a day off, if you have problems with your schedule it's blamed on ""the computer system"", Management uses threats of write ups and firing to motivate employees, communication from mngt to associates is spotty at best, Managers do not communicate with one another, priorities change constantly."
bad,Management is more concerned about their bonuses and big numbers than if the job is done correctly.
bad,stable job but no annual raise . plus no advancement from within
bad,"I let due to management being inconsistent and biased. Most of my co-workers were amazing and were very supportive, the management on the other hand was not. We consistently changed ASMs and DHs and there was no clear direction. There was obvious favoritism and the ASMs would always have conflicting orders on how things should be run and what should be done at any given time."
bad,Good place to work if you want a fast pace and a demanding environment. Offer some recognition of employees but for the most part want you to work without recognition. Great benefits. Not very good pay. May be in multiple departments depending on staffing.
bad,"Co-worker on the team are great but unfortunately management and most of the other departments gave us the short end of the stick. When the team is short of people (more often than it should) we usually have to go overtime or work without break to get the truck done. The truck are also poorly packed, making it harder to unload than it should."
bad,Loved the job and benefits were great but employees were rude and uncaring. Would not work here again. Had to fight for myself consistently through out work
bad,"Enjoyed my job as a cashier and di my job very well, however, management and supervisors make promises about promotions and growth they never fulfill. There are many younger employees in the front end who enjoy being petty towards other female employees. It's a lot of gossiping and management is very back and forth."
bad,"They are very flexible with hours and the pay isn’t that bad, but some managers may talk to you as if you were stupid. You also have to kiss up in order to move up with the company, or even get your way around the store. Also some DHs can be rude and not helpful at all. Sometimes you can even find a good associate to help you complete a task."
bad,I didn't work there very long. Home Depot it self is a great company. The job was a job. It wasn't a company that supported it's employees. Not on my shift anyway.
bad,I look young for my age and am also a woman and I have felt like I have been treated unfairly because of it. I beg to be scheduled in deliveries to get more hours (where my male coworkers are scheduled.) The HR manager feels like one of the most unsafe people to talk to. The store manager tried to fire me because of what someone went to him and said about me. He didn't investigate it. I proved them wrong and still work there
bad,"Management is a questionable circus. It breaks down to manager & ASM goals, in America stores that changes yearly as people are transferred. Sometimes listening to Managers can cost you dearly"
bad,"The training could be better. And the head cashiers are not supported to new employees. Also breaks are not given per California State law, or lunch. They pretty much throw you out there. If you have a question or make a mistake the head cashiers will be rude and make you feel stupid in front of the customers."
bad,"In this particular store, management DO NOT care how hard you work, if your name doesn't come up on a survey, you literally don't exist. In order to move the ladder, you have to be the manager's pet. We're constantly understaffed and managers do nothing about it. They are so concern about making the customers happy and satisfied but don't bother to do the same for the employees. There's barely any recognition for your work and the rewards suck. Seriously, a plastic cup as a reward just for getting leads and certificates just for meeting sales goals for those who work on Specialty (ex. Appliances). The pay is minimum wage, so don't expect to get good raises and you don't get pay by commissions nor by exceeding sales goals, and neither by the years you spend working with the company. "
bad,You can learn as many other positions in the store and it doesn’t help in the long run. Management only care about their selves. Working full time so to stressful when no one really has your back.
bad,"Good for part-time, don't pick overnight, they will squeeze your soul for their own benefit"
bad,"The Home Depot is a great retail store to work at and gain knowledge about different areas for real life although they do not provide equivalent pay or hours for the cost of living and are not willing to give hours needed. Management is great and environment is very inviting, schedules and picking up shifts is such a hassle and hours are always lowered, it’s not a good place to work if you actually need the money."
bad,The job has taught me to operate a forklift and helped me grow as a person. It's taught me how to engage better with people and to help be a leader in the toughest time tool rental went through.
bad,"Being a Cashier at Home Depot was... An experience. I've often found myself being the only cashier on the floor and having to swiftly check out several customers without aid."
bad,I worked here for almost a year. When I got hired my manager told me she would happily work with my college schedule and limit my time to just weekends when school started. I did that for a few months and she suddenly called me and said I needed to work weekdays. There were 2 associates working only weekends and she did not tell them that they had to work weekdays now. I told her I could not do that and she said if I didn’t start working weekdays she’d have me go on leave until summer. This place was a very stressful environment and they have such a high turnover rate because it sucks to work there.
bad,Home Depot is pretty relaxed for the most part but the management likes to micro manage and the store does rise you up she always found ways to put down the associates
bad,Low hours and pay is low as well. Management was fine. We had cookouts and celebrated holidays. You can win prizes and it was a nice environment. Pay checks just wasn't enough
bad,I been working here for 3 years. Coworker work well with each others but at the new hiring we really needed. They either get fired or let go due to hours for the veterans workers...which is not the best idea to put so much stressed on them.
bad,I worked lot so basically my responsibility was to be outside for more or less the entire shift regardless of weather. that be in the lot or in the mulch pit in the summer
bad,"The company is great "
bad,"Goods and bads of working there, District team inconsistent with their decisions and store manager did not do his job with integrity. There are a lot of good people there but have to watch for those who want to get rid of you."
bad,They did not have a lot of respect for the customers when I worked there. Management was not the greatest fit because they never did handle the the fact that customers had to wait over a half hour just to get their lumber cut. Also it took way to much to find someone to help a customer with something so simple like finding the right person to help them pick out the right lightbulb.
bad,Get ready to drink the Orange Koolaid! The company in a whole is a decent but management is awful and they push you to pick get your numbers up but if you are slow your not going to be any favorite..and get ready for weekly VTO and constantly lifting heavy items.
bad,"I’m going to get straight to the point as of right now the hourly wage is 11.00 per hour. You are hired by vendors to merchandise, maintenance  and fully stock their merchandise. The raises are not that good you only get 25 cents a year the But this job all of your work is timed by the minute for example your doing bay service to maintain and fully  stock a bay that sales maybe 1 million dollars a year and you only get up to 20 minutes to complete this bay. I only get 19 cents per minute so if I’m doing something where the store could make up to 1,000 dollars for an 1 hour of my time I’m only getting 11. Dollars for to service it"
bad,"Decent job, decent people, it’s a retail job so expect what you will from other retailers, it’s fast paced especially in the lumber registers, nice break rooms, not so great management at times, lack of voices being heard by management, bad scheduling"
bad,I had fun working there but when they told me I couldnt go pick up my child from the babysitter one day i was done. I wasnt perfect either. They did give employes at least one break mostly 2 each shift
bad,"The MET team is a pretty simple job. Not very hard, just stock shelves, make sure everything is clean. Co workers, are decent, sometimes even fun people. Management at the Home Depot isn't great, they do the bare minimum and that's about it."
bad,"Every day we see many customers coming into the store for simple returns to returns on special orders, almost every customer comes in clueless about the process of returns. Customers also come to the service desk to pick up online and special orders such as special order cases of tile to refrigerators and ranges. The service desk is the main section that all customers come to when they have any question, but they cannot find a department associate in the aisles. The management is more concerned with their own goals, rather than be the backbone to the operation of the store. Managers rather hideaway to the back office to worry about store walks with the district manager rather than help fellow associates with complex special orders or assist the checkout line. The hardest part of the job is understanding the store software such as the special services screens or ESVS and be able to use it at its full capacity to help customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is, in the end, having a satisfied customer that their problem has been solved and will acknowledge your hard effort to upper management or complete the online survey."
bad,It was a very demanding job. You are expected to do the job of people who don't pick up the slack and then it's made to look like your fault. Constant changing management with about a 50/50 percent of then being good at their jobs.
bad,"Customer service included driving machinery helping customers load goods onto their transportation. Certified for forklift, reach, pacer, and order picker"
bad,Normal retail experience with slightly better than average pay. Ok work environment and a good team mentality but hard to balance personal life with varied schedule.
bad,"Be careful. They didn’t tell me my job was temporary! At the end of the third month I asked why I wasn’t scheduled for the following week. They said it was because it was a temporary position. When I said I didn’t know that the manager said what do you want me to tell you?.  I called HR. I want to HR to know that I really liked my job, I was doing a good job, and I was surprised to learn that my job is temporary.HR said speak to the local management that they were probably jobs available.   I asked the manager if my contract could be extended. The manager said he would look into it but he did not get back to me and did not return my phone calls. Since there were too many cashiers on, I didn’t even work my last day. No work, no pay!"
bad,Had some nice people but the management was not the best they always had attitudes or were gloomy. Worked for the company for almost two years until i moved to new jersey and the home depot was just not run the same or correctly as far as management and who were head of the department.
bad,"The pay is decent but it’s not an enjoyable job. You pretty much have 2 jobs at once, a warehouse worker and a salesman. I also feel like it depends on which store you work at how good or bad an experience you’ll have with co-workers and management but I’ve been belittled a handful of times now."
bad,"I’ve tried for years to get on at Home Depot. Once I got it, I was set. After about a month my part-timer quit. I was left to my own devices. Inevitably, management started coming down on me, fairly hard. I stuck to my routine, and did what they asked, as the added objectives. Everyday was something new, nobody liked this, or I missed this task. If I actually did I’d take my fault. I’m an honest person. Constantly being called in on my nights off."
bad,"never enough staff, pay was horrible, was hired fulltime but was instantly put on ft temp so didnt qualify for benefits until removed from temp status"
bad,I enjoy meeting new people. I don't meet any strangers and the customers enjoy meeting with me and for me to help them get their supplies. This would be a great job for anyone.
bad,"The manager made promises to me regarding my position, I was a greeter when hired and then became a cashier and eventually moved up to service desk"
bad,"Well, gotta start off by saying I was in the new hire process but ended up not taking the job and it all started with the assistant manager or whoever they are that does the interviewing process (although I would like to name who it is, I won’t say it). If you’re considering applying for the company and end up snagging an interview with Home Depot, be aware that the interviewing process is really fast. The person conducting the interview seems annoyed doing this and will give you weird looks when you answer their questions, or maybe they just didn’t like me for no reason. They are NOT specific enough in what they tell you and they gave me the run around multiple times. I’m not sure how they even got this job, tbh. If it wasn’t for this person, I would’ve ended up loving taking the job."
bad,"This company slowly ruined me! It started out as a great place to work, but with constant turn over and management changes it became a “ too many chiefs not enough Indians,” type of situation. Upper management spent too much time worrying about what you’re doing wrong and not offering any type of help with your opportunities."
bad,"customers were very rude treated you like you were a flea market attendant "
bad,"Worked for 15 years until the company decided to replace experience with kids at probably half the salary. NO COMPANY LOYALTY. You dedicate yourself to making money for the company, and then they let you go."
bad,"This company tries to do well but seems to fail more often than not at accomplishing the desired results.  From my experience, the updated facilities ran exceptionally well but the outdated facilities were poorly run from top to bottom."
bad,The Home Depot get tiring due to the poor management. Pay isn’t that great if you are a hard worker. But the people are friendly. Benefits are trash for part time people. Not to good at scheduling
bad,"I think this job is great as long as your not a manager.  Which I was finding people in departments to help customers was really difficult. Finding items customers wanted is impossible because the stock on the internet is different than what is in the store.  Upper management does not help unless people are willing to wait a few hours.  Although they have a nice break room, 2 fridges and in walking distance of mc donalds. They give out awards for their good employees that are sometimes money."
bad,As a new  department supervisor you are expected to know as much as the assistant managers who have been with the company 10+ years. Each assistant manager task you with different tasks every day contradicting each other. Most managers have no experience with retail and just do as they please as ideas within the store and rarely show up to work. The pay is extremely low and the best way to get a raise is quit and get rehired.
bad,Maintaining shelve and helping customers.  Not alot of opportunity for growth. Great work environment with coworkers.  Terrible management.  Pay was not worth the work
bad,"working for the THD is very stressful and you will need to do a 2/3 man job on the daily which will take a toll on your body don't work here. this one of the worst company to work for they will work you like a slave "
bad,"Very busy department and loved it"
bad,Iam so disappointed in the store promotion process only women get promoted there even if they have no experience the manger seems to favor them . Some of the supretvisors don't deserve the job
bad,"I’m not sure but i think the HR’s schedule the least amount of people as possible, making it very difficult to maintain the entire department. Less cost for the store, more work for you. Maybe this is solely in my store. So this leads to horrible communication which accounts for the long hold times for customers needing assistance. Customers at the depot are no joke. I rank them right under walmart in likeness. To say the least, it’s a stressful job that you aren’t compensated equally for. But i guess that’s work anywhere."
bad,"I enjoyed the experience working there because customers are helpful. Their knowledge of products helps you learn the business to help others. The hours were flexible and allows you plan ahead, even for newbies. There are always fringe benefits offered in the form of incentives. Great Company to work and Develop a Career."
bad,"Home Depot is a great company to work for, however where I worked there were several militant managers who expected you to fear them. It's extremely clickish and if you are not in the in crowd then you are an outcast. It was always understaffed and it wasn't getting any better. Overall the home depot stands for equality and is a great place to work but it is only as strong as its weakest link which is upper management in this case."
bad,"very stagnant days overall. stress potential is high. after about 6 months or so, you'll definitely start considering looking elsewhere for a new job because of the lack of opportunity. associates are definitely underpaid considering the kind of work that is required from them"
bad,"The store I worked at was very disorganized. Management changing frequently, a lot of shortage of associates in departments, it was a mess over all a lot of the time. Store side doesn't mesh well with the MET team."
bad,typical day busy. learned how to drive a forklift. management was not great. workplace culture very fun and enjoyable. nothing hard at all pretty much self explanatory. most enjoyable was the employees
bad,My review of the Home Depot is that the employees are great but the management could use some improvement but I respect the company because they offer so many jobs to people that need them.
bad,"While working at home Depot I received in excess of 90 customer service badges, every third badge was a monetary reward . I enjoy people whether I am operating a forklift walking the floor or operating a reach truck the customer will always supersede what's going on"
bad,"management is not so great. People get promotions for wrong reasons. not much to say, There is no team work because there is always someone brown nosing to get ahead."
bad,"Had the privileged to work with this company for a long period of time as a Department Manager in the Corning/Painted Post Ny store. We went through early years of very professional an well organized management and unfortunately very dark current periods when managers are conniving, deceitful and can not-be trusted to act in the associates best interest. Managers are cliquey and self involved. I loved the company and its ability to transfer to another store but the ultimately the quality of management will decide whether associates prosper or just ""have a job"". Love the company hate the managers in my old store."
bad,The managers at The Home Depot were not involved in the day to day activities of order fulfillment. The building manager was involved whenever possible but the assistant managers were not involved with anything in my department because they did not know about the position. One of the assistant managers would always come up to me while i was working and demand me to do something else that would prevent me from doing my job.
bad,You're constantly being abused by your customers and your Managers will do nothing about it.  Most but not all Managers at the Home Depot enjoys pointing at things to do instead of helping the associates even though they know that they are short staffed.  I say the Home Depot has brought back slavery and Home Depot is the plantation.
bad,"Home depot does not offer barely any room for growth and barely pays their employees anything. I have been here for two years ,and I am more than qualified at this point for a higher ranked position and they will not promote me, I live in one of the most expensive states and I get 12.35 an hour I can barely afford to pay my bills and I have a four year old NOT OKAY!!!"
bad,"This isn’t the same company as it was when I started. Too much regulation and metrics. No focus on customer satisfaction. We need to get back to helping the customer, that’s where the business starts."
bad,Management wasn’t very good they always had there favorites. Associate never helped but always wanted to be helped. Attitudes towards customers were given by manager and some associates in the store.
bad,Management sucks and scheduling is terrible along with no appreciation for how much work you do. Most of the people that work there don't do their own job which leads to the lower powered employees to do all of their work.
bad,"The brinkman home depot has very poor management! I was not the only one complaining about the poor communication with the managers relying on each other to communicate about an associate that needs their assistance. Plus, they're so unprofessional! This was my first and last time in retail... But overall I really enjoyed making my customers happy, I was able to deescalate a lot of  angry customers that I came across and also thank the customer then branded the name every time I was seeing them off."
bad,"Loved working in the beginning but after a few years here, that has changed. management does not know how to communicate. Management also does not care. They preach about family and how important it is but they truely do not care. One of my children got very sick and was hospitalized for weeks and if I did not have the time then I got in trouble. I got put on a final due to all the time I missed to care for my ill child. Homer Fund.. Ya didnt get help from that either."
bad,"There were too many issues with management, pay and hours. Fellow employees were awesome but the rest lacked leadership and consistency. I loved working there but I couldn't live on the pay and there was a definitive lack of knowledge at the Customer Service Counter."
bad,It was a very stressful job and I had to stand outside for hours! the pay was little and I did more work than the people in doors did and they got paid more than me.
bad,the company was ok and they didnt give many hours and want you to be more like them in many was and alllow you to only have so many hours to work but.
bad,"The management was not the best. It was a very slow paced environment. As cashiers, we stood at the end of the aisle, anticipating customers' arrivals. Even during Black Friday it wasn't as busy as one would imagine."
bad,"Most management is nice, however, one took credit for work. If you're really good at your job, you stay there. Hard to move to another Home Depot for management opportunities, even if you are at the top of your field in 1 location and there is no room to be a manager. Even if another manager wants you in their dept., you can't get transferred because of higher-ups. You need to pick within a limited selection of depts. Unrealistic sales goals in an obscure location."
bad,I would stay if I was getting paid fairly. Been working here for over 5 years I know I am one of the best and so do they but our raises are less then 0.30 cents a year.
bad,"The job started off well, there really never was many complaints about my job position. I had the late hours because it was a second job, but I was not given the requested hours I wanted. There was little flexibility with school, hence the late hours. Eventually there were some management changes and things started to go downhill. There were too many issues and I was not getting the respect that I deserved."
bad,I mean let us be real here. home Depot is just another hungry corp and they do not treat their employees well. They can just go out and hire anyone else the next day so why would they.
bad,"Ideas almost never leave whoever you talk to, nothing will change unless someone higher up comes up with them. ZERO accountability, no real on hands training.  Must be a self starter/motivator, in order to advance, which is fine, but next level above you is always worried about you taking their job."
bad,"Home Depot was my first job, as a young person Home Depot is great to learn new skills in Customer service, operations, inventory control and heavy equipment operation, but to move on to a different levels like management it’s a super stressful company to work for."
bad,"I learned you have to stay energized, stay focused, have good memory, work fast, being polite, but also take your time. It was hard, but nobody is perfect, everyone has to learn in their own time."
bad,Would not like to discuss . Retail was a big eye opener after serving in the military for 20 years. its all about business and not about people. But learned a lot from them
bad,"NONE AT ALL.  No such thing as working too much, although they'll say there is.  A ton of growth opportunity but you will burn out very quickly depending on the team."
bad,"I'm a current employee, and within months of working here, that's when I understood that this store was ran by high favoritism (like most retail stores). You can be a hard worker who knows his stuff, but the minute you're disliked by a manager, he/she will do anything to make you quit/transfer. I love the environment, everyday is a learning experience, even customers will show you a thing or two and you'll be surprised with the knowledge. Decent place to socialize with customers/associates if you love to socialize. I know people who worked 20+ years who barely afford apartment rent with little left over. If you're not a supervisor/ASM, don't expect fat paychecks with all the hard work you put in."
bad,You are overworked and there isn't enough pay to get compensated. The goals are unrealistic and the customers are so needy. Managment puts a lot of tasks and stress on their employees and overwork them. They set high goals and stress to meet the numbers that only affect them. They push us to get all these numbers so they can get their bonuses.
bad,"As a former (temporary) lot associate for Home Depot, all I can say is that you are basically the slave drivers for all the departments. If one or the other departments are experiencing problems they'll just call a lot associate which is completely fine it my book, but when it gets to the point where they're making you do simple stuff it just amounts to a lot of work compared to a cashier."
bad,"The Home Depot is a poorly run company that doesn't hold its employees accountable for doing their jobs correctly, making sure standard operating procedures make sense or are followed, time management, or learning about the area they are supposed to work in."
bad,"No compensation for experience. No compensation for making goals."
bad,I prefer something more fulfilling.Typical work day should be more fulfilling.  What I learned could be more fulfilling. The hardest part is standing on the hard concrete all day.
bad,Management is required to interview 3 to 4 people for promotions but they already have who they want picked out for promotions. The pay is not fair for the work you have to do and the raises are very low.
bad,The one thing about Home Depot the pay varies from employee to employee that is not fair. Some of us may know more than the person getting paid more. The person more knowledgeable gets paid less.
bad,"meeting with customers to help them was enjoyable, stocking shelves and organizing stock was challenging but fun. learned to drive a forklift. hardest part of being employed there was not having management support their employees"
bad,"starts off as a great job. if you have any problems with a co-worker and they have more years at the company, management will take there side. then you will be treated unfair for the rest of your employment there. there always hiring because no one wants to stay there. they are more worried about making money then customer service."
bad,"The best part of the job is the people I work with. Management changes constantly. There aren't any store discounts, but there is something called the Homer Fund, where employees give $1 out of every paycheck for fellow employees who fall on hard times. Home Depot matches all those employees who give to the Homer Fund."
bad,"The Home Depot family is very tight. The culture is oriented around giving the customer a good shopping experience. Because of the high volume of customers, the pace of this job was fast."
bad,"As part of the deliveries department, I was tasked with gathering all items requested and paid for in a shipment.  I also had to pack the items in such a way that they could be loaded onto a box truck or flat bed easily and in as few pallets as possible.  As part of the Home Depot family, any customer in any department took priority (not against this policy), no matter how busy you happened to be.  Their questions and concerns were to be addressed before you could continue with your job.  Without an actual location, we were attached to the Pro Desk and assembled the deliveries in the lumber aisle.  This caused many traffic jams in that aisle between the lumber associates and us.  At this particular Home Depot, I was asked to help out in every department by a manager or fellow associate in those departments, sometimes doing the jobs of other employees.  I am all about being a team player but would somehow hard press to find people to help my partner and/or myself.  I have literally carried many heavy items and appliances on my back (including a full size rug, double doors and bathtubs) due to no help and shortages of flat carts.  Many times we would be pulled away from our jobs to help or do other tasks, multiple times in a row.  This would lead to us having 5+ side jobs to complete before we could continue assembling the deliveries, or 1 of us to complete the deliveries.  Our direct manager was sometimes overruled and could do nothing about us getting dragged away for other projects.  The hardest part of the job was staying calm while sweating through your clothes after being"
bad,"buen ambiente de trabajo y compañerismo, pero mala la gente que dirige las tiendas"
bad,Coworkers and most of management was great. Lack of focus on customer service and lack of adequate associates on the sales floor made for a frustrating work load.
bad,"Typical 9 to 5. You deal with a lot of customers through out the day so you must provide good customer service. The management was good overall, very organized."
bad,I believe it depends on the store and the management and people that are working In the store that you apply at. I also feel some departments do not get paid for what they have to do in certain departments.
bad,"Minimal pay increase, ridiculous health insurance fees per paycheck, lots of red tape and jumping through hoops in oder to advance, lots of a** kissing both with customers and supervisors."
bad,I don't really have much to say but it was a tense environment dealing with management after I got injured due to a repetitive use of my hand. Medical bills became my responsibility. There was a sense of prejudice in the company. I hated it but to each is own.
bad,"This company provides good steady employment for a teenager or college student, but I wouldn't suggest it for someone looking to make a career out of it."
bad,"I really enjoyed the associates at Home Depot. It was the management that made it difficult to be there. "
bad,Las Vegas is so diverse that I've learned to assist customers with extreme patients. Home Depot was a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately at my cost the store manager and I didn't see eye to eye.
bad,Due to lack of staff everyone has to work extra hard even outside of there skill level. The turnover rate is aweful! The cashiers are treated the worst due to being the last people to deal with the customers we generally have to ensure that every customer leaves the store happy while we stand the most hours without any relief to sit at any time unless your'e fortunate enough to get a quick break.
bad,Working for Home Depot proved to be quite  boring and slow. The pay for associates would be fair if they gave you a raise at the end of your 90 day probation and another after a year.
bad,"Most fun part is helping  customers and creating order out of chaos."
bad,"10- 12 hour day managing 120 employees"
bad,"this was a good working experience but not for advancement into management, my inter action with co workers was great celebrating of success was good at this company"
bad,The work and pay was decent. Being disrespected by co-workers and having management not believing it to be true was bad. Then since they don't believe you they don't look into it.
bad,the job was good for a while until management started to get iffy and ruin the job experience. the workers were great to work with and hours were good and flexible for my schedule
bad,The are hiring on sales perspective and there are never enough employees on the floor to take care of the business.  They expect too much of the employees working there
bad,"Our department is the one of the busiest in the store. We usually unload 2 trucks a day and sometimes even 3 by hand and with a forklift/electric pallet jack. We're always on a time schedule, our trucks need to be done and out on the sales floor by the time our overnight team arrives. I always come earlier and stay later than any other part time associate. Our management is very bad, our supervisor constantly takes breaks or is using his phone for personal use. I've learned how to use several machines including the sit down forklift, pacer unit and the standard pallet jack."
bad,Too many issues when it comes down to communication. Think about a dog chasing its own tail. The hardest part of the job is the high demand on ones body without proper incentive.
bad,"Management Is Horrible "
bad,Very hard work. Working in Rain and lifting up to 50lbs. worked with some very immature people. The management didnt know what the other was doing on a hour by hour basis. Tell you none thing and do another.
bad,Management could do a better job working with their employees and make sure that everyone is treated equally. There are many times where management tends to treat other differently if the associate speaks up for themselves. Pay is not what it should especially with how hard management pushes their associates to work and under the conditions.
bad,"Started working there part-time. Did a lot of work there achieved full-time employment. After a transfer to another store not so great an experience. Shady management, had trouble going in to grab my check for a few pay periods. Afterward, decided to quit."
bad,"This place is the definition of slave work. You are required to bust your butt for a comical hourly rate. Takes forever to reach your, ""maxed out"" wage which i believe is $17 (2016). Put it this way, it took me five years to get from $11.25 (2010) - $15.00 (2015). The management is a joke. No degree? hey, come on in! No experience? you got the job! What? you kiss butt for a living, you're hired/promoted. Just stay away from this place. Trust me!"
bad,"Home Depot salary Management  use a lot of motivational tactics to excite employees but do not stand by the motivational tools they are promoting. Employee of choice, concept is to attract motivate  and retain a highly motivated diverse work force, actually they keep people who do not want to work and fire people that do work. Complicated as it sounds, their is a buddy system and a certain group gets promoted while they find excuses to fire older employees."
bad,"typical day of work is taking care all customers that walk in. you will learn a lot of how department works together so team work is very strong but management in this store is not good, they are mean to all employees that work the register."
bad,Was miserable when I started as a garden associate. I was constantly sweating from being outside in the summer lifting heavy and usually soaking wet bags of soil and mulch. You can expect to get easily dirtied and tired. Switching to the paint department was a god send. Less grunt work and more interaction with people with a mainly stationary position in the store.
bad,"The employees were very nice to work with, but I would not give you two cents for the management,  The more you did, the more they took advantage of you."
bad,"They want you to be fluent in all departments, workload can be stressful at times, head cashiers are out to get you if you aren't in their favoritism click."
bad,"I learned a lot about the products at Home Depot. "
bad,"hard to explain but struggle a lot seems everyone is for their own."
bad,"great company, competitive pay, excellent benefit program, A company with no limits where a cashier could become a store manager very important they have a tuition program available too."
bad,Aside from management being completely ignorant; this was a great job and I do very much miss it. Working with people who've become friends and the everyday interaction with new people - and sometimes the same customers was fantastic.
bad,During my time at Home Depot I was able to read and relate to the multiple types of customers from Do It Yourself home owners toi the Contractors needs and requirements.
bad,"Home Depot has very high standards for their employees. They expect a lot for very little compensation. Corporate regularly hands down new processes and policies to be followed with absolutely no clue on how it affects the front line workers. I'm regularly cussed out and berated by customers for following these policies that I have no control over and all I'm supposed to do is smile and apologize. Look, I realize that without customers we would have no jobs, but without employees you have no one to help your customers. They preach the founders' mantra, that if employees are taken care of then they in turn will take care of the customers and the rest takes care of itself, but it's not practiced at all. You have to have very tough skin to be able to tolerate the customer abuse and a strong mental resolve to keep going when more keeps getting piled on your plate with less and less resources. I'm a department supervisor with 10-12 employees. I'm given 4 hours a week to do my supervisor duties. An hour and a half of that is our weekly meeting. The rest of the time I'm scheduled as an associate. The people on the corporate ladder have completely lost touch with how the stores really work."
bad,Most people will only get part time work at minimum wage.  Only a select few will be chosen for advancement and then they will constantly have to watch their backs.
bad,"Perfectly good products thrown away every week to provide room for new. Only floors are cleaned not bays or products on shelves. Unhealthy cement dust and fertilizer clouds are always present."
bad,Overnight stock at one of the busiest stores in the nation.  Hard work but employees would always help each other.  Went through a management change towards the end which impacts my judgement.  A good place to work temporarily.
bad,"A job that cuts no corners you have to be prepared ."
bad,i worked at home depot for 5yrs and watched as later employees would move up in the cooperate ladder while id applied and was never interiewed. when i was finally inside i was told i was cross training rather then be put permenantly in the department. it was confusing knowing that i was making the same low pay yet work in multiple departments
bad,"management worried about their own jobs on daily basis so really don't care about yours."
bad,great people hard work normal work day come in clock in load trucks unload trucks 1 hour lunch fun people great mangement no outside life
bad,"Management needs a lot of work. They need to respect employee schedules and different view points. They need to be nicer to customers and be more informed on the products they are selling, or just knowing the store overall."
bad,"THD promotes family and unity, but once you are there it is very divided. They will help when you need it, but the day to day work flow is outrageous. Corporate has impossible expectations."
bad,"Typical day- stocking and customer service."
bad,"Supervisors are fairly compensated but many are set up to fail. Home Depot likes to promote from within, so performance of an outsider is often ignored"
bad,"This was a first job and it was a typical retail position. The people I worked with were very friendly and helpful when I first started. I give props to the people who work retail during the holidays, that's definitely a tough one!"
bad,It was a good place to work management was nice but didn't see any advancement with in the company and didn't have a set schedule.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is my team of associates. We are like a big family and I enjoy seeing them daily. I have been with The Home Depot for 10+ years and I have had ups and downs
bad,"Managing cashiers, and lot associates, working in the vault balancing tills and sending cashiers money when needed. Staffing for the whole store, participating in managers meetings. Working in other departments, learning inventory control. Working with human resources to put on job fairs and put employees through training needed to do there job. Dealing with customers on a daily basis. The hardest part was dealing with new managers and HR watching them show favoritism toward certain employees and bad things happening with the store manager and him being able to keep his job along with Human resources . Then me being harassed by management. I enjoyed working there when we first opened the store the management team was amazing in the beginning and I learned a lot working with many people."
bad,"Management, and clients can be a pain.  Rotating schedule, mostly all clients are angry, more power to you if you need experience in retail"
bad,"When you work with the right manager and employees, your day can seem effortless. Everything runs smoothly because we help each other out. But the hardest part of the job is having no help in your department.  There are some day you just want to walk out."
bad,What can i say about home depot except the fact that it's a place to get everything you need but get absolutely no help at all. I've recently gone into a home depot and i waited more than 30 minutes before getting any help at all sometimes even longer. The management is similar to high school its based on brown nosing points. They don't even educate their employees on the job skills needed to work in the department that they are assigned to. You can't have a life working at home depot because they can schedule you to work late night and than ridiculously have you open the department. I only worked here just because i needed a stepping stone to my next job.
bad,"I love working at The Home Depot. Everyone is very nice, and very helpful. However, there are not very many opportunities for advancement, and most positions are part time. In the winter my hours get cut drastically. The hardest part of the job is wondering if I am going to have enough hours that weeks to pay my bills. As soon as the company starts offering overtime, they take it back. The home depot is a wonderful place to work, as long as there is a second income coming in from somewhere, because they don't hire in full time."
bad,"I think that the company in general is a good company, but the location that I work for absolutely sucks. There is no respect for anyone in the entire store. When I first applied, I thought the pay was pretty good, but for the work you have to do it actually is not enough. They wear women completely out.  I personally feel like women should not have to pick up such heavy objects on a DAILY basis. It really can wear on us because of many factors. We are not males and our bodies physically can't handle certain things. I do think Home Depot is an OKAY company, but the store I worked at gets a negative ONE for me."
bad,"I'm currently a merchandiser for this location. My responsibilities include getting together with vendors to determine specific details on how they'd like their products advertised. I build displays, print tags, down stock items, deep clean, frequently operate the order picker and reach truck, wire and install wall mounted lights as well as ceiling fans, customer service, beam movement and the ordering of needed/missing parts through our computer system. I am paid 45 cents more than minimum wage. If you're okay with a very corporate environment and a whole lot of responsibility than I'd recommend working here. They'll make you feel like family. As for me, my bullsh*t radar is highly tuned. We are understaffed, underpaid, and under appreciated. I get a very eerie brainwash vibe from our monthly training videos and the persistent insistence that we are ""all in this together."" A nice sentiment from a bunch of dead eyed big wigs."
bad,"It's alright if you need a simple part-time job, easy to get in as long as you can pass a drug test."
bad,"My time at Home Depot was an insight into what Managment is suppose to do, and thats not because of excellent work. There was more concern over corporate politics and favouritism then anything else, leaving people at the bottom of the chain either paranoid of making mistakes or so safeguarded by their higher ups that they could do next to nothing for eight hours with no consequence.The only upside is benifits are good for an entry level job. No matter what your work ethic or customer service skill though, Home Depot will make you feel like just another disposible cog in the machine."
bad,"this is a great place to start and the benefits are pretty good but management sucks. they will literary make sure that you cant do anything else but to work there. They say they are very flexible with the schedule but in reality they will put you to work in the most random times and you cant really complain about it. the people currently working there are really nice and easy to get along with, however if management notice that you are too comfortable at work they will change it."
bad,"Check safety of the store, cleaning, doing pack-down, helping customers."
bad,the company was alright to work for. they had some good benefits. we had a lot of company parties and good bonuses. I really grew with the company I learned a lot of good customer service skills. the company showed us employee's that they cared about us by the success sharing party that we had.
bad,"Loved interacting with the public but the demands of the company to sell were more important than their employees. There were days I wouldn't be able to break away from my desk to use the restroom let alone take a lunch hour.  The pressure that management received from above was reflected towards their salespeople, especially the big ticket departments such as kitchen design."
bad,Excellent company to work for. Everyone is very nice. The pay and benefits were great.They had many schedules to work to accomodate you.
bad,"I have more stressful days at The Home Depot than good ones, but I'm always able to make the best out of my situation. I've always been able to deal with people in anyway shape and form, and being at The Home Depot I've learned how to take peoples negativity and do something positive out of it. It's really no hard part of the job, but the most enjoyable part of the job is, being able to help customers and solve problems."
bad,Big warehouse that stayed busy the shifts are good for you if you have another job or going to school.The pay could have been better for the work they want you to do
bad,"The job you are going to get is most likely going to be the one you are going to keep, as even with advancements, at least for me personally, the pay raise was never worth the increase in duties, 40 cents is not enough for me, and not enough for most people when you get a promotion."
bad,"This is a good job if you're trying to get your foot in the door. Other than that, this job does not make for a good career unless you see yourself being in customer service for the rest of your life."
bad,"Home Depot was an awesome part time job in the beginning of my work experience there; there was room to grow, the store manager made it fun and the company seemed to genuinly care about their customers and employies.  However, the company changed policies and switched managers around.  They basically were cleaning house, terminating full time employies for things such as attendence (three strikes you're out) and hired a bunch of part time employies and started paying them less at start and gave less raises.  The company also does not accept hospital or doctors notes and there are no exceptions.  There is an aware line you can call (like I had to do) to have an occurence removed from your record.  This did not just happen at my store but most of the other stores in my district.  The other employies were great unless your supervisor has an issue with you and they also have favorites.  This is definitly more of a man's type of part time job.  I learned alot about plumming, paint, flooring, and gardening.  Its a great summer job, but I do not recomend if looking for a part time job if a full time student or if looking for a full time job period."
bad,"Home Depot can be a fun lively place to work, if you enjoy helping customers to solve household issues. Whether it is in person or over the phone customer assistance come first. However that's the working portion, as far as management goes not so helpful. There is no job security at a place such as Home Depot. The more one does the more management expects of one, without benefit."
bad,"I am the Department Supervisor at The Home Depot. I am in charge of Ordering, Receiving, and Updating P.O's, ensuring all associates are acting in accordance with the SOP and using opportunities to expand my business. I have a staff of 2 Tool Techs and 3 Sales associates."
bad,"A decent job if you're into home repairs or working with your hands, neither of which I am a fan of. There's a good chance of advancement, if you meet the criteria, but that's only if you are willing to sit around for three or so years before getting a full-time package. This is a job for those that have a lot of patience, especially when dealing with customers since in the end it's the customers that have the final word on whether or not you get to keep your job. This became more of a supplemental job for me, and after a while I ended up leaving this job."
bad,If you are a good worker they will work you to death.  There definitely can be a click within the store. Employees gossip like school girls.
bad,"Too many managers not enough communication between them and the stuff."
bad,Enjoy working for the company. Compensation was about that of other company's. Training was a plus..Exceptional management staff and team members.
bad,"It was a challenging position because it lacked direction.  Fast paced environment, good team players.  Stocking shelves, maintaining cleanliness of store."
bad,often understaffed creating stressful work environment and difficulties providing good customer service to customers.  Only part time positions available and very hard to advance.
bad,"Sales floor usually slow.  Learned how to do small in home repairs.  Lack of management presence in the sales floor.  Associates must rely on each other for guidance.  Work environment is harsh, a lot of climbing and lifting required for all assoctiates.  A lot of downtime to walk around the store."
bad,"its a good company to work for, I just believe most of the issues and problems was with the management in the particular store I worked for."
bad,No staff can ever reach Management Expectations. The Company is great and offer good benefits. Management have no idea what is going on within the store except what they are told by supervisors. All staff happy at all times as it is demanded to keep jobs. Job Security is very Low for those who do not constantly check that they are doing great work with the Management. For a non american this is not a good place to work.
bad,"A typical day world start off with doing all the safety checklists for any and all equipment for example - ladders, life equipment like forklifts and reach trucks, sliding power doors and any other safety equipment and power equipment. following this I would collect missing product reports and was responsible for finding any lost product throughout the store. Unloading any incoming product shipments into the receiving area. After products were received delivering product to correct departments for product placement. Product placement. Keeping the parking lot clean and professional looking at all times as well as loading customer purchases into there vehicle's. Gathering any customer orders for deliveries and finally customer service. The most enjoyable part of this job has to be always having something to keep you busy and occupied for during the shift."
bad,Depending on the store and managers is how i would rate home depot. my experience is not a favorable one. Do not rate this store as favorable
bad,"Liked dealing with customers and assisting them.  Associates and supervisor, I managed were great.  Work life balance is not good at all due to irregular retail hours and inconsistent days off.  Store managers, HR managers and District managers tend to have their own click and favorites.  The rest get tossed to the side even though you are a hard worker and your performance is good per your peers and direct reports.  Management will do unethical things (promotions, discrimination and interview process) and bypass policies in place to get what they want.  Complaint to HR but they protect the management level so it does no good."
bad,"Home Depot is a fun professional warehouse atmosphere, there are Lots of different areas to work in and lots of opportunities to gain. my Co workers are very friendly and easy to get along with as well as management on all levels. I have learned how to treat every single person with respect and and try to solve problems quick and efficiently, the most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with customers."
bad,very busy and a lot of interactions with many different people
bad,"Compared to many retail businesses this place comes out favorable.  The trainee is greeted with a warm, welcoming image, and for the most part, it seems sincere; they (meaning the store management team) really do try to make the employees feel like a family.  My kindest comments will be reserved for the assistant and store managers, because in the face of immense pressure from corporate and occasionally troublesome employees they demonstrated humility, tolerance and decency.  "
bad,customer service knowdegement to teach associates how to approach customers and sell the product.
bad,"Management is actually pretty good here, I have had few issues from management. The work is generally pretty simple, and coworkers and customers are mostly quite pleasant."
bad,"Typically you will stock the shelves until 10pm, then clean the store until about 12-2am."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is constant face to face and over the phone interaction with customers. During downtime periods, I try to keep the department clean, and  organized. I am a people's person, so I have a good working and personal relationship with my coworkers. My managers and I have a mutual level of respect for one another, which enables me to have more free range to perform tasks assigned to me in creative ways than more typical traditional methods. The hardest part of the job for me is when customers leave before we can fully assist them. I've learned alot over the years from Home Depot such as people and communication skills, home improvement and maintenance knowledge, and became more business minded."
bad,"working retail is rough especially with this company. if you have a family or other obligations this is not the place to work.. along with any other big box store. "
bad,"This job was mostly just me passing time between my leave from the Army and starting school where I would start getting paid. I mostly spent time learning a little bit here and there about tools and of course, re-learned my skills on a cash register which is always good for keeping my math skills up to par."
bad,"As Delivery Coordinator, it was my responsibility to ensure any and all sales orders were prepared, prepped, and scheduled via contractors, for final destination site delivery. This primarily consisted of large lumber and building materials orders from the contractor services desk for contractors, yet would also include flooring and kitchen sales orders on items bought at the specific store."
bad,"Constant mistakes on paychecks,  Took over two years to get paid for only 3 of those mistakes.  They will  work you to death if you let them.  In 2011, I worked 48 days in a row without a day off, even after constantly asking for one.  Spent 8 days in the hospital, but was put right back on the calendar the very next day after being released while having 10 tubes in my stomach and having lost 30 pounds. They pay less than other companies who offer the same job.  They do not offer gas money or any car allowance while using your personal vehicle to run daily appointments.  A person has to put up with a lot when the job market is slim and trust me, they know it."
bad,"Typical day for me is to diagnosis/repair small engines and hand held tools (blowers, trimmers, table saws, drills). Reaching my production qouta goal everyday of the week. "
bad,"I like my co-workers great people, but the benefits are terrible the money isn't worth the hassle n there isn't a set schedule so its hard to find another job just to make up for the money you are not making."
bad,"stock inventory"
bad,"I was a lot attendent here. It was grueling and back breaking work, with no breaks given."
bad,they pay people pennies to do a back breaking job. Felt bad for part time people cause there hours could be cut without notice. LP often tried to set people up to fail.
bad,"The management team did not seem interested in their employees   Very little training for the job  The hardest part was repairing rental equipment while trying to write contracts, service customers, etc.  The most enjoyable part was customer contact & getting to operate all the rental equipment  Co workers were great & very helpful"
bad,"It was fun and exciting, enjoyed meeting all the new people and talking and learning new things. The day went kind of slow but other than that I made it a good day always. I learned the store and where things were so I could help the customers when they were lost or just could not find what they were looking for. Co Workers were fun to work with we laughed all the time and made the day go by. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was going on break because I would miss the opportunity of helping my customers if no one else was around I always was. Enjoyed meeting them face to face and looking into there eyes and telling them how much I enjoyed helping them and I hoped they would come back."
bad,I learned how to understand the different types of people they are in the world. I learned how to use my patients and understand with many groups of people. I learned how to count many different types of items without separating them. I didn't meet my new manager until 2 weeks after he was hired. My supervisors couldn't understand that I could not work in the early mornings because of nosebleeds I will get in cold weather. 
bad,"Didn't like working at Home Depot at all, the managers are rude to the employees and even some customers, i saw alot of race issues."
bad,U can learn a lot on floor. Depends on management moving to higher position can seems difficult. 
bad,"work was mostly steady, sometimes difficult. Co-workers are mostly a good help depending on who you work with. Hardest part of the job was always trying to accomplish tasks without much help."
bad,Rotating schedule so that every week was different.
bad,"Nice people....but they don't take care of their employees....the greeters are treated poorly....and being a big company, you are at the bottom of their list...which is common, but it still doesn't make it right......."
bad,home depot is a good company. its just had bad management. little recognition for good work. no advancement
bad,Hired as a flooring sales person and then demoted to flooring associate.
bad,I worked pro cashiering with the contractors. Management would get so upset cause I was always joking around or talking to customers. You build relationships friendly ones haha and for the fact that I wouldn't push for a credit card would get me written up. Pay really sucks I knew more and was teaching others how to do their job and they were getting paid more than I was. Management did as they please with me and never talked to me about this. All of a sudden the cared about my long drives to work and decided it was best to take away my full time position and be back onto part time. Which was worse.
bad,Management doesn't seem to care to much about employees. Its a very awkward place for me to work. I learned that they say they want us to put customers first but when we do its an issue. Coworkers have attitudes. The most enjoyable part would have to be the customers.
bad,I have been with Home Depot for 4 years and am trained in 3 departments and have applied many times for many full time positions but it seems impossible to get what I want.
bad,->Management is favoritism to alot of people
bad,"Summer Internship, learned alot about politics,public service and communications."
bad,Everyday at work was redundant. Only certain people were given a chance for advancement everyone else was just stuck in their positions. Very political and a lot of favoritism. It didn't really seem like management cared much about associates it was all about the sales and the bottom line. Sometimes before they even greet you in the morning their giving you work to do as if we were machines and not humans. The hardest part of the job was feeling like I wasn't getting a fair shot at advancement despite all the hard work I did. The most enjoyable part of the job was all of the friendships I developed over the years which helped me get through an otherwise lousy workplace.
bad,this was a great place to learn the kitchen buiness and learn about the products they offered.
bad,I kept on working by myself on weekends and I was expected to help everyone and finish off my own part of the job with no help.
bad,Erratic Hours. Hard work. Not so decent pay.
bad,I think its a good company but it had it's down side. Most of the managers and supervisors were big headed and rude. I liked my co-workers and the hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and the long hours we had to work at the beginning.
bad,"People are great. Customers are a little on the demanding side. But once you know your stuff, it becomes enjoyable. I can't say anything nice about the wage increases. Sometimes less than 2%."
bad,"Overall not a bad company to work for, i think the guidlines between mgmt and supervisor needs to improve."
bad,Working at Home Depot was very fun.The staff is excellent and very welcoming. While working there we recevied 3 new managers within 11 months. Overall Home Depot is an excellent place to work and grow.
bad,"The vast majority of decisions go through the home office in atlanta. This does insure consistency of business practices. By the shear size of the corporation, it is very easy to pass along responsibility with the hopes that there is subsequent synergy and follow-through. My personal perception was that the focus on sales plan overtook what could have otherwise been a concentrated effort to achieve a cohesive company effort."
bad,"I would say that the company is getting better every year to take good care of the customer. Home depot is now focusing on the do it yourselfer more since the home building has declined. I have been there for 10 years now, so I have seen the transition. As any company though, it is not perfect and has a long way to go."
bad,"Home Depot has a lot of rules and SOP's (Standard Operating Procedures), but they only apply them when they want to. Two people can do the same wrong thing on the same day and one will get fired while the other gets a slap on the wrist. It all depends on if they want to keep you or not. You can show the managers the SOP in writing and they'll just say that's not how we do it here. I've worked at two stores and they were both this way, but I'm sure there is at least one different one out there. They keep talking about giving back to the military service members (I'm a veteran), but they will tell you not to remind customers about the military discount. The CEO tells you every month how strong the company is doing, but we still get paid less than Lowe's employees and they let a lot of our part time people go at the end of their 90-120 day 'temp' status."
bad,"For how hard the employees of Home Depot work, both physically and mentally, the compensation is a joke. This goes for all departments, including the front end. The store manager at the time rarely left the back office, to the point where most employees wouldn't know if he was there that day or not."
bad,They didn’t treat me like if I was a person it also put me in a lot of stress for making me staying late and had to get up the next night to work so it got tiring
bad,"Stressful,  not enough staff,  only concerned about the sales/profits. Management people have no training,  just promoted. No communication,  supervisors are constantly pressured with little to no help. I would not reccomend working for Home Depot to anyone."
bad,"At any given time while working at Home Depot, you are scrutinized for every little thing you do. You could do everything you are expected to do and at the end of the day be yelled at for it."
bad,"I believe the company needs to review its"
bad,"I am somewhat happy with my day to day work life, but I cannot afford to continue to work there. Upper management would give away the store to a customer, but I can't get even a 50 cent raise. The people who work there are nice and knowledgeable, and I've learned a lot about home improvement, but I think it's kind of like being stuck in a prison or concentration camp where all of the inmates kind of have to bond with one another to stay sane."
bad,The Home Depot at first was a nice place to work. It might just be my location but after a while people are prejudice towards the minorities that are employed there and really treat them as inferior
bad,Educated managers and assistant managers to work better whit the associates loving respecting them helping achieved our goal as a company and people family
bad,"Drive culture of customer service while directing team to achieve Company initiatives and sales goals. Each day goals set, achieved while leading a productive, fun culture to work in get the results needed for the store.  Running all facets of the store with main direction in driving installation services and hard line sales in seven departments in total sales of over 42 million dollars."
bad,Home depot doesn't care about the employees. They are more focus in making the customers happy. They don't pay well. I hate that Job. You do more than what you get paid for.
bad,The HD only hires part time employees and the pay is minimum wage. Had to find another job to survive. No benefits for part time employees and very little room to advance.
bad,"I have mixed feelings about this company.  I worked there for 5 years, 4 in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and 1 at the Rockland, Maine location.  During my tenure in Ohio I started pt in MET then went store side after one year where I was promoted rather quickly to DS.  That store was amazing, management cared for their associates and we felt that.  I did not feel that at the Maine location.  I ended my career on a sad sour note due to issues with that store and refusal by corporate to help me with the issues I was having.  I ended getting demoted upon transferring and was refused reviews or my former positions."
bad,Great salary but there is no opportunity to separate from work during any part of your 24 hour day.  Culture is very aggressive and does not value associates.  They push and push and expect you to bleed orange.  I had to leave for my sanity.
bad,They didnt pay well enough for the workload that we were expected to complete on a nightly basis. Managment was actually real great to work for..!!! Overnight manager anyway
bad,"This was a while back, but I worked as a seasonal worker in the Garden Center. I did enjoy my job, but requesting time off for school was a nightmare, management seemed to be away at all times, and when my contract was set to expire, I was not NOTIFIED that my contract would not be renewed, I just was suddenly not able to log in to any of the Home Depot programs to see schedules."
bad,"Horrible managers, only 1 of the 7 managers @ my store (SM & ASM both) cared. Most sit in the back & talk/mock their employees. Less than half of the supervisors really cared about their dept & half were buddy buddy with the ASMs so not much help/guidance was offered. Half of the store was drama & thieves. If you’re lucky you’ll meet the coolest, hard working peeps in your dept, that’s on a rare full moon  though."
bad,"Home depot is the best retail Store we have on st.croix but the HR the one who is in charge of the hiring. She is very sacastic and rude,  she hires people who aré Lazy and Not eager to work. She likes to hire people she know.  People who are eager to work and are very persistant , they dont give those people a Fair chance to work .They need a New HR!"
bad,Very hard to do anything out side of work because one day its a opening shift next is a closing shift then back to a opening shift. Interesting days trying to help each customer with their needs of help/questions.
bad,"Poor moral throughout the store"
bad,"Management needed to be better prepared and so did the employees."
bad,"Recent corporate changes have made the culture there more corporate-centric and less in favor of the associates on the floor. "
bad,"Starts with the interview,then the orientation, then you realize that the work is all put upon night crew and day is only customer service oriented and spends all day avoiding said customers. Management only involved when someone with higher 3 letter job title comes through. Communication barely happens and when it does it almost always ends with "" Oh we'll get someone else to do it"". Certain departments are severally understaffed and you rarely have a day were you'll be able to get everything done. Fast in the summer slows down in the winter."
bad,"Great culture, no room for advancement or help to do so. I felt like I had to do everything on my own. I was in a new department and No one was helping me learn. Which was frustrating because I wanted to learn and advance. It became obvious I wasn't in the right role or company so I took a step back and quit."
bad,"While there was a few good managers i either didn't have to deal with them directly and or they moved to different stores shortly after i started. Otherwise store level up to corporate did a good job at throwing cookies and pizza at us instead of giving us realistic time frames because of how understaffed we were, instead of giving us raises when they combined the duties of two different positions into one and expected it to be done in the same amount of time. We were frequently encouraged to ignore safety protocols by one level of management, and then punished by another level when caught. They knowingly hired an alcoholic who would drink on the job and then authorized him to drive pallet jacks and forklifts. This man then went on to be the cause of many accidents (thankfully minor) good for a short term job while looking but i wouldn't recommend staying long. IF you can deal with the bs you will move up, just takes time and always being willing to do the most work. If management(both corporate and store) was better i would have stayed."
bad,"To be fair, the working environment at the Home Depot is positive. People are friendly, managers (mostly) listen, and they mean it when they say they have an open door policy. However, they do not compensate more for machine operators and management does not communicate with one another."
bad,"Homedepot is not a bad company, I previously worked for a homedepot in another location and loved it. Great all around team, management worked with me, the attitude of the store was all around good. Transferred to this store and have had nothing but bad things to say ever since, management is a joke often butting heads with  each other. Drama is like a reality TV show often being the main concern. They also keep around the worst workers and rather just keep complaining then do ANYTHING about it. They only resounding factor is they work with you about your availability"
bad,"Pay was ok but  supervisors ask to much off of one person "
bad,"The daily workload at the Home Depot for the average associate assigned to the sales floor goes easily surpasses the duties and responsibilities found in other comparable large retailers, yet this is not reflected in the pay. This discrepancy is also found between employees within the store. Some employees meet and exceed expectations for work while others either fall below such expectations or have a modest workload to begin with, also not reflected in pay. High turnover rates. No accountability from management."
bad,"The MET team are basically contractors working for $9.75/Hr. RUN AWAY"
bad,I would rather not talk about my employment with Home Depot that is why I am looking for another position.  I work to hard and am getting under paid.  There is favoritism with management.
bad,"The organization itself may have great values but the Thunder Bay management shows a high reluctance for employee welfare. The hours are very irregular, not equally distributed and often there is no time given for proper training but expected the highest service back, There is also a blind eye attitude to complains and grievances as well. However, I must reiterate it is one of the better workplaces in the city but the local office culture is far from the national practice."
bad,"Home depot has no drivers. This is contracted out. They use this to bait and switch new employees. It is really a job where you mostly count and stack lumber. They give 8 hours of work and 4 hours to complete. Meanwhile these 4 hours your helping other employees take large things down. Get stuff from back for pickups. And helping lost customers. You are the most seen employee therefore spend all your time helping customers in every dept. What you dont do is your own job that most be done before store closes. The truck comes at 6am. The loads must be ready."
bad,Management will not even attempt to investigate problems. The employees are always the ones in the wrong and managers can never be wrong. If a customer doesn't like you or thinks your SOP is wrong and it gets to a manager you will be written up without investigation or rebuttal to the accusation.
bad,"management was not the best and was quite mean to most of its workers, most of the hours were consistent but so much work has to be put in because the job itself was always understaffed"
bad,"this place went down the drain in my opinion after the original owners left. they in my opinion place people in positions on the store level who arent qualified ,"
bad,"If you wish to work here part time, DONT because you will literally sit around and do nothing when it isn't time for the holidays. You would be better off working at a supermarket part time."
bad,"Poor management. Culture is Good but very disorganized company to work at. Have been in several stores working and/or visiting and it looks like the same pattern persists. Few opportunities for career advancement, and the ones there, are usually given to the laziest people because of friendship,  or family members working together, which by the way it violates policy.Thus pushing good employees out to look for a place where they are appreciated. Learned a lot of skills there. Enjoyed the daily helping  customers, and got awards that gained me a watch I never received. Awards that by the way are given by customers' appreciation comments to management and not by management itself."
bad,good company.  Great people.  Decent benefits. Typical day includes stocking shelves and assisting customers in selection of proper products for the job.
bad,There are a lot of good people working there... but it's unacceptable to work for $11 an hour for very physical labor when places like Chick Fil A start you at $14 an hour.
bad,The people you work with are genuinly great and making friends is easy. Many people do not end up doing good work and it can be hard to do your job. the store is always a mess. You are required to do everyone elses job and no one gets reprimanded for not doing their job.
bad,Good company to work for if you are part time.  You learn a lot and it can be fun.  Management is by far the worst I've ever seen.  They ride the good workers and stress them out and let the bad workers do nothing all day.  If you question anything they threaten you
bad,The managers there are horrible and they have a lot of problems with there sercuity. It’s a lot of stuff to do at the store and there be times everything goes good.
bad,"Home Depot wasn't a bad place to work for, but no man can make it working for minimum wage.  They aren't good at giving raises or promotions.  I didn't enjoy working there."
bad,"This place was a hectic place to work. It was always busy, management was always all over the place. Always a high turn over. Never enough people to do jobs, however work kept coming in."
bad,"My coworkers learn from the bad behavior of our DH."
bad,"I loved working here. My coworkers were great, fun people. My supervisors and a few managers were very nice and understanding as well as reliable. Customers were kind of jerks, but it's retail. What else could you expect?"
bad,I enjoyed my time at home depot. there is always something to do although my favorites were driving the forklifts around.We had good managers and bad ones.The hardest part was the concrete aisle
bad,"I enjoyed my time w Home Depot .. My only issues were the lack of communication between all of the managers and one of the supes always had a chip on his shoulder so would pick at me every single night which still tonthis day; I have NO IDEA why he treated me the way he did becouse I'm a very hard worker who ALWAYZ went above & beyond self & company expectations while also Earning 3 ""Homer Awards"" which is DEF No Easy Task but other then that I have no regrets.. Decent pay and cross train you in all departments.."
bad,"As a cashier, the job is fairly simple.  When you move from the front end to the aisles the job becomes more demanding.  Especially recently, they have had a purposefully marked lack of staff, putting more demand upon those who are working, causing stress levels to skyrocket and more and more associates to look for different careers to pursue.  If the scheduling hadn't been so messy, the job would be great, but with the current scheduling situation it's too much to handle."
bad,Home Depot is a fair company to work for. IF the right management team is in place. It can be a cutthroat environment. The main goal is to provide the best customer service. They will help you with that!!!!
bad,"When I first got hired on with Home Depot I was part of the freight team I was one of the better associates that throughout freight fast but I moved to the dayshift because we had too many people that will just come in and sit on their phones and wouldn't work so I started working cashier, they have really awesome working with my my schedule and the things that I need to do with my daily life. I was transferred to Pensacola and I went from working 40 to 50 hours a week to 8 to 19"
bad,Work is hard  and sometimes rewarding. Management could use a few tweaks but the benefits packages they offer are worth while however part time employees will barely make enough to remotely even think of investing.
bad,Disappointing  and stressful. Worked my butt off while others did not. Now that the industry  is online mainly things are worse. Internet make mistakes that humans  are less likely to make.
bad,"The Home depot was a great employer when I started. You could not find better benefits, especially for part time work. Once you got higher than store level though there was no accountability from anyone. This led to the hard workers giving up because they got tired of picking up slack from the others."
bad,"Cashier get it tough there, only time you'll even get close to full-time hours is May-Sep after that expect to be laid off or your hours cut to 12 or less."
bad,The home depot need s to pay more money. There wages aren't competitive for the area. They should promote within the company as well.  Employees arent appreciated.
bad,"great environment , usually walk around dept. to see if what needed to be work on. greet customers that pass by resolve issues if customers need help."
bad,"Unfortunate that they do not offer FT employment and with such a low hourly wage the number of employees on public assistance is disappointing."
bad,"i loved it but the favoritism was too upsetting. if a manager liked you, it was nice but if they didnt you knew.  getting paid the least of all supervisors/being the only part time supervisor with higher evaluations. $400 a paycheck to be made feel terrible isnt worth it."
bad,"never a dull moment at home depot. no job advancement unless you were a family member or a female."
bad,My experience at the Home Depot started off great I love learning new things and taking care of our customers. But on the other hand as the years progress working for Home Depot management change and start to run the store itself as they wanted and not by SOP. The job itself is exciting but the management is very unprofessional.
bad,"great place if you can get full time otherwise its too difficult to raise a family on 1 or 2 days a week .....very nice people to work with ,great exercise,learned a lot about unloading trucks and placing on shelves"
bad,"Management was inconsistent on priorities and unrealistic about level of effort required to perform my job. Hiring of adequately knowledgeable staff was not a priority. Additionally, management was short sighted and would rather put a quick fix bandaid and never thought big picture."
bad,I didn't really enjoy working at The Home Depot. The job was extremely mundane and I caught myself becoming very exhausted due to a lack of mental activity. That is work though.
bad,Being a cashier is a easy job to do. They hire people of all different races. Love the other cashiers I work with. They are friendly and easy to get along with. Management is okay. Don't appreciate the front end enough.
bad,Home Depot is an ok company only thing is they don't hire full time and they will do whatever they can to keep from making you full time and then they don't give proper raises which I feel is very messed up
bad,"I started this job at a young age, if you are a yes man or woman you could be what they call a lifer. which isn't a bad thing, its hard to plan family functions and other things with an ever changing schedule."
bad,good people bad in pay lack of on time work loads they need to do better with paying people that work up to there goals in the store and or bring busy to the store like discounts on products or more paid time off
bad,It is a good place to start at especially if you are going to school. They will work around your school schedule but if you find a opportunity elsewhere then you should take it. They barely give you a raise. Moral of the story if you get in stay just until you find a better place to work at.
bad,"My experience at Home Depot can be described as stressful. The management did a good job with what they had to work with. That being said, it is hard for a college student to make a schedule for three weeks in advance. It makes it hard for us to make plans."
bad,"The Home Depot is great if you're not in a part-time position. If you are then good luck getting enough hours. There are a lot of complaints going around the store that associates are not getting enough hours and they continue to hire more people instead of boosting up the hours for those of us who want them. Another bad thing about the company is that everyone gets paid the same. I started when associates got paid more than cashiers and that was great because we were doing more work than the cashiers were. NOW, both get paid the same and they still expect the associates to cashier, assist customers, and everything else the job entails."
bad,"The job is fair but the management at my particular location is passive aggressive and micromanages everything.  They worked with me around my class schedule, but I got hurt on the job and since have been more and more aggressive towards me.  Also, continually scheduled me outside my availability and many more hours than that was agreed upon.  Lowe's pays much better."
bad,"Just loud, noisy, management is unprofessional, messy, its a clean place and environment, but the people are nasty and rude and very very unprofessional"
bad,The low pay makes it hard to afford to stay with this company for very long. There is some room for advancement within the company but the low pay increases do not correlate with the significant increase in responsibility. Most positions don't even have an option to negotiate pay either.
bad,They have a nice management team they treat everyone fairly and equal. The pay just wasnt enough for me so I had to seek better employment and also a long drive from home.
bad,"under staffed almost every day, managers hate to promote from within and take their time hiring new employees. Good benefits for part timers. Decent starting pay but not many chances to make more."
bad,"Two managers were good, two were bad. The bad two outweighed the good ones. Two of the managers in LK Zurich were Very Disrespectful towards me. One even yelled at me for arguing when in fact I was  agreeing with her ( what a dumd As*)."
bad,simple enough place to work. Managers want to push goals and achieve many things but don't provide the staff to do so. You can easily find yourself getting overwhelmed doing many different jobs with many responsibilities the ore you learn at the Home Depot. Becomes a burden while you are being under paid and under valued altogether. There is space to move up in the company but it's hard. May take a long time as much as they may make it seem difficult. It requires no professional background or degree to move to a high position. You can learn everything you need to just being an employee.
bad,"Its a cool job but sometimes the management weren't  organized and their supervisor weren't living up to there title , I was running two departments without my supervisor there everyday"
bad,"great job but sometimes the pay just doesnt compensate with the amount of work they put on an empolyee. the work environment is great, but with the minimum wage finally surpassing my pay after 3 years of working at the Home Depot, there is no reason why I should work a supervisor job at base pay."
bad,I was Project Specialist. Walked floor all day seeking leads for homes.  I was in charge of training all of Home Depot employees on how to get leads and held them to the standards of customer service in all Departments.
bad,Dont get me wrong i enjoyed my work but i was bored out of mind .i cant stand on my feet to long but i did enjoy begin greeeter and helping out the custoners that came in.
bad,"Would not acknowledge suggestion for improvement even if it concerned safety. Management/supervision did not communicate to the employees, especially when it came to training in other areas. One major problem, mamagement/supervision showed favoritism toward certain emplorees and supervisors. The Middleburg, Florida Home Depot did not seem to work as a team and was unsystematic."
bad,Home depot stores suck for growth and development. if you can get into corporate that is where you can grow. the culture is great and competitive.  An good company for learning lessons
bad,"I learned where everything was for customers, I worked hard, I helped customers and they seemed to like me. I got a few compliments from customers I applied for Garden but I had to know the whole store. The trainer I had was rude and yelled at me."
bad,"Normal employees are amazing to work with, customers are nice and reasonable even in the bad times, yet management has a quota to place blame and lay employees off when a smallest of metric has not been met. I worked for the top store in the district and saw so many people get let go for the most petty reasons. Years of work, hundreds of happy return customers, and untold skill mean nothing when you do not meet a metric that the customer has no clue or care about."
bad,"When it came to the workers that I worked with, The Home Depot was great. My supervisor of the department I was in was the living embodiment of what retail employees and leaders should be. He  helped everybody out and defended his workers from the corruption and anger of the management team. Now the management team when I was there was the worst. The lead manager cared only about one thing and that was impressing her higher ups. She was horrible and so were he assistant mangers. They were mean, unhelpful, and did not know anything about the store."
bad,"I didn't like it, the managers and co-workers were rude and I didn't get to learn anything while on the job that I wish I did that would have helped me progress. I was just thrown into a nigh shift position, tried to change it , but I couldn't. I hated my position also because it was incredibly repetitive just going back and forth. I'm glad I had quit."
bad,Patrons were great. Most associates kept to themselves. Fantastic place to learn about home construction. The hardest part of the job was ordering the correct and right amount of a certain product for consumer needs.
bad,Home Depot is a very hard place to work if you work overnight on the freight team. I feel that they underpay there workers for all the labor we do. Not for all stores but i feel that the management was not fair about promoting the right people I felt like they would pick the ones who they know the best but not the best one qualified for the job. All in all I was thankful for the opportunity to work and I also learned a lot of skills and meant great people who I am still friends with today.
bad,"Home Depot used to be a great place to work when it was owned by the men who started it. When they sold out and it is now run by a CEO and board of directors and while the stock price is up there I have to wonder why because most of the people that you speak to will tell you that is a ""job"". They don't enjoy it as much, they do what they do to pay the bills"
bad,Home Depot is not a great place to work.  There compensation is not strong and they really don't seem to have any interest in listening to or taking there employees seriously when they make suggestions
bad,"not the worst place to work but your constantly on your feet and your schedule varys every week. management is okay, customers can be a handful sometimes"
bad,"Management at the location I worked at was unorganized. There would be days when they were not in uniform, eating on the clock, ignoring paged announcements etc. They also displayed favoritism."
bad,"I have worked for the Home Depot for the past two years,and in my estimation,it is a solid place to work.I enjoy my interaction with customers,and the response,feedback that they have given me has been positive."
bad,"good work, good people but management does not care about associates. very laid back job and good tradition withing associates most management, will not work with you when you have a problem. but good business overall. and good people mostly."
bad,"Personal experience with the store I worked in, it was terrible. The managers all had favorites, job advancement was next to none, and the supervisors were all too strict. Too much personal stuff in the workplace and everyone had something bad to say about to someone. There was too much of that going on and not enough working.  I liked most of my co-workers pretty well. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to meet the goals of my supervisors and those goals were impossible."
bad,"Have the availability to learn more as long as someone is there to teach you. Clean, organize, inventory, stock, assemble, make signs, lift up to 90 pounds but the requirement is only 50 pounds , drive fork lift and reach truck for floor positions, use scanning system, learn about safety and HAZMAT, and much more."
bad,"I love Home Depot been there many years, but management has change for the worst, its to much favoritism and too many chiefs and not enough Indians. It not what you know it who you know.  I come to work to do a job and most people come for a pay check, it change."
bad,"pay could be better, Management is iffy at times. employees are very nice cultured up beat and positive. They Do have good programs to help out their employees. Homer fun, Dollar dog day every friday, working in the heat no cold water is the hardest part."
bad,"You cannot stop people from stealing, which happens. You cannot help customers very often as you get in trouble for leaving your cash register despite the fact that no associates have been helping the person. I've learned to be polite and to work at the cash register and returns desk. The most enjoyable and hardest part of the job is helping customers in areas you have yet to fully understand."
bad,"I was in a slower paced store, so typically if you opened at 6am you would be alone until 12:30pm before your next person came in. You stayed busy between customers and task.  Overall a fun place to work and if you called management for help they would get someone to help you."
bad,"As a cashier you are not a valued employee."
bad,"I enjoyed working there, but after a transfer to a new department, I found myself suddenly unappreciated by my new department head, and was ultimately forced to leave."
bad,okay just a job verystressful at times always  busy helping the cashiers every thing was pretty much difficult getting hurt with different objects at time on register ;lifting heavy object to but I did what I had to do.
bad,"8 hour shifts also usually"
bad,flooring shipping stacking moving product selling flooring
bad,"Fair amount of grunt work."
bad,"Regularly stock palletized merchandise."
bad,"learned a lot of knowledge, worked with a nice people, management was not fear with me, a very good co-workers, the hardest part of the job is being fired in a way that no-one can imagine, the most enjoyable part of the job is earned people love"
bad,"Fast paced work environment, constantly meeting new people, building relationships- sales, quotas..."
bad,I'm just a part time cashier looking to expand my growth for my future career.
bad,"Sucks. They do not care about employees. Big box retail issues, have to deal with rude customers."
bad,"Long hours, not much work and life balance. Do it for the pay."
bad,"Overall if you can get pass the bad, and counting on the store you work for Management changes both structure wise and rule wise. I learned a lot about retail and management from them."
bad,"A typical day for me was if I worked a 7-3:30 shift, I would walk in walk past the opening Head Cashier with a friendly "" Good Morning "", and I would clock in get my apron on and return to the front end for my assigned checkout. "
bad,"illusions of promotion. Hardly had any weekends off. Probably on had 3 weekends off the whole time i worked there. Great people, management on the other needed more structure."
bad,"- worked 25- 30 hrs/ wk"
bad,I do not wish to write a review at this time on this business. Ok fair company to work for!!!!!!!!!
bad,"I was in charge of the department for custom window treatments.  I cut and ordered window treatments for customers and trained fellow employees to do the same.  The hardest part of the job for me was taking down large 8 -10ft long boxes weighing 50 to 75lbs using an electric ladder.  It was very difficult.  The men working in the store would seldom help you and indeed would stand and watch you do difficult things, but at the same time expect you to help them which I did.  I loved my job except for this."
bad,i was moping sometimes but i was hire for puting boxes together what they needed me to do i did it iam there to work not playing around!
bad,"productive but with larger jobs to do that took alot of time, i learned alot about different departments i worked in. the most enjoyable part of the job hosting classes for remodeling for customers"
bad,"Customer service is #1 at The Home Depot. Going out and seeking customers to help, special ordering, organizing, cleaning and down stocking. I get along with everyone, but a lot come and go, so it's hard to make lasting relationships. I enjoy interacting with people on a daily basis. "
bad,"Too often the primarily concern is numbers and not people. There is a systemic inconsistency between various levels of management and corporate instructions. It is more that that left hand doesn't know that there is a right hand, than that it doesn't know what the other hand is doing. "
bad,"This company really takes care of the associates, but the management is overstressed, and ends up taking it out on the associates"
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job is the rewarding experiences with customers. Most stressful part is when management fires associates and piles work onto the remaining people. Coworkers are awesome, learned that retail is retail. It is no place for a legitimately good designer who wants a fun, creative environment."
bad,asked to help the Night Shift for a few weeks. could'nt get off of that shift for three years. neverb again!
bad,"Managers seemed to hate their jobs, in turn making everyone else miserable. I met a lot of great people there but the stress is not worth the compensation."
bad,"There is a lot of good at home depot. Good customer service ethic, great staff. Pay is very POOR. this is a review for the Department supervisor. Expectations are way too high to even get the job done. You have to spend a couple of hours a day doing store manager duty and are expected to still get your own department's work done. Store is often short-staffed and due to the customer service ethic, DS's often have to cover in all the departments. Then, when you don't get your work done, you get in trouble. Really? If you want to work at Home Depot, be an associate, not a supervisor."
bad,"I love my customers. I love helping people and interacting. I have learned so much from co-workers, supervisors and even customers. I think customers teach you the most, after all, they are the ones using half of the products that you are selling on a day to day basis. I do not agree with management and the way they handle certain issues or how crooked some of them can be. They write associates up for the dumbest reasons, just to cover up an issue that could have been delt with in a better manner. I love my co-workers, most of them will give the shirt off their back to help you, even if it is 100 degrees outside."
bad,"Working on the floor is demanding but do-able if you are in shape and a go getter. My co-workers that I experienced were all very unhappy with thier jobs and complained alot, which would bring others down in morale. There are positions in each store that do not require physical strength but they are few and hard to get. The most enjoyabe part of each day is the customer."
bad,"At The Home Depot, each day is like every other day. As a cashier you clock in, get your apron on and stand infront waiting for customers who need to be checked- out. I've learn may skills from working in a team to learning what supplies are needed for certain projects that people are starting... The part I mainly like is my co-workers, they are always cheerful and always the work place to flow with a good vibe for all workers and shoppers. However, I truly dislike doing the same thing over and over and feeling so useless."
bad,The job was ok but the management did not follow there store values.
bad,Home Depot is consistently cutting part-time associate's hours. They guarantee no hours and you can have as little as four hours per week. Do not apply at Home Depot unless it is additional income. They want you to be versatile but do not reciprocate. Additionally. training is hands on and you may never work with someone who can show you the ropes. The health benefits are good if you can hang on for three months before you can apply.
bad,"you can only cut so many hours until your unemployed, working at home depot is okay at best, some people get full time with benefits while other get 23 to maybe 25 hours a week with strange hours, it is really hard to balance work and life. i either have to get a second job or find a better job."
bad,"I think it is a good company,they could treat there people a lot bettter,the hrs and the pay need a lot to be desired."
bad,The employees not treated with respect and talked to like  people are stupid.There is no patience or eagerness to teach people.I will say there is understanding when it comes to family issues.
bad,You can't really do much with your schedule. It all has to be on their time. They started to ask for too much of the cashiers in terms of credits and recoveries.
bad,Working at home depot had its ups and downs. Customers were sometimes rude and some were absolutely amazing. Some of the head cashiers had a huge ego and think that they are better than everyone else and there were some who were kind and understanding.
bad,The job itself was a lot of work for minimal pay. Not a lot of growth in the company that i saw in my time there. Management seemed to be on different pages constantly about the work they wanted done.
bad,Working at the Home Depot help expand my experience in customer service They were flexible with my schedule. But two years is too long to stay at a job that pays minimum wage
bad,Trabajo muy estresante muchas responsabilidades poco sueldo
bad,I resigned because of lack of opportunities to advance and the robot mentality of the employees.  Now I work at a local home depot competitor and hear daily from customers how much they dislike home depot and the lack of customer service they have received every time they were forced to go there for something.  I don't know how this store stays in business.  They do not treat their customers right.
bad,"stressful work environment. I got depression while working at the home depot, Toronto. they are super nice during the interview but the moment you have spent a couple of weeks, they treat you as a robot no a human."
bad,"Overall this is not a bad place. Fun, friendly people. Only issue is hard to support a family on a low wage. Not a bad job for someone coming out of high school"
bad,Grateful for the opportunity at the time... I went through WorkFaith Connection which is a Godsent Program that I recommend for anyone faithfully needing employment seeking skills
bad,people are great at the home depot. very helpful management but the work is as you are just a number. it is all about metrics and personal strengths will not be seen.
bad,Not a good job dont work at this job everyone is lazy and the management is bad. there are nice people that work there but everyone is bad at their job
bad,"It's not a bad job. It's a good place to get to know people and have a start, but you cant really progress unless you are favorited. The other employees are not bad but there is gossip and drama."
bad,It was ok hours and shifts are available the job isn’t for everyone the management is helpful and will keep you on your toes at all times just make sure to do your job
bad,"While working at the Van Nuys, CA location from 2014-2017 I was going to college and working part time. I averaged 32 hours a week and the work we did was back breaking. The Lumber and Building Departments were constantly filled with contractors who wanted things done immediately. Sometimes being shore staffed and management that did not want to help was always a concern."
bad,Home Depot is a good place to work as long as you want minimum wage and part time hours. I would not recommend Home Depot if you're looking for a career. Training is good.
bad,The biggest thing about Home Depot is that they’re always toting that they care about their employees when in fact they truly do not. They care more about the customer survey that can be presented to stockholders then they care about their actual in store employees. They pay minimum wage . I’ve been there for 3 years and new employees are coming at .10 less than what I’m making.
bad,"I really enjoyed my coworkers, and learned a lot from them. The knowledge I learned from them to go along with my what I already knew helped me with answering customers questions."
bad,If you weren’t in good with management you stuck doing the same thing over an over. Not something for the long run but a quick job if needed I guess so
bad,They hire way too many employees and get 16 to 20 hrs a week and very little benefits.  When opportunities come up they do not look at seniority at all or praise you for your hard work ever.  Been there 3 years and only one raise and hard to get respect or move up in the company.  I love my job that's about it.
bad,"It would have been a grate job if wasn't one side race."
bad,As a college student i though this was going to be a good job. When school started i was scheduled to come into work everyday that i was supposed to be in school. It took me talking to the manager three times in a row to get this issue fixed. There was always drama in my department. I was a cashier and if the head cashiers got mad at you they would send you away to garden or lumber for the whole day instead of cycling everyone through like they are supposed to.
bad,The position lacked training and procedures.  there were significant conflicts between store management and corporate policies. Entry level provides typical pay and benefits for retail box stores.
bad,"Working in the merchandising department for Home Depot consists of hard labor, attention to detail and adaptation to a stressful work environment. Customer service is also a part of the position as you will be asked for assistance from customers. The hours are generally based on a set schedule."
bad,What do you want me to say?  I keep trying to get my new resume in place and you keep requiring this stupid stuff that has nothing to do with me finding a new job.
bad,Underpaid and overworked. Micromanaged and management has no respect. The one In Richmond va  is better every place has drama but management is better there
bad,If they paid more it wouldn't be to bad of a job. You soak up a lot more knowledge while working on the floor. I did anyway. The computer training isnt to great. My coworker's there were awesome. I learned so much working there. That was my favorite thing about working there. I'd recommend it if you plan on moving up in the company or part time for students. Other then that you'll need another job to make ends meet.
bad,"I worked long hours and was very committed to the Company.  I hardly missed a day.  Maybe one day in the five years I missed.  It was few.  Managers lacked leadership skills.  Not very personal or engaging with employees.  i left even though i didn't have a job at that time.  The pay is inadequate for the work, hours and leadership lacking skills.  Maybe, they are getting the same treatment from above.  I don't know but that's not good if you want to keep good people.  i think if you are older that they  can treat you badly because you may need a job.   Not good.  The Head Offices should consider surveying employees, conducting exit interviews, and visit one-one-one with all employees (listen too) to find out how they feel about leaders and the organization as a whole.  My manager didn't want to listen or engage.  Leadership training with performance evaluations to include KPI's may help retain employees.  Pay is not competitive.  Retention is a method of measurement for leadership.  Turnover not good!  There are a lot of jobs out there and I would recommend to any of my friends not to work at Home Depot. I like the product, organization of the store, customer service, etc. It was primarily leadership for my reason to leave.   Please note that my position title and time of service (except for years) may not be correct.  I wanted to protect myself from any type of retaliation.  I have witnessed that a few times as well.  I know honesty is the best."
bad,"I get hired on for FUll-time overnight freight, ended up getting thrown in garden recovery, seasonal/tempory. "
bad,I took a department manger position when I went through a slow work period. Pay did not match my worth not to mention it’s not a livable wage for anyone. They are not hiring knowledgeable candidates witch adds to stressful situations when you are the only person in the store with plumbing and electric skills. Then the store manager doubled my duties by making me the manager of both electrical and plumbing my pay increase 15 cents an hour. Sad that such a successful company can’t pay for good employees
bad,They did not have enough employees and did not hire any new people while I was there. We as employees were over worked. The manager of the store is also very unappreciative of the work done by the employees.
bad,"Great place for someone looking for part time work,if you have another job or don't care loosing your job.home Depot fire many employee even after working for them over 20yrs,they just don't care that all....."
bad,"There is way too much enfasis on the customers and money at home Depot, and very little on the associates who make their company what they are. If a customer reports you, you have a 85% chance of getting terminated. The management is also disappointing. Many times they tell you to work over time or more days that your schedule states because they don't have enough employees. You could find yourself have to run an entire department by yourself for three hours"
bad,"Your hours will be inconsistent no matter what you tell them. Youll work in the evening then open the next morning. Not to mention the amount of hours that you get one week to the next are never consistent. "
bad,it's fine. it's a job and the pay is not that bad. management is a little messy but that will vary from store to store. Corporate will put policies in place that makes absolutely no sense to the people who actually have to implement them
bad,Having to help multiple customers and having them get angry cause your by yourself (lack of workers/sick calls) and when you ask managers for help they are always busy or doing something in the office
bad,"What easily makes The Home Depot great to work at are the coworkers. However it is a very stress inducing environment. The physical labor that's demanded alone can be tough, combine that with irritable contractors and impossible to please management and it quickly turns into a recipe for disaster."
bad,"Low pay for skills, stagnant work culture, will take advantage of employees, benefits not  modern, promote within pol. leads to favoritism and gossip."
bad,They told me I would get paid a higher amount when they hired me but it was actually a half dollar less. They wouldn't let us work more hours. Anti union propaganda was about half our training.
bad,"Home depot is a fun and great company to work for. They just don't pay well at all. If your a mail then you'll enjoy the opportunity to get all the exercise you will ever want  and then allot more at the customer loading bay where you'll have the opportunity to load concrete, refrigerators, tool cabinets, plywood, drywall and fence panels."
bad,"I worked at my local Home Depot for about 7 months. In those 7 months I was poorly trained and written up because of my mistakes. My supervisor chose to demonize me for those mistakes rather than pull me aside to correct me. The environment was politically hostile, however other departments were much nicer."
bad,Corporate dose not do the homework to determine what is needed for the tool rental department so you get the wrong supplies. When I left a not that I thought would help about getting the wrong supplies I just got a nuther ordered of the same to thing 2 months later
bad,Decent job and the work was ok. I really don't agree with this because I don't plan on working there again.  I don't understand the relavance of this.
bad,This is a job where you can start and learn a lot of different skills to apply at a lot of other jobs so it's good in that detail but as far as pay goes it's just average
bad,"I am working at the federal way home Depot in Boise. While the job itself is great, the employees definitely have their own cliques and tend to be intolerant of new employees and become frustrated quite easily. I've been here for about a month And honestly I'm questioning whether or not I want to stick it out. The training process is great, the management is ""okay"", the pay is a bit low but there's definitely room for advancement...but again...the employees are rude to newcomers."
bad,"Home Depot is not a work / life friendly company. If you can give your entire life to your job, this is a company for you. However, most people have a life and family and some have medical problems. If this is you, you will find yourself at the short end of the stick."
bad,"I would work for home depot again just preferably not at the location I previously worked at for the most part it is a well run company, but the management structure at the local store is not approachable and there is a clear clique mentality on site the people at the below management label are all good people and great to work with"
bad,"I've been working with the night merchandising team for over a year now and the rotation of staff is very telling as to how grueling the work can be. Basically, we got paid the same as store employees despite being overnight and working 10+ hour days on very physically demanding projects that the day team often does not have to do. Now I have worked store side before this and when I say the night team does not get enough appreciation and pay for what they do, I absolutely mean it. Many of my team members end up with HUGE overtime to finish projects at the end of the day that they are forced to cut at the end of the week. And this is a common and expected practice within the team. Once, a coworker voluntarily stayed 7 hours over to finish a project. That's a 17-hour shift! How is that legal?? The management is honestly pretty weak and morale is often low. They often push us to do the impossible and to finish projects within a set amount of time. We are not appreciated by the stores we service or corporate and I would not recommend this position to anyone unless they enjoy getting treated like a robot. The only benefit is the fixed Mon-Thur schedule and the paid vacation and sick days off but that's about it."
bad,"Bad hours, minimum wage, slow work environment. Not a recommended place no pay increases and also no medical insurance, no dental not for me no room for envancemet."
bad,"I would work as a Lot associate and every day i came to clock in the Lot was never clean prior to the past associate, so when i would start working the managers and others would think it was my fault. I wish management was more strict on that because i would only get in trouble because the other associates wouldn’t work. The hardest part of my job was the weather, when it was so cold that you couldn’t feel your hands, or so hot where you feel dizzy, they best part of my job was when the day was almost over, because you can work at your own pace and it was more relaxing."
bad,"friendly working environment "
bad,"Some of the managers are cool, some arent. Some are super harsh and expect you to work 24/7 with basically no water breaks. if you work here, DONT WORK OUTSIDE!"
bad,I worked in Houston Texas at the time I loved the people and Home depot because it was pleasant and it felt like family I loved working as the bookkeeper because I had my own space and I felt important
bad,A typical day in this place is not always going to be the same every day.  I work in the lumber department . One day it can be very busy and the next can be very slow but it all depends on the weather at times. There can be days where it is stressful and you don't think the pay is enough. This department its not the best but that varies from departments not only by departments but also from locations
bad,"High turnover rate. Its good if you are in school because they will work around your school schedule. Departments are often under staffed, leading to stress."
bad,its sad that the Home depot being such a big company would play its employees so dirty. low hours just so they didn't have to pay out benefits. And what they continue to do.
bad,"it would be good job if you could get the hours needed to survive in life, but the hours they give you can;t get a second job because of the mid day hours or the hour switch up the planner gives you or trys to force you to do even when you explan to them you had to get a second job to support your kid and they dont work with you either way better planning is needed"
bad,"Customer service, ringing customer out, clean the front end of the store, greeting customers when they come into the store, take out the front end trash at the end of the night"
bad,"The Home Depot was an okay place to work. They do put a lot of effort into teaching you about the business but at the end of the day, they want you to stretch yourself to the max with little to no benefit. I left the company for their direct competitor and took a lesser position but got paid more than what I was making as a member of management with HD. Of course, there were other, more store specific reasons, why I left, but still. Being short staffed and under paying employees is a recipe for disaster."
bad,would prefer not to work in retail again because of all the stress I had to deal with day to day and the work shifts. Retail is very stressful especially when you have to deal with unfair store managers.
bad,i worked there for 2 years. they would constantly hire new workers that were unskilled in what they were doing rather than just giving me more hours. i could never get more than 20 hours a week even with open availability.
bad,Home Depot hires temps who are not vested in their position. Lazy co workers shirk duties and often full time workers pick up slack. Management team is lazy too.
bad,I learned how to use different machines and was able to gain experience in the materials /lumber department as well. I would not go back to working there because the pay is not suffient enough
bad,"dont do it. unless you are a salaried manager, or hove been with the company for over 20 years you will never make any money here. they love the term, ""it"" rolls down hill."
bad,"here is very clicky. Managers have their favorites and make it known, even so much as attempting to fire you for things you are not actually doing wrong."
bad,worked cashier and freight. Climbing corporate scale is difficult and not ideal. Job is much like any other retail job. I rate it as an average place to work
bad,"Good company for the short term. Not somewhere to stick around long term. A big problem that this company has is with it's scheduling, expect to see multiple departments run by 1 person. This is a frustration for both the customer and other staff members alike."
bad,An average day for me would be running around the store picking orders for people to pick up in store. I also picked and prepped deliveries for the next day.
bad,"Fun job, nice and friendly coworkers most of the time. Fair for the most part. Good company to work for if looking a career job or to move up. Nice people."
bad,"I worked here for about a year in multiple positions. I was always on time, never called out, did my work and did it well, helped where I could, and I was one of 2 people with equipment training on the entire day crew. and I get fired? Not layed off fired? All I ever got here was managers talking down to me, disrespectful associates, and a 40 cent raise even with equipment training. No reason to lie about it I got fired for taking a monster. Oh but it was for a freight party and I forgot to make it for store use. If you need the experience go for it but other than that this company has been going downhill since corporate took over."
bad,Home Depot is a descent company but don't invest in the people they work with and work well for them. They prefer to look past all the great things and focus on what errors you have.
bad,"Company loves to run on a skeleton crew leaving customers frustrated not having enough assistance. Random departments will have no staff scheduled "
bad,all around good company and had alot of benefits towards my future and me becoming a more harder worker and i would work for the place if i elavated and became and better person
bad,The Home Depot is a good place to work if you are ready to work hard. Most of the jobs inside of The Home Depot are fairly fast paced and product knowledge is key. They do a very good job of training their associates.
bad,"Working at the Home Depot was more like being in High School, a lot of unnecessary drama and very little substantive work done by those that set about the drama."
bad,The supervisors are all young and walk around doing nothing. They treat you better on who you know. The only time you see them do something is when the manager or District Manager is around. They are in the position because they started working there when they were 16. The pay is horrible. You start at $11 a hour and expect you to work your butt off. A lot of cut throats.
bad,"too much favoritism, that's the only way to climb the ladder is by sucking up. great coworkers though, very friendly. they also have alot of events in store."
bad,"No room for advancement, worked there for two years and got passed up multiple times by people that were a lot less qualified than myself. good luck. One plus is that you can get away with murder and still have your job there. Wasn't literal"
bad,"My day started on the road, always on the road. Leads can be in 200 mile radius. Was very challenging and slow paced situations, not much learned her. Scheduling was interesting to say the least, I could be in the Bronx NY, at 10 am and have to be in Newburgh at 2pm with a consult sit being 2-3 hours. Willing to do anything for the company but, hands were tied. going home was my favorite part of the day,,"
bad,"Home depot work life is very demanding and very fast paced,  constant work with little praise and below average pay. Home Depot is a sub-par company to work for unless then you're a manager, pays up to 20x more than the average associate. My average day consisted of loading up to 200lb of merchandise ( with help) into customers vehicles. Day to day pack down of freight, unloading and loading trucks, overhead management, shelf stocking, etc. Management would give me orders that were my direct responsibility, and jobs that weren't my responsibility. Hardest part was always new management, 4 different supervisors, 2 different District managers, 2 different store managers. Nothing was easy going when it came to management at the Warner Robins Home Depot. The most enjoyable part is making other people's day by always lending a helping hand when needed."
bad,"This is a pretty OK place to work, only downside is the pay is lower than average. Most people enjoy their job there, but need to be paid more. The average worker here is generally retired, stuck in the retail life, or there for seasonal work. Almost no one is happy with how little we are paid, even department supervisors aren't paid enough. The benefits are great, the people are wonderful, and the management does everything they can for you. Corporate greed getting in the way of a well run store."
bad,"If you're a specialist, they've become quite rigid about meeting sales quotas. You make your quotas consistently or you'll be gone. Of course, there is little to nothing a specialist can do to affect customer traffic, but that doesn't matter; you must produce sales out of thin air if there are no customers or expect your job to be temporary. The new focus on in-home sales presentations is especially troubling with Home Depot now taking a Sears approach to one-call closes and high-pressure sales ""consultations"". The prices being quoted to homeowners are obscenely inflated, discounts are pulled from thin air in every presentation to try to close TODAY, and by that department's own admission, they have a closing rate under 20%. And the 4 of 5 who do not close end up turned off the Home Depot. It's the old sales model from the movie, ""Tin Men"" and more consumers hate this sales strategy than appreciate it."
bad,"Home Depot commoditizes the design process by separating the components of the kitchen and bath into separate departments.  Whether good or bad, that's just how they do it."
bad,"Resposible,serious,be on time ,have a good actitud , be friendly with customers  is good experience working in there  be on time when you have to work ."
bad,This job can be very tedious. If you are a company person this is the perfect job. It is very flexible and there are lots of advantages to take care of if you know how to utilize them.
bad,"Many employees treated the environment as a place to gossip, work would not get done and customers would not get helped due to the lack of attention paid to anyone besides their little clique."
bad,The stressfulness of this job played a major part in my quitting. The hours were inconsistent to say the least. They gave you a hard time for the most ridiculous reasons.
bad,"I arrived with extra qualifications from the trades and construction knowledge. I was welcomed with opened arms and helped train lots of staff while I was there. I Had plenty of great coworkers and the job provided excellent benefits"
bad,"Home Depot may not be the place for you to work. The staff is underpaid, the workers are lazy, and the management just wants to go home without having to do anything. Their communication and collaboration skills are severely lacking."
bad,ok good great love it had a freat tim love it work was good did a lot pay was ok learned a lot happy i left les hours more hired managers was ok school was ok
bad,"My job was to return any carts from outside of the store, help customers load and unload their cars and clean up any trash around the store. The hardest part of the job was finding work to do once i was out of work."
bad,"Enjoyed working in customer service and completing office task. Loved my customers, and the helping them with their needs. The store I was at changed management many times and it changed the dynamics and the atmosphere of the work place."
bad,"All employees are treated differently, there are no set standards that are upheld.  The hours vary due to the retail setting, however there is favoritism."
bad,"For the kind of work that was involved, I think the pay was horrible. And annual raises are insulting. Ten to twenty cents - if anything at all. Having to work different shifts, half shifts or split shifts, or only being allowed to work a limited amount of hours is a lot to expect from their employees."
bad,"Great company, as long as you land with the right  running the place. Awesome benefits, and space for growth within the company, on or behind the scene.."
bad,I left because when I went on mat leave the HR manager neglected to file any of the proper paperwork they needed to so that I could get my benefits. Only when we got the labor board involved did we get action.
bad,"Freight coordinator, inventory  management, warehouse documentations, production analyst, logistics and distributions unit in other to meet company objectives."
bad,If fast food is not not something you want to do then the home depot company is perfect. Fast pace and full of problem solving whether with a customer or store setup.
bad,Night crew was always stuck with minimum employees in departments. If you make the effort of learning multiple departments you basically jump from one department to another on a daily basis and then get yelled at for it.
bad,i  work here cause i need money for college. so far i learned to work professionally and work under pressure. hardest part of this job is that theirs no team work anywhere. most enjoyable part is hanging with my associates. workplace is not very organized and poorly managed
bad,"Freight team is poorly overlooked, pay is horrible and raises are a joke the moral there is horrible, it's pretty much clock and clock out you get zero sense of accomplishment, to summarize under staffed, poorly paid, over worked."
bad,"Training consisted of computer based videos and then they threw you to the wolves with no shadowing. The more work you do, the less you got recognized, unless you were in the managers clique that stays in the training room and never comes to the sales floor unless you beg them."
bad,I assisted customer with find merchandise in the store. Unloaded trucks and stocked inventory. I enjoyed working there but at the time i felt I was under paid for the work I was doing and learning. The job was very under staff at the time I was working there. And the training was like a teach yourself type of training.
bad,"I hope other stores management are not like mine. At least I learn not what to do. The company itself is an awesome company to work for as far as benefits, incentives etc."
bad,Staff is very limited and there is rarely proper coverage for the different areas of the store. when associates call out no additional staff is called in to fill in for the spot. the pay for the work that is required is horrible.
bad,this employment needs a union. they can fire yoy with no infraction on your recoed. they offer little pay with plenty of work to do. the management is lovely but they stay over budget where they cut out hours alot
bad,It was a nice & friendly place for work but  that was not a  professional place for  work. Multicultural environment and positive people. Good experience but not great!
bad,Great people to work with but store is poorly managed and pay and ability to grow is limited. Fairly easy work but short on staff and limited in direction.
bad,"Everyone I worked with was friendly. The Home Depot seems to hire nice people, and if anyone isn't friendly, they won't be around for long unless they make a change. In fact, I had a manager who was perfectly competent and capable in his job, but was often condescending to anyone below his rank, and he was terminated for that reason. "
bad,"The people you work make the job. Good managers and bad managers, it's retail so you have to take the good and the bad some days. It a decent place to start out from."
bad,"frequently interrupted breaks and lunchtimes"
bad,"The job itself was relatively enjoyable, lots of varied tasks and a chance to practice problem solving, but the management of the store was horrific. Often impossible to get a hold of, management would let customer issues escalate until they become colossal disasters and leave them for their employees to try and clean up."
bad,Unloading and loading trailers picked product drove a sit down fork lift cherry picker and a reach truck plus a pallet jack packed boxes to get ready to ship.
bad,"Worked there for many years and still make poverty wages.  They do provide food in the break room for the employees that cant afford it, which is nice. To be fair the management is really good to work with but they expect too much. Great job overall."
bad,Basically is only a seasonal oriented operation.  The full time employees control the scheduling.  Not a good environment for people in diverse background.  Management not often effective
bad,"Supervising employees, maintain a safe and friendly work environment for employees. Inventory control, meal preparation, handle money transactions for every shift"
bad,"The associates are what really make the store successful. If the associates feel appreciated and respected, they will in turn give their best efforts on the job. If management is not fully behind the associates, the morale goes down quickly. Communication is HUGE! If upper management doesn't communicate with associates, they will feel left out, and disrespected. If the associates are happy, they will provide excellent customer service, and will complete tasks willingly."
bad,"I won't even shop at home depot because of how they treated me as an employee. I loved the job, unloading trucks and stocking shelves. I learned alot of valuable job experience there but I was eventually laid off because of poor management. Unless you're friends with someone higher up, you're expendable. Pay is horrible."
bad,The first few years of working at the home depot were good. Then management changed and depending on who you worked with the job was pleasant or unbearable.  I learned a lot working at the home depot especially how to deal and handle working with different types of people and personalities.
bad,loved working there overall. team mates were really cool and knowledgable. Management at the particular store was horrible didnt care about their employees.
bad,came to work in decent mood other employees moral could have been better. Hardest part of the job was keeping positive while others were not. enjoyable part of the job was learning all the skills I learned.
bad,I love working outside in the garden center working with customers and making sales and making returns back to the store and online orders making customers happy.
bad,Management doesnt know how to handle specific personal issues with employees. I was being sexually harrassed by other employees and after telling management nothing was ever done.
bad,Very nice place.Good benefits! I love to unload trucks that some thing I thought I could never do. They train you well and treat you like family.
bad,Pushed carts and helped people load their cars. They did not give me any room to advance. Overall did not really enjoy my time there.
bad,Home Depot does not staff its stores with enough employees to meet customer's needs. Makes for unhappy patrons and a frustrating work environment.____
bad,"If it had not been for the fact that I was hired in another town and moved, I would have been out of work within a few weeks. In order to do a store transfer, I had to be put on Permanent status."
bad,not a good place to work.training is horrible.managers need experience and good work ethics. use to be a great palce to work of what I heard the previus employers. I was always miserable there.
bad,"Home Depot can widen a persons knowledge in fixing, building or remodeling homes. Can give a better understanding on how some things work within the home."
bad,Management played favorites and saw any feedback about any changes as disrespectful and subject to being disciplined. Career advancement was almost completely impossible due to management unfair treatment of everyone
bad,i liked home depot because i learned a lot and i got to do different jobs and obtain various skills. i would work for them again
bad,worked as a lot assosicated and assisted customber with purchaces. cash handel and sales advice. enjoyed customer interaction
bad,The work was hard and reward was small.. people get advancement for looks not performance..management pawns work off on supervisors within return is passed on to regular employees
bad,"The most enjoyable aspect of this job is the people you come across and get to speak with. Poor management, good benefits, poor communication from management. Lack of staff to cover the store."
bad,"I loved working there, the people were great. The management was good but we didn't have a store manager for a while. The money was not bad, but i left and then came back the next summer and they tired to lower  my pay. I got the hours i wanted and i had opportunities to move up."
bad,While I worked there my daughter unfortunately ended up very sick she ended up in hospital for 3 days she was so sick and they fired me even though I had doctors notes and pictures of my daughter in the ER looking absolutely miserable. Never work there if you have kids.
bad,i really dont have any thing to say about home depot they dont pay good and work you really hard ...... and some times cut your hours
bad,Great people to work with. Not enough bodies on the floor and little room for advancement. They do have great Christmas parties but no employee discounts.
bad,Home Depot very short-handed does not keep enough people on the floor to help customers product line Give It a 6 on a scale to one to ten. Not really customer oriented
bad,You cannot use your initiative in this organization. Daily task is dependent on the HQ needs for the day. Wasted man-hours due to no direction from supervisors.
bad,Great place to meet people in different walks of life willing to share their knowledge. Enjoyable place to interact with people on a daily basis. Fairly easy to move up.
bad,"the home depot in Sunnyvale, CA was somewhat good and somewhat bad. The employees were nice, but the managers were terrible"
bad,"company to clicky, needs better upper management. too much micro managing, managers always in your business.written up for the smallest things"
bad,its a good job to have but im looking for a job with weekends off and a good schedule. the hours i work arent the greatest either
bad,"Comfortable work environment. Must be willing to work shifts.  Weekend work is required.  Must be willing and able to deal with vendors, stores, contractors and customers."
bad,after working for Home Depot I learned that the management team does not care about the employees but them self's. they don't listen to their employees and are constantly trying to blame them for there not be to get any thing done. they don't want to hire and they work on a very low staff
bad,"Typical in store sales position. Small bonuses are awarded if more sales are made. Typical work day includes helping customers, stocking merchandise, ordering more merchandise, and working on store appearance."
bad,"A typical day at work for my position at the Home Depot is not usually very stressful. I punch in and walk to the receiving area at the back of the store. There is usually a truck waiting to get key rec'd and unloaded, along with RTVs to process and freight to distributed unto carts. I receive and inspect store merchandise along with customer orders to ensure customers receive the best service possible. The best part of my day is making a change whether it is helping a customer or associate to finding a more efficient way to complete daily tasks. The hardest part of the day is working in the receiving area with no air conditioning during the summer, it can become quite hot and humid."
bad,"It comes down to stores and territory.  Mgt.  Will tell you different. If your lucky enough to have a good store(s) with good diligent store mgr. and associates you can make 100k+.  I did. if you get bad stores with bad store associates, your gonna struggle.  You will have to go to store and be an unpaid slave groveling to people who want shovels, salt and light bulbs.  The bad news is all the good stores and territories are taken so you will likely end up in the armpit of the world. It will be your hardwork and persistence (no guarantees) that will determine whether you will be able to make a living."
bad,"Customer service I would help people around me , monitoring what is around us and out side us , supervising everything that was going."
bad,"employees standing around, management hiding in the office, nobody has forklift or lift truck licenses, and excuses abound why they cant give you hours"
bad,Many opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The location I worked in had many emotionally challenged people resulting in about half of the workforce being difficult to work with. I do not recommend this company.
bad,"It's Home Depot, you come to work and you go home. Management enjoys changing the rules on a whim and attendance is a joke. Make sure you watch who are your friends or enemies because people will backstabb you in flash."
bad,Home depot is a very stressful job. its more control by supervisors that don't have any respect for their co-workers. The most enjoyable part about home depot is clocking out to go home.
bad,Management here was probably one of the worst that I have dealt with. Constantly giving its employees snow jobs and not being supportive of the employees decision when taking care of the customers.
bad,stable place to work at but the work environment can be very stressful. Have worked here for about 8 years and the pay raises and  position advancement is very minimal. Management can get very hectic
bad,"Working at The Home Depot in Langford was not the greatest work experience. There is little to no communication, almost no hands on training, little time for online training, and lies all around. There were some great people to work with while some were not the most welcoming."
bad,hours were constantly changing and I had difficulty making a living on the hours changing constantly. I was good at relating to people on the sales floor and giving them the amount of details which would close the sale of appliances.
bad,I loved working for the home depot. What I didn't like was the training they provided everybody. It seemed like nobody was on the same page and everybody was using different process and systems which led to and caused problems. Great company good people poor training.
bad,"Working for a large corporation such as Home Depot has it's good and bad points. They help a lot of people in need which is a positive point. This job puts me in danger on a regular basis when I climb ladders and move boxes in the overstock areas. Finding product in this store is a huge road block since the overstock is not in the right area most of the time. Being a mother of two, I need to find a job that is more safe and doesn't stress me out as much."
bad,Home depot is a very steady place to work and learn many basic skills off of training in different departments. Co-workers work together as a team along with management that runs the store.
bad,As a cashier we had no help and our hours where cut all the time. The store manager would not give us help and would not let us have more then 3 to 4 of us clocked on at once. So because of that customers would get upset at the lines to check out and the wait time to fix a problem they have with an item.
bad,"The management was terrible at the store I worked at. Policies and procedures were constantly not being followed by managers, which made it very difficult for employees to do their job properly."
bad,"This would be a great company if management didn't get transferred from store to store. I had a problem with my store manager, and I was basically told that there was not much that could be done. Everyone had a problem with her, but I believe that she had something on someone!! Therefore, she could not be touched!! Critical of work done, but unable to offer or even consider alternatives!!  You will work your butt off, but that I don't mind, but if you happen to get injured, you will be shamed for going to a doctor!! Many long term employees had to transfer to area stores just to get away from her, yet she continued to treat everyone with disrespect. (at times, even in front of customers) Fellow employees tried to convince me to stay because eventually she would be transferred to another store, but my health was being affected!! Spoke to district manager regarding her (as did other employees) and nothing was ever done. The store was making sales plan and that is all that they cared about. It had nothing to do with her, it had everything to do with the associates."
bad,"I have worked here for a year and have achieved many accolades; however, when one negative remark is given, associates are either dismissed or put on probation."
bad,"Manual loading and unloading of stock, including lumber, soil, concrete, plumbing supplies,"
bad,"I understand everyone is going to train you differently but this company in this specific location doesn't train every well. As a cashier if 4 people were in my line I was automatically kicked off the register so the ""pros"" can handle the public while I sat back and watched. Another thing I didn't appreciate is when I mess up and there's a customer in front of me instead of waiting until there wasn't anyone in my line they would stop what I was doing in order to explain and help with what I did while the customer was standing right there waiting and the line grew longer."
bad,"My co-workers do not receive the appropriate or sufficient amount of training. We are usually understaffed, at times which could ne stressful."
bad,"Provide customer service, including directing customers to products, answering questions about goods, and assisting with home improvement plan in purchase decisions. Perform stocking organizing, and cleaning duties at the request of the management team. Work closely with managers to deliver satisfaction to every customer entering the store."
bad,Boss always turned to me to do the work because he knew I would get it done but never managed others to make them accountable for their own workload.
bad,"it is hard on your back and feet.  you go home very tired at the end of your shift.  you never work the same time or day each week, so you have to be very flexible."
bad,"Seems like the only people who get positive attention are the ones who are popular or liked. they are not too realistic when it comes to working with another schedule, (i.e. another job, school, etc)"
bad,"Being parttime, I wasn't getting enough hours but the guys worked with were pretty cool. The cool part of the job was able to joke around to make the night go by faster."
bad,Leading a team to execute different projects and task through out the day maintaining the readiness and cleanliness of the store.
bad,a bunch of monkeys could have run the store better the management blows i was at 208 the only thing that was good where the dhs and the associates thats it
bad,"Can make a lot of money, not much support from upper management.  Have to self generate leads in the stores.  "
bad,"HR Support for store and field."
bad,"great place to work, only doesn't pay enough to live. and all the young people fight to get full time. management uses full-time employment to hang over them."
bad,Work sufficiently and diligently to receive my pay and leave. I've learned to provide excellent customer service day in an out. The hardest part of the job is advancing within the company due to favoritism with management. The most enjoyable part is building a relationship with customers so that they'll become a lifetime shopper at Home Depot.
bad,"As with all companies you have to deal with working with good people and the a-holes.  The hours really slack off in the winter so working part time cashier you mite not even get 20 hours for the week. Overall don't mind the job, it's the pressure from management for the cashiers to get customers to sign up for the Home Depot credit cards that I hate.  They don't mention this part in the job interview as a job requirement which is deceitful."
bad,"Was my first job out of high school. The coworkers were fun to work with. Unless your friends with management, their is no opportunity for advancement. Would rather hire new inexperienced people, than promote from within."
bad,Help customers and also would help my coworkers in succeeding to getting the things that they need.
bad,"home depot is a great place far as the people the hours suck and the pay is not great at all.you,ll definititly need a second job to survive"
bad,It varies by department but my department is a very fast paced place to work with a great deal of data extraction. Not enough time for analysis. I feel like I am back in high school with all of these clicks.
bad,it could be a great work place if there were more team work and comunication of associates
bad,"I mainly verified client information and set payment plans according to contract that was signed. Also, managed payments via phone."
bad,No room to really grow and expand from your current position. No real team work was ever displayed. I would not work at another again if I could help it.
bad,Being a cashier was not the job for me. I did not like standing there for my entire shift and not being able to go do anything to help around the store.
bad,Home Depot has a good culture of people working together and helping each other out.  A typical day at work begins for me at 9:00 pm.  I use industrial equipment to unload merchandise from vendors and store the products throughout the store.  Management is cooperative in accomplishing my tasks.  Working overnights was the most difficult part of this job.  Most enjoyable was relationship with co-workers and cooperating with the team.
bad,they teach you everything you need to know of home depot and a good place to shop
bad,"I liked how fast paced this job was, but was very overworked and underpaid. Company did not believe in raises. I managed 3 employees and the convenience store and still made almost minimum wage. All in all i liked the position just not the company."
bad,I performed basic cashier duties. I assisted customers with basic questions about items that we sold.
bad,"Gather in a group discussion regarding the day before quality & speed."
bad,Enjoyed the management and workers and the overall helping of customers
bad,Overall good hardworking co-workers but the way company treats workers could be improved.
bad,Total freedom no strict daily routine to adhere to. Stress free
bad,I was a key cutter at home depot so basically I would stand at my assigned post for my entire shift minus the lunch break. The company is great but the location i was located has poor management and doesn't work with you on scheduling your days of work .
bad,typical day was gathering carts and loading merchandise into peoples cars
bad,I really enjoyed working for Home Depot. I was given many opportunities to be  in leadership positions. There was a high team environment.
bad,Company is very large and did not recognize individual efforts that contributed to the teams success
bad,Lots of hard work and not enough pay. I am so glad to be done with that and on to bigger and better things
bad,"The people I work with are/ were great and the job itself was pretty easy. Most of the days are the same. It involves loading product into customer's cars, cutting wood, helping customers, rearranging product and changing counts of the product."
bad,I dont receive enough hours even though I went to all manangers and told them that I cannot afford to have this job if I'm only getting 9 hours a week cause it costing me more to come here. They not very understanding and sometime I feel like they purposely do this. Just very unhappy right now
bad,Not a great place to work there is not enough breaks 10hours you get 2 but now that they are doing 8 they only get 1break
bad,"Enjoyed the experience since i ahve been with the company, but I'm currently looking for a full time posotion"
bad,"The Home Depot company overall is associate friendly....however, when it comes to management the expectations are un realistic to complete the job how it is outlined."
bad,I would help customers that came into the store to find merchandise and ring them up at a cash register.
bad,it was good  alright pay good  hours   busy good ppl  and work envirment
bad,"clean empty apartments and get them ready for new tenants"
bad,"It's a great place to work for there are great people to interact with the customers are awesome and mixing paint was also fun to do. Some of the co-associates were very difficult to work with, but I managed"
bad,I work in a call center where I answer calls and troubleshoot them appopriately.
bad,"Making sure is opeaning ready , also making sure every customer servcie, and but not lease a team player"
bad,"Supervising cashiers and other associates, completing paperwork, providing excellent customer service."
bad,Great people to work for. Loved the garden section.Fun job.
bad,"100% commission, with no idea of the next days schedule until 10:15 PM the night before. No gas reimbursement."
bad,"During Halloween it was a fun place to be for which your day never went by slow because you always had to be on the go helping customers and making sure the store looked clean for the other customers to find the things they needed. My other staff some of which was a little weird i did not like the fact that i had one keep bothering me and my ""space"". My manager was lost half of the time he really didn't know what he was doing."
bad,"Okay job, best part is the smell of the lumbar yard. Management was usually pretty dumb, perks are almost nonexistent to lower levels, good luck becoming anything higher than a section head. Company has an odd scheduling procedure now, goes to a centralized location for all stores. Not created onsite. You will quickly become a knowledgeable Handyman."
bad,Its ok to work there . its a lot of work and can at times be hardsips but overall its ok.
bad,had a lot of fun traveling and using different office equipment
bad,Working at Home Depot has enabled me to have exceptional customer service and dependability
bad,"Can be a job for growth, lack of communication among management."
bad,I enjoy learning about construction and helping customers complete their projects.
bad,"Fairly easy and made a little extra spending money. Really liked the people who worked there, and enjoyed learning about all the materials."
bad,"Home Depot offers a flexible schedule suitable for students, homemakers, part timers."
bad,"I can't a lot about this job because it has been some time. But I do remember that overtime was like a bad word. If you stayed past your scheduled time one day the next day that you worked, that would have you leave early to prevent overtime. My management was very caring and allowed flexibility when it came to the schedule, except for overtime. Co-workers were fun, the hardest part of the job was when you had to give customers bad news, i.e., the itemed you ordered has been discontinued, or it won't ship for another four months. The enjoyable part of the job was it paid the bills and after a while you establish a rapport with the frequent customers."
bad,you start off at the bottom and work your way up but overall its a cool place to work
bad,"It was a slow store but when the summer time hit, it became a little be overwhelming at times."
bad,no job security even though indivivual may have or be given glowing reports.no complaints as to management co-workers or work itself. no security as far as hours provided. overall rating two stars.
bad,I didn't work here very long and they did not pay well. They were not very flexible when they gave you hours.
bad,The Home depot seemed like a good company to work for until I realized that the hours were very limited. It would be ideal for someone looking for a second job.
bad,"It was an awful place to work, never had enough computers for all the workers, they were always getting stuck."
bad,I worked in the Garden Department at Home Depot and I typically did a lot of customer service and I also did a lot of restocking. I was responsible for explaing products to customers and also keeping the Garden Department clean and in order. The job was very physically taxing but I enjoyed my co-workers very much.
bad,"Not a big fan of this company. They always over-scheduled me when I was going to school. I told them I could only work 20 hours a week, but they regularly scheduled me to work 30! Will not go back - they don't care at all about personal development."
bad,"I fronted and faced, made keys, did extensive customer service, pushed credit cards, took returns, stocked inventory. The hardest part of the job was the varied hours which were'nt enough and poor management. I enjoyed working with tools and helping customers."
bad,"very well balanced and good variety of culture. I learned a lot about their products, the management was sub par. the co workers were minimally interested. Every part was hard. I was a lot tech and pretty much was used as the stores' personal slave. the most enjoyable part was clocking out."
bad,"Job was ok, The bosses never have your back. I stayed on a fork lift all day long."
bad,I would recommend this company to anybody interested in retail.
bad,"Work with clents and restock shelves. Some managers are very nasty, no help from top manager."
bad,Home Depot is your typical large retail department store job. It is no job that I would seek to work in permanently or expect an long term growth from.
bad,Management has gone downhill. The Home Depot used to care about their employees. Not anymore. More concerned with shift coverage than the actually employees.
bad,I worked at Home Depot for a little bit over 5 years and I moved from position to position and felt like I wasn't appreciated for the work that I did.
bad,"It was early morning hours. The job requirement were to clean bays restock product, and rearrange bay material that expired. Also we were sub contracted to work through home depot store venues"
bad,"Home Depot wasn't the best job I have experienced, because of the warehouse feel and lack of management. The pay wasn't awful but I still wound't recommend."
bad,"I started off as a lot attend so I had to get buggy out the lot and help load customer and I learned how to drive a forklift, reach truck,  and a Ballymore and the work place was a fast pace environment you had to learn quick and move quick"
bad,"2x a year, you will get a bonus (Success Sharing), it entirely depends on your store's sales."
bad,Management were unsociable to the Associates. Only the management enjoy the benefit most. Management choose to ignore the Associates and never recognized me as a Veteran. They only concentrate on the Management.
bad,They looked at me like i was not supposed to be there. I could feel the discomfort i would bring into a room just with my presence. Yet again racism i do my job and at a fast rate too and i wont take break i dont have to take but yet i still botherd them.
bad,It was a good experience for me and I like the people that are there but I have seen so many people come and go because of the physical work that they want you to do the mental work that they want you to do and the loops and ropes they want you to go through incline it's not worth the pay
bad,"The pay was low for such a huge company, but really good management and work culture. The management team was very helpful and open to new ideas to better the store."
bad,"Muy buen ambiente y facilidades para el desarrollo pero a la hora de renuncia busacan la maera de perjudicarte de la manera mas horrible y al instante te bloquean las tarjetas es mejor que saques todo el dinero antes de renunciar y hacerlo al instante,siempre ge dicen que ese dia no pueden te citan una semana despues para quitarte le mayor cantidad posible en finiquito"
bad,"I was bullied at my job by a lot of my superiors, and deemed it as ""just playing"". I was treated as a child and a lot of work day requests/changes were limited to none. Gossip was spread around the store and I was harassed constantly. Not to mention they tried calling you on your break when you still had time. Management was alright, employees were sub-par. They had rats and roaches in the break room. There was also a dress code, no visible piercings, but visible tattoos are okay? That's a juxtaposition to them wanting to be professional. I have piercings and tattoos everywhere, and they want me to flip my nose ring back in while I have a full sleeve of tattoos. Also you cant wear a hat backwards, you cant wear a sweater over your apron, no holes in the jeans, no tank tops, no shorts, no dresses. Literally a suit and tie place and its horrible considering its in Manhattan, the heart of self-expression."
bad,"Lots of customer's never enough help, and depending on the store/location overtime was hardly ever an option. Co-workers are great and willing to help in the time of need."
bad,"Working at the Home Depot can be a great place to work, but at moments they are management that makes it really hard. They value the customers trust over their own employees. Its an overall great environment to be in but poor management skills."
bad,"There was a lack of training of new employees by managers."
bad,i am in charge of cleanup of junk skids into recycle trailer plus receive stock trailers and courier deliveries. i run daily RGR and DGR reports to check and see if there were any purchase order issues.
bad,work hard and long hours to become something. you have to get a feeling for giving up a social life in order to get ahead at home depot. great benefits comes at a cost
bad,been here a while and just need better to support my lifestyle and my family ..been here six plus years and I can do almost anything and I just don't make enough money.
bad,Home Depot is a great company to work for if the management is good. The company tries to take care of you. Good benefits. Management at tehachapi location management does not take care of their associates
bad,"Home Depot was the dream fun job to have to be outside watering the plants and interacting with the customers, they told me I was hired part time but what it turns out is that I was hired on for seasonal and I was let go after the season was over. After they told me I was hired on for seasonal I just stuck with it and hope for the best and see if they wanted to hire me on for part time. The only really bad thing about it was when I was outside to help load there was no one else to help me get the big heavy bags of mulch!!! Or when I was getting someone hay or pine straw and there would be a line of cars and no one would come help, a customer was so nice enough to go get someone to help me get the pine straw. That job was nice but I say the company is really bad to work for!!! If you want to work at Home Depot make sure they are hiring for physical part time not seasonal, because I was left without a job for three whole months with the help of the unemployment  department. Home Depot is a nice place to shop but a bad place to work!"
bad,"I was  an exterior sales and paid straight commission. They never paid for my gasoline, driving over 30,000 miles a year, didn't pay for meetings and expected me to work in the store for free. When I gave my 3-4 week notice for resigning, I was terminated after a week. Many of my remaining commissions and bonus were not paid as they only pay 2 weeks after your last day, resulting in over $5,000 of lost wages."
bad,"Discrimination, judgmental, Don't care about your life and what you have going on in your life. High turn over. Treat employees incredibly horrible..."
bad,The compensation is not where it needs to be. Merchandising Execution Associates are under paid for the amount of work and responsibility that we have.
bad,"The amount of money I receive here is terrible.  I understood I was accepting a part time job, not a ""no time"" job.  They have taken my miniscule amount of hours and lowered them."
bad,I worked the graveyard stocking shift. It was tough work and long nights but for a just out of  high school job it was fine. But you didn't get much down time.
bad,A good first job to people who dont have kids and just wabt to make some extra money. The management doesnt care about you they just want to make their sales.
bad,Company pays well and has great benefits. Good values however unfair treatment of many employees. Management favors people often and pushes employees by threatening jobs .
bad,"This a good place for older people to stay away from tv or thinking hard at home,when it come to hours its a terrible place to work because they make the schedule complicated"
bad,I really enjoyed working for this company. However due to the fact i was in school and they required me to work a certain amount of hours i was left stranded and forced to leave
bad,"Decent pay for Elko, easy work. I really enjoy working there but the poor raises, the clueless management make it very difficult to move anywhere in the company. Its give or take, great company, great benefits, ran in the wrong way."
bad,I was just there so I didn't get fired. there was nothing special that stood out to me. you  stood on your feet all day. they gave you full time hours but kept you as a part time employees.
bad,Home depot is a friendly environment but not a place to work for a living there pay makes u work like a slave and customer service is not professional;
bad,"El salario era muy bueno era 1200 semanal mas horas extras, me gusto por el salario hasta que se termino la obra."
bad,"Benefits are great, pay not too good, had a set schedule, which it was Monday thru Friday, no weekends or holiday.  As a MET associate, I had the pleasure of learning how to assemble displays for major holidays, re-setting of bays, organizing and overall helping customers with their needs."
bad,Awesome place to work!!!! Employees click up. No chance to advance to full time unless you brown nose some one. I loved the benefits they offer. Management is ok.
bad,"Typical day at work is starting at 5am. Lots of walking, down stocking, and ladder climbing. The store is HUGE, its the super store after all, so everything is 10x's more harder than in a normal home depot."
bad,fast pace good money i liked want i was doing i leard how to operate the folklift i work overnight unloading freight the hardest part of the job was deaking with some of your co workers
bad,This company is a good foundation if your trying to get into law. you work with a team of attorneys. it was very  boring with no windows in my office. The manager I had was rude but all the attorneys were nice.
bad,"Home Depot was nice for the first few months.  They make it seem like theres so many opportunities with the company and plenty of incentives.  Moving up is rather difficult, its like a donkey having a carrot dangled in front of it and those incentives just suck off what little money they pay you.  Management is usually clueless to what is going on or how to do anything."
bad,flexible shifts. no advancement within the company. horrible pay. work is pretty suitable for anyone to do. pay raises are horrible.
bad,Home depot is a great place to work there's always room for advancement. It wasn't the spot for me because of the dust everywhere.
bad,"Learned customer service while working at a fast cluttered space, short staffed and under managed. management should be taught to sometimes back associates and not humiliate to please customer"
bad,Management could've been a little better. Good place to work. Had fun for the most part. Sometimes understanding. They give you the tools you need to grow. Advancement was always optional
bad,"The Home Depot was a fun place to work and the benefits were great. The co-workers were very nice individuals, however management made the whole experience less enjoyable. Managers are under a lot of pressure and they take their frustration out on employees.  It was a good experience because I interacted with numerous customers who are great individuals and made my workday more enjoyable."
bad,"busy..."
bad,"My experience as an employee at home depot hasn't been the best. I understand that management has to enforce the policies and the rules of the company, but me and along with the other employees feel we don't get treated the way we are supposed to. My co-workers are nice and friendly people to be around, they are the most enjoyable part of my day, the hardest part I would say is trying to keep customers calm whenever they are unsatisfied with something."
bad,"crowded, i learn about a few home improvement projects and i got to mean fun people"
bad,"Well I worked for Depot for 4 years,I loved my job! But if they do not like you and you do not kiss there b... They will get rid of you.So if you are an b.... kisser apply...mark my word that's how it is,I was not a b.... Kissers,but done my job that's why I am not with this company anymore!!!"
bad,I have two children that I have to see every other weekend. They were not very flexible and able to cater to the needs of my family. The management did not fire me but cut my hours down to nothing. I felt that the way that this was handled was not very professional. They have a constant need for cashiers because they quit so frequently from the lack of uniform management expectations.
bad,"Unless your career has to do w/ the following, "
bad,"Everyone that works there is very nice, friendly and willing to help with any questions you might have. The job isn't bad at all, the store isn't bad as well it's just the new night management is horrible. Let me put it like this, if no one likes you in the day shift and you're rarely seen in the day shift because you're the night manager what does that mean? In other words ever since he came in and started to make changes and call shots everyone started to quit and everyone I know and talk to has bad opinions about him. other than that one horrible night manager the store is great and I wish I worked there longer but as far as that same manager works there it's impossible to work with that person which that's the hardest part of the job is dealing with that person. As far as the most enjoyable part of the job is when the night manager calls out or comes in late and we don't have to deal with his bad faces/comments."
bad,I was concerned being that it’s a predominantly white location and I was one of the few black workers . I bonded with a lot of the older ladies and was treated very nice and often got rewards and pats on the back for doing a good job
bad,"Although there is favoritism at the Florin home Depot it does pay, however keeping to yourself is a silent but known rule because the supervisor will intend using it against you for discrimination."
bad,"I was in garden , but relocated to a new department. The two ladies that work full time out in the garden department are awful. They treat other employees like dirt. They belittle and yell at other employees. It’s absolutely absurd that the management continues to allow such appalling behavior. These two ladies raise their voices at customers on a daily basis. Customers do not want to shop here anymore because of this ongoing hostile atmosphere."
bad,I love working there but when it was time to partner up with never a partner with says two people left I weigh 170 lb I was having to lift boxes weighing over 150 to 200 lbs by myself.. when in the break room the gentleman disrespectful towards the female about other females and I I felt uncomfortable at times I love the work and it got me in shape out of the bunch of people that work there there was only one or two people that were kind to you and respected that you were a female when you show up to work there was nobody greeting you everybody looked angry and upset and as the night would go it would get more chaos it just felt like things weren't getting done and they would like to throw multiple tasks on one person I never mind getting my job done and I appreciate y'all for hiring me right
bad,When I began to work there I received 26 hours one week 15 the next and less than that the third then back up into the teens. The hours will NOT  be flexible only if you are FULL TIME they will be consistent.
bad,Depends on when u get there but management is not well. Some of the managers were understanding and unfortunately some weren't. Depends on where ur in life is how I would recommend
bad,"My home depot experience was very interesting to say the least. Very competitive and very stressful at times when its extremely busy. Also, its a way to advance if you know what you doing."
bad,"The only reason to work at The Home Depot is if you are a retiré, a student, or pretty desperate. To put it simply, you have to put in a ton of hours to make very little money, even if you are full time. This is not a place to work for people that dream of Hawaiian vacations or even being able to upgrade one's  car."
bad,The position was 100% commission and if the construction crew didnt install the product properly it would affect my commission and I would usually not receive one.  I made 200 a week most weeks.
bad,"it a wonderful company to work for, but the store I was in the management was only worried about store appearance and didn't care a whole lot about the employee's.  if you showed up that was all that was needed, didn't treat everyone the same, there was favorites in place where there shouldn't have been."
bad,"In the paint department it was my job to educate customers on products such as interior and exterior paint as well as deck and sealant, i knew much about paint and little about deck preparation and renovation. they had very little patience for my lack of knowledge and never leaded me a hand in gaining or how to gain more experience for deck repair and prep."
bad,I learned alot working for this company helped me to go forward in my career with them.They helped to teach me alot and allowed me to challenge myself I went from part time cashier  to supervisor in less than 5 years
bad,"Job was easy...too much free time on hands. Co workers liked to put themselves in other coworkers personal lifes. Managers where great, shifts went by fast..I enjoyed the time I did spend there but the job was not for me."
bad,"In my experience I enjoyed it at first. Worked diligently I loved working with customers. Then I applied to a transfer to a different department. I'm not here to bash home depot. All I have to say what happened next was unfair. I was given my transfer around the time raises where given. So instead of giving me the floor raise, they gave me the annual raise which was about $2 less. But the next guy received the floor raise."
bad,"Worked in ""Special Services"" dept, served customers in person and on the phone whose orders were incorrect or unavailable. Phoned customers when their orders arrived, recorded daily sales, expidited items for orders and inventory."
bad,Overall is a good starter job. This place has great benefits and a good atmosphere. Loved my co workers all were fun and caring people to work with. Management was unorganized though and there was poor communication and drama between management staff.
bad,I enjoy my job at Home Depot. It is a great place to meet people from different walks of life. I work in the garden department where I enjoy sharing my knowledge of gardening with customers.  the garden associates are like a family.  We have a great manager who is more than willing to assist the associates as well as customers.
bad,"go to work clock in, start grabbing items off silver carts and pallets to stock them if they can't be stocked put them on the floor infront of the shelfs to be put in over stock later. after the store is close put all of the items that couldn't be stocked on the shelfs put them into over stock."
bad,This a great place to work. The enviroment is very laid back and the co workers a good people to work with.
bad,"The Home Depot is regular company where there is not to much to learn, the hardest part of the job is that sometimes you have to do by yourself the 2 or 3 people job, what I love the most from this company are their friendly  associates."
bad,They all were nice to me but they didn't help me at all with my anxiety. they made it worst.i had a hard time with the computers. i learned alot but my anxiety got in the way. co-workers were nice and management were nice. 
bad,"I did not like working at this particular Home Depot because the management was not welcoming. However, the pay and hours given were great."
bad,"Home depot is a nice place to work but the management team don't listen. Supervisor are horrible at this particular warehouse I work at. The point system is awful and pay rate is not good. The supervisor harass the ones who work, You get written up if you talk. When corporate come to the warehouse they to be nice to you. An don't want you speak to the regional manager"
bad,"Working at the Home Depot as a cashier you are used to a fast pace environment, and thats what I loved about it. I learned about the company products and telling our customers what we offered; for example our Home Depot card! I loved meeting new people day in and day out and also loved seeing our regulars come in. The hardest part about being a cashier is standing there for so many hours, and not being allowed to move around."
bad,"They focus mostly on part times to do all the heavy work but they will compensate you with fun parties, free food and heartwarming co-worker. The bad part is that they have a very strick policy and you can get fire if you make a mistake ( even if it was someone else but under your responsibility) the manager at mine store like people who suck his D (figurative) . If you want a heavy work and nice pay with mostly part time this is a job for you."
bad,It’s ok to work at Home Depot. But for the time I have put in and the work I do I don’t get paid enough. I love working here and the people that I work with.
bad,They are a good part time job for school. maybe it was my location. But i didn't like the environment. Sexist with the workers. ( guys do this girls dont. )
bad,"Good team "
bad,HD is great for the young or retired as a part time job. There is room for growth. Not a good fit for parents with school aged kids. They have great benefits if you can get on full time but highly unlikely for so many associates that worked along side me. Its a huge corporation so their associates are numbers. but a good job for those who prefer that kind of environment.
bad,"The workplace culture is great every month the have what they call AOM. On that day they feed everyone that works for the company. Benefits are excellent health medical. They also help with school tuition. A typical day at work would be a beginning stretch. And after that was required to use an RF gun as a gap filler. The job was very physical had to lift more than 40 pounds over your head constantly for the rest of the day.  Sometimes had to drag things that were more than 75 pounds. Great examples that, I had to drag all the time were giant water heaters and toilets. We built a wall with the boxes and had to load more than 1,700 boxes a day. We worked four days a week ten-hour shifts.  We had to climb three steps to lift things above a double stacked pallet. It was a very hard job. And I had high numbers I put in more than I was expected. I am hard worker it didn't matter how great your performance was they would not move me or rotate me. The job is supposed to rotate all the employees to do different things. I was told that they would not put me on a lift after they certified me because my numbers were too high. Exact words were,"" Sorry but we are selfish, and we haven't moved you because your numbers are too high, and we need you there."""
bad,A slow paced businee based off customer service and making sure the customer leaves satisfied.
bad,"Not a bad place to work if you have no personal life. Schedule is brutal. Everyone can and will be scheduled as late as midnight and have to come back as early as four am. They do this with a straight face. "
bad,"Not many hours not really enough money but the job was pretty easy co workers was awsome, management was ok."
bad,The management and the culture are very good.
bad,"The job itself is what you would expect in retail honestly, the only downside is the scheduling and the hours =. even as a temp and others who are part time barely get any hours making it hard to pay bills and have money to get necessities."
bad,"I did enjoy this job because it had benefits, and it wasn't a difficult job to do even though I was always up for a challenge. I think that it was a great job overall ."
bad,"I was fired because the window treatment installer didn’t know we were going all cordless. They no longer come with end mounts, which were needed. The customer was very very upset, so they let me go. I was the go to guy. I also helped cashier, work service desk, put orders together, taught install classes and if slow helped other departments. But I had to leave a place 1 loved to work"
bad,"Se fit seulement à un avis, n'écoute pas énormément leur employés."
bad,Was a good place to work for. Starting off. Right out of high school or in need of a part time job to earn extra cash. But good benefits for the part time associates.
bad,"open to other cultures and walks of life, truly practices equal protection of the Law and non-discrimination. well mannered and tempered environment."
bad,Great place I work with great people and we always good along and put our heads together to take tasks we were suppose to do in partners to help from anyone straining themselves
bad,"The company as a whole is a great company with positive views and is an overall well-intentioned company. They provide job security and rescue after major storms. #3604, the store I happened to work at had unstable management, going through about 5 managers over the course of 2 years. It was hard to communicate with management, as they had a very quick-to-blame attitude. Everything about working for Home Depot was great, this one particular store was hard to work for."
bad,Garden associate job was ok but sometimes got annoying. Home Depot is a different type of store. Most customers that come into a Home Depot are great. I never in the year I was there had a single hostile or nasty customer and I worked across the entire store as a floater so I saw pretty much every single customer that was there at least once every day for my entire employment there. Good place to move up into management very easy to promote. The hiring process is amazing they work so hard to get the right kind of people. They would not hire strange of odd people or unsociable people. Everyone there was nice and helpful.
bad,"I was very disappointed that the company went out of business.  It was a great company with a great compensation package, it just went bankrupt."
bad,It was okay for a person to try to make there way to the top.You can learn a lot of thing on home fixing and the produce. The management was okay but need to help people more to make them feel like a term in that store. co-worker are okay but make feel like it was every men orwomen for them self. But there are some good poeple that are willing to help what i enjoy most are some of the good people they make you feel like family.
bad,"Assisting customers with questions about product. I learned a lot about paint being that was the job I was assigned to. Management was on hand and constantly checking up on their employees. My Co-Workers were friendly and nice to work with. My hardest part of the job was only in the beginning when it came to being familiar with such a big store. After a few weeks it wasn't a problem anymore when becoming more aware of my surrounding, Nothing major."
bad,Was one of my favorite places to work. Worked for this company longer than I have at any other job and could honestly say I'd go back to help at anytime. But need a job with more pay for the rest of my future.
bad,"A day at the Home Depot was never typical. Everyday you learned something new. I learned a lot about home improvement and  customer service. The managers their were sincere and compassionate, they made me feel like part of the family. The associates were helpful and eager to assist you with whatever they could. The hardest part of my job was getting off on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was solving the problem for the customer. I felt as if I made a difference in their shopping experience at Home Depot,."
bad,"This company is perfect, I loved working here, and i still do. Unfortunately, My Manager was put into a role she was not ready for. This lead to a lot of friction when we had to collaborate and go into my day-to-day. With her lack of knowledge of what I do and how I do it, she was unable to provide accurate feedback, and reviewed me on the work she thought I should be doing, not the work I was responsible for."
bad,Had great benefits for employees.  Many opportunities for career advancement . Loved my coworkers.  Learned a lot about hardware.  Many products and development.
bad,"Answering inbound calls and making outbound calls as well. I learned to multi-task on screens. I'm almost sure I improved my typing skills. the management team was ok, and most of my co workers were helpful when I first started. The hardest part of the job was being unable to successfully assist the customer. making sure the customer was happy."
bad,type of work at night. how to get work done as a team. manager was not very nice at all. co-workers were awsome. the lifting. my breaks
bad,The Home Depot is an okay place to work if it’s temporary or your looking to get more knowledge on hardware and lumber materials and merchandise along with home and improvement
bad,"Nice place to work gives you great benefits and secured job. Worked there a long time and if I wanted to, I could retired. The place has sick time and dental and paid holidays. You also can take advantage of their paid vacations. After 5 years, you are able to get 3 weeks of paid vacation."
bad,"A typical day of work consists on working the cash register, working in the garden department, working the returns counter, cleaning and helping customers find what they are looking for. I also, bake cakes to raise money for our "" fun fund"". I tried to give HD a 5 star rating, but my computer wouldn't let me get past the one star."
good,"The staff at Home Depot were amazingly positive. Unfortunately, the hours were not enough or not worth being there. If HomeDepot would offer all staff full time this would be a great place to work"
good,"Low pay hard work. In the MET Team , every minute of you day is tracked . You will work 5- 8 hr days.  Mostly Merchandising. They will want you to get every forklift license . Don't.  You wont get any extra pay. Just more work"
good,False advertisements they do not care about their employees all the managers are rude inconsiderate their way or the highway attitude I did not have transportation I had to catch the city bus I was schedule 7 p.m. to 11p.m. the last bus came by the job at 10:40p.m. I told them that i would not have a ride homehome.home unless I catch the bus can i come in 30 minutes early and leave at 10:30 so il won't have to walk 4 hour's to get home
good,"Work you to the bone and always ask for more, safety hazards everywhere for both customer and employees, dirt and dust creates breathing problems, not enough workers, and the worst part is the pay and low 20 cent raises every 6 months."
good,The customers are the reason I work at Home Depot and location.   My loyalty n great experience have not been rewarded with advancement.  I am a minimalist and really do not have much more to say.
good,"Fellow employees aren't very friendly. Management is not very flexible to the needs to employees with fulltime jobs and are working part time. Decent place to work, but constantly pushing for leads, surveys, and credit applications."
good,However I was referred her through my LVN program to help subsidies the loss of income i had while going to school. It was the worst example of nepotism in a work place.
good,"They are ruled by regulation and policy,  afraid to help or actually care to avoid lawsuits, they drop people like old habits if they think there is any chance it could be something they have to work with you on."
good,putting away returns - cleaning the department - making sure there are no safety issues - stocking shelves - facing shelves and providing customer service
good,Hired some new people right out of high school with no experience at $0.30 less than I make and then they said no raise for you not interested in when somebody doesn't care about me but they want to bust our soul to make sure that we bust our soul to get the job done do a good job keep it clean and start at 6 a.m.
good,The managers that run this company are not great. They do not look out for the best interest of their employees. They pay is not great considering what kind of work and the hours that are going to be put in.
good,"Great crew to work with.The Grants Pass store really knows what customer service is. WAS A HONOR TO WORK WITH YOU.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] Try, to provide the customer with everything the need.And if the don,t have it the will call other comp.to find it."
good,Policies for the employees specifically new employees regarding sick   time and attendance seem unbalanced and unfair. The work hours generally being offered seem unfair as well since they mainly hire for part time and part time associates benefits aren't as good as full time. They also can and will move you around to whatever department needs a employee even if you aren't trained on how the department works.
good,"there is no typical day at work because you never know what they're going to have you do.i was never trained by anyone if learned anything,it was on my own.some of the co works are laid back and nice,but most of them are rude to customers and that reflects on me which i dont like."
good,"It was always a pleasure to re-stock the shelves for the next day, work along side other team members to accomplish the same goal."
good,"a typical day at work involved clocking in, and going to my station (The register). Once there I would sign in and wait for a customer to finish shopping and I would ring them up. I got to learn a lot about the products when customers would bring items to the register with no bar code or sku number, in which case we would call the department and gain a number we could use so we could quickly and efficiently get the customer taken care of. The management definitely did their job, for the most part, granted they cant be everywhere at work, so if for some reason a manager was not available, other associates were more than happy to try and assist with a problem. The hardest part of the job was probably getting loading assistants to the customers that asked. Which was very frequently and customers do tend to be upset after waiting, even if it isn't really that long of a wait. The most enjoyable part of the job, was definitely my co-workers. They made every day there awesome!"
good,"Help out customers with any garden center"
good,"Above statement says it all.  The management was poor.  Typical day at work, management was always breathing down your neck."
good,Was paint expert and garden expert and hardware and kitchen and bath employee no promotion opportunity
good,"terrible hours, unrealistic employee expectations, enjoyed helping customers and other employees, management left a great deal to be desired...highly ineffective, changed regularly, and much more.  I  should have been in charge.  Too much aggravation for the pay."
good,it a grat company if they like you. if they dont they will find away to get rid of you..
good,The company is really a good company to work for and has areas to grow in if you fit the description that they are looking for.
good,"I promptly found another job. They did not take complaints seriously, and tried to brush problems under the rug."
good,"Great people working there, typical corporate management style of squeeze everything you can out of one employee for the least amount of money. Then replace them. In the type of economy that we have now, where jobs are at a premium, I see person after person whose is underemployed working for nothing, and fearing losing their job."
good,"The floor workers, except for a few bad apples are great. They share knowledge, help out as a team, and have your back. However, the reason they do this is because Management seems to always be on the prowl. They wonder why morale is so low (Management 101--get a clue!! This is a leadership issue!!) yet are constantly looking for things done wrong rather than rewarding and appreciating things done right. In addition, the people who do well here seem to have family already working at the company. This is seen with management and even HR and the ""family"" always seems to do well. Plus, lots of conflict of interest going on here with side businesses that compete with the company itself. Associates use their time on the floor to generate leads for themselves. Pretty smart except this is against company policy. Oh wait, the ones doing it know the family members.....Lots of nepotism here. Many people who have worked together for a long time and know how to work the company system. Great for them, not so great for the company and leads again and again down the path of bad morale....self perpetuating problems at this store. Newest manager seems to be great yet apparently inherited all of the above issues. Hard to break those cycles and I doubt they will get fixed until the management team is broken up."
good,i would not care to comment on this com mom allways said if you cant say something nice
good,when I worked here I never had fun never talked to anyone really the workers were negative most the time no opportunities for advancement the pay was bad just to mess up my back
good,Great co workers but horrible managers.   Detached and way too distant.  The management was very protective about those who were trying to advance in the company.
good,"Your expected to take over other Project Managers territories up six or more stores, While upper management  look to fill the position this can take up three or more months. "
good,"Home Depot has many people that have been working there for a long time and therefore cannot handle technology or change and therefore the management is lagging behind in terms of management style and appreciation. Managers have poor people skills and many don't even have skills but are in management position because of their longevity."
good,"Not a good place to work. Minimum wage ,poor hours and top of that dumb management. "
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot was stressful or relaxed depending on the day of the week. Management there was poor, and blamed the people below them for their mistakes. The hardest part of the job is keeping calm when all management gets irritated at you for making sure a customer leaves happy."
good,"The managment team is the worst o have ever delt with.they tell you one thing and do the opposite. They demand numbers or job loss is the outcome. "
good,"Beware of people who claim to be ""friendly and approachable managers"". Those very same people will chew you up and spit you out. It's not worth it...."
good,"3 years with the company, theres no advancing to full time ever! unless your a favorite. Enjoyed what I did, liked the customers and a few associates."
good,Every Manager at this store is lost and expects the workers to fix all of their problems. Employees would get punished for missing work because of school. Punishments would be like lack of hours.
good,"The only thing I liked was my coworkers, it was fun but other than that management was horrible. Store manager had no clue what she was doing. Front end supervisor would yell at you in front of customers. So many people would just walk out."
good,Its like going to high school all over again. Also be prepared to do everyone's job and not get any credit for it. You will not move up unless you are friends with management.
good,competitive 
good,"Overall you are overworked, no work life balance, and management doesnt care as long as goals are met and numbers/sales look good. You receive very little training and if there ever is a issue with you and you need help they dont care"
good,"When I first starting working THD, I had an awesome Front End Manager. He gave me encouragement and offered me the Head Cashiers position. He also encouraged Management to trained me to balance the tills from previous days sales.   He  was offered an HR position and transferred to another store. From there on my job became stressful. Also when THD raised their starting pay from $9 to $10, I was at $10 an hour as a Head Cashier and wasn't going to be raised. I brought the issue up and was told if I wanted more money then become an Dept. Associate. They would post job openings within, come to find out they posted those openings and required so many to apply and interview, knowing who they were already going to put in that position!  So I tried hard to make it there, but turned out not to be for me"
good,"At my Home Depot store, I dread walking in every weekend because I know I am not learning anything new at all with minimal opportunities to advance in the store. Another thing is, my schedule will change a day before my shift without giving me notice until I am already late, according to the new schedule I was not aware of. Along with the fact I get scheduled outside of my availability, for example, I have gotten scheduled more than a few times on a school day. Lastly, I need a day off here and there just like most people would, for a funeral, wedding, graduation or personal days. Whenever I know of a date I need off I will request it off several weeks in advance and hardly get it off which makes balancing my home life and work life very difficult."
good,"The Home Depot in Monticello, NY is a hostile work environment, where you can be targeted for any thing. The managers are rude, and do not care about how the customers really feel, no matter what they say."
good,For what it's worth I'm an overnight employee. I've heard mixed reports concerning the difference in the day time. There's a lot of work. Management doesn't manage well.
good,"This is a terrible place to work, you will have no opportunity to advance or make a living wage. As part time you are expected to have open availability but have no chance to advance"
good,If you are seasonal and are not a student then this job is fine. They work their seasonal associates very hard and then they don't actually give you a chance to become a regular team member.
good,"it was a cool work place but it was also favoritism, lying, backstabbing, just no one being honest nor being a team player. i learned a lot about customer service and the everyday working life."
good,Very stressful place to work we were always short staffed and the management would never help us out. We had multiple customer complaints a day due to short staffing.
good,"I was hired to be the assistant to the managers, as the current gal was soon leaving. she never did. they kept me in special services. HD has strick rules about have a cell phone on the floor, after a long time of consideration, i informed management of misconduct of a co-worker. i was discharged."
good,"It was a part time job. But when manager assigned a time, it was unfair. And my job was too difficult due to load and unload for a heavy concretes and stones."
good,"I liked working at The Home Depot. It was okay for the most part. I loved working with my friends. The benefits are very high, but the gym is really nice."
good,Not a lot of room to advance within the company which combined with low pay creates a frustrated work force. A large amount of physical labor that is not compensated efficiently.
good,"The company is ok. Some locations are better than others; mine was the worst. No work/life balance, little pay for skills, no chance for advancement, and they promoted incompetent people based on popularity."
good,management requiring impossible sales quota.     management looking to pad there own bonus check.....not careing anything  about any associate.........
good,Descuentan casi la mitad del sueldo por una falta.
good,"overall there's good workers but but bot many know what they are talking about when it comes to specifics on how the products work or what is needed for the job or project."
good,Management doesn't know how to talk to their employees. They treat them like slaves. The company goes through so many employees. They are running out of people to hire.
good,"I wouldn't recommend this employer, the salary is not inline with other retailers, The work conditions are deplorable, there HVAC is controlled by The Corporate office in Atlanta, The manager has to request an adjustment to the temp."
good,"Start at 5 am Straighten the aisles , Drop down from overhead stock to fill the bays .. Make sure safety bars are in place .. Offer great customer service through out my shift ... There was plenty of training on new products when they came out .. Management was not the best , problems with other workers were not addressed ... The hardest part of the job was work around customers during the day to drop more products as needed ( Blocking off aisles with gates ) to keep everyone safe .... The best part of the job was see the smile on a customers face after helping them with everything they would need to complete there project ....."
good,"Constantly occupied. Extremely busy and not enough employees to satisfy service to every customer. Very educational with online product knowledge classes, monthly message communication videos. Management is overall good. Mostly enjoy helping customers by educating them after I have listened."
good,"The culture and environment of the Home Depot has really gone downhill in the last couple of years as there is a corporate shift to employ more part-time associates and fewer full-time associates. Company is trying to do more with less, and, consequently, the level of experienced help on the floor has decayed. Fewer benefits available to part-time associates and not much movement to higher positions. Special bonus if you are bi-lingual or female, experienced white males need not apply."
good,"the home depot job starts with clean up and prep for the cost."
good,I have been with the company for 10 years-- It's been really hard to shift and move positions within this company. It truly goes by the motto it's know what you know but who you know.
good,"Freight team, unloading trucks, pack out. Management doesn't really care about their associates. The coworkers are freindly."
good,my typical day is I talk to customer and try to get them to buy their flooring quote put it is so hard to get help when u need it from management
good,"management plays favoritism... don't work to hard or you wont get promoted..have  seen the dumb ones who have no clue whats going on get promoted.  raises suck if your not kissing someone behind.  Reminds me of high school. I was told as a woman  I am to pretty and to ""dumb it down""  because I look like I don't belong working at home depot. Men are always promoted and paid more than women. left working in 2005 at 14.50 hour  and now only make 10. doing more work than the men next to me."
good,job/ life balance was not very good. They would drive everyone's hours up all week and then cut them on the weekends so there was no one to help in all the departments
good,"People who work there are very welcoming.  I think corporate needs to spend their time in stores not so close to home base.  Many stores need to be updated in plans as the future passes, and it would be beneficial for corporate to press the needs for better employee development to making work life nicer for their employees."
good,The management at home depot are terrible. the manager at the store do not care about the employee feelings. They love to pick and choose
good,Great to have on your resume but it is a sweat shop.   I.T. have tons of projects among each decentralize group.  There are a lot of stringent processes which involves toll gate reviews with several departments.  The frustrating part for project managers is the lack of control you have over your projects but the total accountability that you are responsible for.
good,"I would just wait for work, wait for someone to walk by and bumbared them with what we were selling."
good,"Patrolling the grounds around the warehouse. Dealing with trucks loads and driver to process them threw the gate."
good,"Was OK. People got hurt a lot, the boxes seem to a lot heavier then it displayed on the box. Sometimes 100 felt like 250."
good,"it was a decent minimum wage job, the people are friendly and honest for the most part. I learned a lot and gained good experience and references, became good friends with a lot of my co-workers, it just wasn't the job for me, very un reliable schedule, no room for advancement and it felt like I was just a number to the company rather than a valued employee"
good,"Typically a day was monotonous, boring, and stressful.  I learned nothing from the job, and management was lazy.  Everyone there was only there to collect a check. If you asked someone to help anyone outside of their department, it would not get done.  The hardest part of my job was having an irregular schedule with no consistency at all."
good,"Work was great working up front at the cashier with customers, attending their needs."
good,Come in to work everyday and help customers in the lumber dept. with questions and/or with stocking and loading lumber.
good,"want everything done with out telling you how to do it, don't care about home life i was let go cause i worked a 12 hour day then needed to get home to my newborn at the time, told me i had to pick my daughter being home alone so i keep my job or go home to my new born."
good,"On a Typical day I would Assist Customers, Stock Shelves, Inventory, Inform customers of tolls and products, Advise customers of what products and tools to use for their job or repair, Etc. The Management was OK, most of the time they were nice. My co-worker's were very enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was learning the job and all the products they have, they have terrible training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the clientele."
good,"Productive, busy, customer service"
good,Loosely managed at location where I was employed.  Ethics was low on priority.  Hardest part of job was physical demands depending on the weather.  Contact with customers was best part of job.  
good,"At this point in time of my life, I was a young college student just looking to make some extra cash on the side so I really cant give an overall persepctive on the job since Iwasnt able to stay with them for too long."
good,"My experience with the home depot was ok, i tried to do my job the best i could. The managemnet was not good, they were very back stabbing and just horrible. The employees werent that much better, i tried to do the best i could but when you have an employee trying to back stab you to further advance themselft.. its not a good situation."
good,work was hectic i did three jobs at once and didn't have enough time to get what the managers wanted me to get done
good,Customers were friendly. This job is mainly dedicated for teenagers who are still working there way through school. Management had no communications skills.
good,real hard working person and will get the job done.i stock the produce andsolve customer problem.worked with great co-worker and i love working with people.
good,Good pay. Some good people. You work hard for your pay. Favoritism. Not a lot of respect from management. They focus on their customers more than employees.  Short shifts. Make you do more then expected. No growth in the company.
good,Long hours and poor compensation. Clients were generally unfriendly and not a joy to work with. Management was terrible. They fired 20 people that were close to retirement.
good,I’ve worked in different store but some are terrible to work for. Pay sucks all the way around but I do get tuition reimbursement.  They need to treat us better at the store level. It’s hard to stay working for a company that has good perks but terrible management.
good,"Home Depot may be a good place for younger individuals that haven't been in the workforce and need to learn work ethics l"
good,"As someone who is responsible and gets his work done, the home depot seems to be one big ""blame game."" I do what I'm responsible for, filling shelves, helping customers, but if something is wrong near where I work but isn't my responsibility, it's now my problem because who ever actually has the responsibility to fix it won't unless babysat by management."
good,"I would greet the customers. Scan items and ensure pricing is correct. Charge the customer in the form of cash, credit card, check, as well as dispense the correct change."
good,"they do not give a cost of living increase, they treat going from part time to full time as a 'promotion'; minimum wage for less than half a work week is not a good job. just saying."
good,"Typical day at work includes much more brain power than probably any other department, but not matching pay. I've learned so much from the Home Depot which im very happy about."
good,"I enjoyed working at the home depot. However, they always wanted and expected more. I can not always give them what they want, because customers are free to shop any where."
good,"Management is lacking, mostly seasonal work. Will not pay for additional training, no preference for hour restrictions. Typical retail these days low wages, scattered hours and minimal training."
good,Wouldn't make me full time even though they worked me 40hrs a week. I had to move on. I enjoyed all the work. Forklift was fun to operate and the constant customer service was nice. I also did many presentations.
good,"There is no full time and no benefits for part timers."
good,Customer service .....home depot need to better benefits ...need to pay employees better..the most enjoyable part is the customer....online order and how to pr
good,The two years that I worked for the company I saw a lot of favoritism through management as their friends that were in the store got special treatment and got away with a lot of things instead of holding everyone accountable equally. A lot of laziness lot of talking and not doing their job !
good,Not much to say. I enjoyed the first 2 years until the culture changed to a numbers game and less of a concentration on service. That is when we started losing personel.
good,"A fun place to work. "
good,do not work there they do not value anyone or customer they only care about a bunch of numbers day in and day out.  the managers move and change the rules at each new location
good,It's not a bad place to work. Very friendly atmosphere. Everybody is nice and gets along well. Managers are nice. Flexibility is offered. Work with your schedule.
good,Will never work for a company who wont allow sundays off for family and church they dont care unless you work ooen to close every weekend  .  And during the week they just dont care about people
good,"great place fun people are cool , but managers dont have your back and alot of favorites , and they treat you like if your at High school,  cant get lunch break or restroom brakes , and they expect you to do everything for the same pay."
good,"In this particular store, the person in charge of scheduling is very incompetent and lacks understanding. Even though I would make requests to change my schedule, the hours the scheduler would put in we're very stressful times and too often and long. In this department, it's very physically intensive and working 6 days of 8 hour shifts back to back really wears you down."
good,sous-traitant veux dire avoir un bon coussin financièrement puisqu'il n'y a aucun avantage. Sommes payé au contrat.
good,"Your average retail job. Managers come and go. Some are great but for the most part you don't like them. "
good,"Picked this job up as a part time job to help my daughters college expenses. Training was easy, but customer service was terrible. They always sided with the customer even if you were verbally being abused, Nights until 10pm were not fun lots of crack heads coming in with stolen items looking for case to support their habits. Weekends, Employees always called in sick and management always expected you ato jump when they called you in."
good,"Inexperienced management.  Poor appoitments.  Little company support, they bully alot.  Training is weak, its learn as you go."
good,"Getting hired in at Home Depot Warehouse I was full of promise and loved the company culture. That certainly changed a couple of months in. You have to remember you’re just a body to them. No matter what sort of culture they preach, that’s what it is. I started out with a great manager who definitely had his favorites but was overall a great guy. Then all of the promotions started happening. I started seeing our hardest workers get turned down for positions they deserved or weee already doing but just not getting paid for. Promotions were more popularity contests than anything. (I should state that I never even tried to get a promotion so this is just an observation). Decent pay for how easy it is but horrible medical insurance that is often not worth what you pay for it. I should also add that you never get 40 hours a week unless it’s peak season. I found the work monotonous and boring as I like to be challenged more. They also are adamant that you do not talk about unionized working. They are strongly against this. I’m sure you can guess why."
good,"Enjoyed the experience here but management just was so toxic and hovered over everyone's backs for no reason. The ""projects"" they assign are totally biased and isn't equal opportunity at all and has a terrible HR Dept that is bad about scheduling"
good,They have favorites in the stores managers dont manage abuse of power they dont appreciate nothing they say they do but they don't nobody follows rules anybody could do what they want when they want an nobody tells them nothing because they are brown nosers you kiss butt  in the home depot you will make it far if you dont kiss butt an rebel they cut hours and don't acknowledge the work you've done.
good,"The .management at the store is very bad. Staff support is none existent. The company says it works on family values. I cannot speak for other stores but mine most definitely does not."
good,Home Depot is an OK place to work for. A lot of the times the managers play favoritism and it gets noticed. Some work a lot harder than others but don't get recognized for it. It's kind of easy to switch departments which is a good thing but as far as promotion goes its not easy to get one.
good,"Not the best place to work , a lot of favoritism but okay for a temporary spot . Pay is not great but it will get you by . They will use you when needed but not appreciate you for very long . They prefer to promote from outside so do not expect to move up ."
good,No time for family as a manger. Placing store managers in stores where they have peers they grew with is bad for other managers that aren't a part of the peer group.
good,"I actually enjoyed my job.  I was able to work in a department that let me use my skills and knowledge to  teach customers what to do and help them get their project from the idea stage to the work in progress phase and even completed. I was free to cross departments and use my knowledge to help not only customers but fellow employees improve their knowledge and skills.  I had a great department manager and store manager that learned what I can do and allowed me to make improvements to my department that increased sales and customer satisfaction.  The few downsides are that you don't really get paid what your worth and corporate policies have an effect of creating animosity.  Safety policy really needs to be revamped as well as the discipline policies.  Some violations you can never get out from under no matter how much you improve or time passes making virtually every employee be under the threat of instant termination by the end of their first year and  for the rest of their careers which fosters an ""I'm screwed no matter what I do"" attitude among associates."
good,The lack of communication and help with issues from managers is terrible. customers can be right in front of them and instead of helping they walk off or direct them to associates who are already assisting customers.
good,It was good when we had good managers. The job is entirely dependent on the whims of management. At the end of my employment they had a my way or the high way mentality that did not work for me considering I had school.
good,I started with Home Depot when we moved to Tennessee. I was a truck driver for 25 years but my wife and my children needed me to be home more. Home Depot provided a steady and consistent work schedule.  I enjoyed the work with the M.E.T team and worked hard to get promoted to supervisor. My wife wanted to move back to Indiana and I was able to secure a position in Indiana and transfer from Tennessee. I have noticed an extreme difference in the way the company runs here versus where I was in Tennessee. I do not enjoy the job as I did so I am looking to move on.
good,Home Depot has very good employees who work together.  Currently the store has 30 plus vacancies and can not attract good employees.  The company has to much turn over in management.
good,"They expect you to know everything, but don't teach you a thing. It causes people to yell at you because you don't know what to tell them. You stand around for hours and don't get a long enough or a break at all."
good,Would not allow for a steady schedule. Would not get a lot of hours. Schedule request were always denied. Very big gap on communication from manager to sales associates. Favoritism plays a big role in store.
good,"Typically work involves a lot of heavy lifting , bending, stooping  ,"
good,There is poor management. Too many people in charge slack off and leave all the work load on those below them. Employees seem to be held responsible for all issues while supervisors and management gets away with wrong doing.
good,Advancement opportunities isn't very good. Work schedule changes every week so you can't have a consistent life. Always work to do for other people...
good,"If you like talking and helping people this job is for you,retailing can be challenging.However,there all kind of costumer going in the store watch what you said and do. Do to the nature of the job people can be fire easy and not realize what they did wrong."
good,"constantly bounced around between departments (which required training for each, some of it extensive and time consuming). Work hours changed almost daily."
good,"Working as an order fulfilment associate in the store, I run into more customers than the average sales associate and am required to know about the various departments. This has lead to me being certified on almost any aspect of the business at my store, including fork lift operation, which has not lead to any incentives for my advancement, and I earn about the same as a cashier at my location."
good,management mostly focuses on part time employees.  I've had 3 store managers.  increasingly aggressive and rude.  Work isn't that hard.  training is good.
good,The company does not state minimum wage. It follows its own. Nobody gets a dollar raise. Some get $0.30 or 20 cents per year. Promotions are based on being a brown-Moser than on work.
good,"I worked in remote locations and I only had some challenges with the company's mileage reimbursement program which was very unsatisfactory. "
good,"I worked at Homedepot for a year and I have learned a great deal while working there.  Homedepot has its own benefits such as tuition reimbursement , healthcare and stock shares that benefit many employees. The hardest part about this job would have to be dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part about his job would have to be working with understanding and good co-workers and also gaining knowledge about how Home Depot operates on the daily basis."
good,"The management is terrible, they make it clear that you aren't appreciated. Chronically understaffed. Hard workers are abused and over-worked while slackers are promoted to department head and awarded with homers. It's not worth trying to make a career of."
good,When you first start working for The home-depot everything is great. After the first couple of weeks things set in and you will begin to realize how they really operate. If you want to advance in your job then you must reach goals that virtually impossible as a part time associate. As a part timer you are looked down upon and are no where near an equal to your full time counterparts. The credit for anything done will be taken by your department head who in most cases will hide in the break room most of the day while you and the other sales associates actually run and maintain the store.
good,Traveling a lot and team oriented. Ripping up old carpet and pad. Install new pad and carpet and pad as well as hardwood and or tile. Clean and organize work van after work.
good,"Mangers took advantage of the workers was too much , made them go get lunch for them, made us pick up after them . Send up to help out rude customers when they didn't want to."
good,"The management was ignorant the entire leadership based on reverse psychology and favoritism. The ignorance and power walking will gain a job not hard work or education. In fact the more hard worker or educated is an associate the more chance she/he will be ridiculed/ used and ignored in pay raise or higher steps. "
good,nothing much to say worked here part time the hours are inconsistent and part time is required to work every weekend which was an overall pain in my side
good,"Training was fair most of the time,  if you were a ""favorite"" you would get away with anything.  If you are not a favorite you will never get good respect.  I was apparently favored until I started noticing and bringing it to the attention of higher up,  then the trouble started.  Getting written up for things that were not my fault,  lack of help to make sure we all got proper breaks,  if you care about your job and work hard but are not a favorite,  it doesn't matter,  you will never advance.  They will give raises to ppl that's been there way less time while making other employees doing the same job that's been there years lower pay.  They need more consultant and HR is one of the major problems."
good,"Even the management isn't so great the overall employees that you encounter are amazing. They say they offer job advancement they really don't unless you suck up. And their attendance policy is ridiculous and so is there overall policy due to doctors notes ect,"
good,"Overall this job was good for either high school students that needed a part time or retired individuals, but not for an adult that has a lot of responsibilities."
good,"THe company sucks when it comes to assocaites, They always changing their schedules and not notifying the associate of the changes and then wants to penalize them for their own mistakes eespecially store #6845 Holland Tunnel"
good,"Basically, everything about Home Depot is a joke. Never expect to get any job advance without sleeping with the right managers....all of them. Home Depot was crawling with perverted creeps, and MOSTLY from head management like the store manager and assist store managers. The pay is barely over min wage and the hours are so inconsistent if you re PT"
good,"A typical day at home depot required you to be sure the department that you are in has its ""pack out"" list completed and you assist all customers in a friendly manner."
good,"working at home depot was like being in highschool, Upper management as not helpful in this. I had no security of hours and shifts could be close than open."
good,"Enjoyed my team in the paint department, but management was horrible and treats their employees like trash. Hard work and improvement go unnoticed. Turnover is horrific. Very happy to have moved on to other things."
good,"Head cashiers do not seem to care. I have to call several times to get more money when I run out."
good,"I am told it used to be a great place to work."
good,"Good place to work for. Assisted customers with inquiries regarding purchasing needs, Operated various equipment and machinery to cut lumber, plywood and glass."
good,u really had to watch ur step and what u say and to who. they don't want u to think for ur self. but they want u to do all these thing but don't want to reward u for any of them.
good,"current tucker store manager and some assistant manager can make it a tough place to work, a lot of drama but they also have great associates that are good and will help you out and are really proud of the work they do"
good,Working for home depot was a new experience for me and I enjoyed being apart of a company. This company helped people everyday in third world countries. Home depot was my very first job.
good,"At least in freight, you are over looked, over worked, and only one associate is full time. High turnover rates cause a decent amount of the staff to be under trained and lower on experience. While the associates on your level are, for the most part, really nice to work with, management has no idea what they are doing in regards to keeping freight team members long term. The pay is low and the probationary period is garbage. You can't call out more that 3 times in 4 months or you're fired. If you call out 2 times (or 3 and they for some reason keep you) you are put on another 4-6 months where you can't call out at all."
good,"There is no sense of direction at the store. No policy or rule was ever followed,  even by corporate.  It's as if they said ""f*** the rules we preached to new hires for two weeks straight,  who gives? "" don't work there if you want job improvement."
good,I love working at home depot but they dont offer full time and when they do its only to their favorite people. the people are alright.
good,Not a good job. Had terrible hours and they were always different I was never on a good sleep schedule. We always had a different supervisor and none of them like the way the other one did things and they would fight in front of the employees and it was not very professional.
good,I got along well with coworkers management didn't care about the problems we brought up.When you needed help and asked you would not receive any and wou be told to just do it
good,"Trams Dot Com was the parent company of 12 different merchants, that issued payday loans. You verified banking and employment information."
good,"I greeted and offered help to all customers entering store. Cashiered for Pro Desk, Returns, Self Check out line, Garden and any open lines. Sold over 150 credit cards in one year. Always stayed busy sweeping, cleaning and keeping stock in order during down times."
good,"Culture can be good, but is based on favoritisim. Not what you know, or how much of yourself you put into it. ""Cliquish"""
good,Depending on the store you work at it could be a very good place to work. Poor management practices at some stores cause associates to seek employment elswhere.
good,"I worked a the service desk, a extremely stressful hectic position. I learned a huge amount of customer service in the corporate world as well as order and vendor communications. Management of the store itself was friendly and helpfull. The hardest part of the job was dealing with corporate decisions that never failed to make your job harder to do. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people."
good,Overall work environment is friendly for the most part but is not a very organized environment especially for long term employment. They offer benefits but don't make them very available. They do pay more than minimum wage though which is nice.
good,i dont have very many good things to say about the home depot i worked at on the overnight crew we were supposed to have a crew of 14 people we had a crew of 3 for over 6 months and after the busy season was over the fired me and the other 2 guys and brought in 10 people to replace us talk about use and abuse their employees and throw them away like trash when they are done
good,"good times"
good,very demanding job low pay wierd hours always having to go no computer for classes very little training layed off right be being put on full time down to the last minute
good,"You cannot have a life outside of work. If you want/ need a day off put in for it at least a month in advance. If you get sick at work they will make you feel bad for leaving. They will not give full-time, so the most you can work is 27 hours a week, but require you to have open availability to even get a job there. If you open you have to be there at 5am. They are known for scheduling you to close (11pm is when you clock out) and then open the next morning. Cashiers get paid less. Don't count on a pay raise or growth in the business. The customers are rude, especially if you're a woman, and filthy, in behavior and hygiene. They are well known for under scheduling people to work, leaving customers and employees in need of assistance."
good,"The Morale at this store is sad, the scheduling is crazy instead of having teams for three shifts they have people all over the place. then they low ball you on pay, this job used to be fun years ago and now its garbage they hire teenagers as cashiers the adults who need full time positions cant get on unless they are kissing butt its like that say the quiet get everything and the ones that speak up get nothing but left behind. this ship is not run well at all. they have a ridiculous high turn over for cashiers."
good,The Home Depot was a nice place.  I enjoyed working there.  Very friendly co-workers. I loved helping my customers. The hardest part about working there was trying to lift 70-100 pound bags of concrete and soil.
good,I enjoyed being the head cashier at The Home Depot. I loved my customers and gained a relationship with them. Management could've been better but I was content.
good,"loved the associates I worked with. I got a lot of experience working there for 9 years. decent benefits,i met some great friends working here"
good,"Not a good company to work for. The benefits are not good, management team members are very incompetent and not a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,ring up customers of their items as cashier  in electrical department help customers find what they need or answer questions on items or how to install or if they got all that they need for their project
good,"There is nothing that I can say that won't be biased, or feel like a rant.  It's a great company if you are good at puckering up."
good,The job I had was as a cashier. There were busy days and slow days. Some of the head cashiers did not help you if you were new and had questions.
good,"Could be a great place to work if the middle management had people skills and the ability to communicate effectively.  The store manager is great however, he has inherited a poor support group"
good,"I have a mixed review about Home Depot, because there are a few pretty great areas inside the company. However there are also some areas that I feel could use some extra attention in fixing. "
good,"Stand at the store trying to get appointments with customers who wanted windows or siding"
good,A typical day at work would be to punch in and find out whether I would be working in the hardware department or as a cashier.  If l was working as a hardware associate I  would be stocking merchandise or assisting customers find what they needed in the department.  I learned how to sell products to customers.  Management was good but did not concern themselves to thoroughly train employees in their particular jobs.  My co-workers were fantastic and fun to work with.  The hardest part of my job was to figure out what I was to do in certain circumstances that I had not been trained in.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to work with the public and help them with their needs.
good,"Even though you learn a little of the job, you get paid to little for what you do."
good,Excellent for a part-time employer. Works around your schedule. Great people.
good,"5 years with the company,management is out of control,no chance of advancement ,i work as preparing order for contractors for 2 years, but my supervisor could not stop micromanaging.most of that department is miserable due to the lack of people skills.but as a job that would get you by till you find a new one"
good,While the fellow employees are great to work with the current management treats employees like a number and we are completely disposable.
good,I loved being a cashier for the home depot! great place to work except having to work outside in the heat in summer and freezing cold in winter. some of the management have favorites. promoted unreliable people.
good,"I loved the y something different it brought  every day."
good,"come in if there is work, or they need you take apart truck and stock the isles, hardest part not knowing if your gonna work, "
good,"worked three years , did excellent customer service, managers do not cooperate at all..... they like to make your life harder."
good,I enjoyed working with customers and giving them ideas to improve there life styles.
good,I enjoy the customers n helping them find their projects. but on the other hand my co workers did want to work as a team so I had to further my career in a non hastily environment.
good,really didn't enjoy the job due to the randomness of hours for available shifts
good,"I was the original Human Resources Manager for the opening of a new store. Very fast paced. High turn over, by virtue of the industry. "
good,"The Home Depot has changed since the founders have sold the corporation. Prior to this employment they offered much better wages and the opportunity for career advancement."
good,"they only care about there shareholders $$,not employees!!"
good,"I was terminated by my store's new management for taking off from work, with a doctor's note for my son's autism treatment which, I gave a week notification."
good,"My shift started at 6 am to 3pm. Received product, displayed according to directions, removed old product and sent out as requested. Used planogram and map of store for product placement. Serviced departments of store in different days by re-stocking, removing garbage, replaced missing labels, removed garbage left by customers. I was also in charge of clip strips and side caps of the store by replenishing and set according to store map and planogram.      I learned to work with others and share the knowledge I gained while being at work. What I enjoyed the most was seeing the final product placement and the difference it made to our sales floor. The challenging part of my job was locating the shipment. "
good,"I was working there through an agency and they sent alot of people home on a regular basis eventually they moved half the company to vaughn and did not re-hire us."
good,"over all it is a good place to work and benifits are ok,but not payed enuff need more money work with a good group of people management sucks. i learned how to drive a forklift and the hardest part of the job is when you are short staffed and it is extreamly busy"
good,"poor management, employees that i have worked with at home depot was very unhappy."
good,"A typical day included checking safety requirements are met, meeting and greeting customers, being available and knowledgeable about products. Also stocking where and when needed. Assisting other departments when needed. Cleaning the work area and making sure the department where I worked was clean and safe for customers. Making sales and giving estimates for customers. Also designing millwork items and quoting prices for customers. The training process was difficult as it was learning as you go-at the time I started, other co-workers were not that skilled with the computer programs, so it was a little difficult to learn right away. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers and finding what they wanted so they had an enjoyable experience, also my co-workers were very nice."
good,"Everyday is the same, unload freight from the freight liner, stock the shelves."
good, Adhered to company guidelines and return-to-vendor procedures in processing weekly damages.
good,I love working in a place where you deal with Customers and other Associates. I strive to make a change in other people's lives.
good,"It's not a bad place to work if you are working for extra money but if that's the only job that you have then it's very difficult. The Home Depot does not offer a lot of hours. I believe that to be the hardest part of the job. I work with a great group of people, the management time there is pretty awesome. It's hard to describe a typical work day because there are days when we just aren't busy and there is a lot of standing around, which I hate, but it is what it is and at least it's a job."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with,the best people to work with left after only a short time there. Management was being shifted around one manager didn't know what the other was doing, so you had a lot of mixed messages of what they wanted you to do."
good,"waking up at 4AM and only working 22 hours a week. inventory managment, price changes, counts, bay validations"
good,As a cashier my duties were simple. Listening to and answering questions of the customer made it easy to find the products they needed. I had to keep all displays near the registers stocked.
good,"Great company to work for, poor management structure!"
good,Core values are a joke. It is all about making sure you clock in and out on time. No overtime no exceptions. Going over your shift results in a write up and helping customers is not an excuse for going over your shift.
good,"you work closely with the customers, and you must have some knowledge of the products in your department, you do go backs, shelf matainance, and assist customers need daily."
good,"The corporate office is not known for work/life balance. To get ahead you have to be good at playing the game. Leadership wants like-minded thinkers, not different opinions. Not where you would want to work if you have ideas and want your voice to be heard. "
good,I love the work I do.  There just isn't much support with getting help with problems.  Under staffed and under payed.  No bonuses or employee discounts.
good,"It was my first job, quintessential first job. Not great pay. Not great benefits. I do hope that has changed over the years. But who is to say truly.."
good,Honestly working for them was a lot of fun for the first year. But while working there for the past three years i’ve come to not enjoy it much anymore
good,The store I work in does not put employees first it puts them last. My work is not appreciated 90% of the time. Barley anyone in the store gets promoted. Also I have been working for 1 year and still did not get full time. My work is not recognized and when I ask for full time I am put down and told there are no positions all this so Managers can get a big bones check at the expense of the workers hours getting cut. Company does not care about the workers just the $$ we produce.
good,"I really don't remember much. Great people, typical management in a retail establishment. When I was there, they ask for more when you give all you have."
good,The management doesn't actually care whether or not the employees' needs are met. It is obvious from the way they treat their employees that they feel that you can always be replaced if you don't like the employment situation.
good,"Great benefits, could be a great place to work but they are not for the employees nor the customers really just mainly about a quick dollars and number They"
good,New workers have to be careful there is no overtime and if you have some at the end of payroll you will have to take a four hour lunch and then comeback
good,"I worked inconsistent hours open up or close the store help customers with their  needs I stock shelves when we close or when we get shipments     "
good,"With several years in the Company my salary was not going up with the same rate as the people which had less years (they made more than me at 1 year on the job and I had several).  My knowledge was very good and the fact I did demos did not justify the low wage. Noticed the ""friends group"" moved up within the structure.  No upward movement even though I was Part-time and held a full time position elsewhere - they continually stated 'your part-time""."
good,"1. Must give your availability online at least 3-4 weeks ahead."
good,cleaning up after people spent half my shift doin that. then having to find rtvs is never easy. it is always a scavenger hunt. receiving coworkers are a part why I still show up to work.
good,Can be a great throw away job if you get under the right management. Part time roles will bastardize your sleep schedule with no consistency with shifts. Your sleep will suffer.
good,The company do not care about the employees and they do not allow the employees to operate freely.The compensation they pay for the work is not enough.
good,"I have worked there for about a year and a half. I have started out in their Deliveries department as one of their order pickers (Order fulfillment Associate). I was told that they needed me to put in a transfer for Lot department, last year, so I did and I haven't been able to transfer to another department since. For real, the only way I've seen anyone leave the Lot department is by quitting."
good,Same pay in every position.  Either way they get fed while you are their slave.  When they see that you need what's best; they will let you go.  Just keep looking for a better job.
good,Also you don’t get benefits until you work full time but you can’t work full time until you have worked there for 6 months.     I worked 39 hrs a week so many times but because it was an hour shy of full time then they don’t have to give me benefits.     And management was horrible at the location in Asheville
good,"During my time at Home Depot it was a very fast paced facility, teammates were always there to help you in anyway. i would go back if i could. loved this place. Management was there if you had any questions or concerns always ready and willing to help they did not only look at you as bosses but as a human being as well. They made everyone feel like we were a big family."
good,"I  worked a full year with home depot and raises, promotions, and benefits were close to non existent and rarely want to work with your schedule. Other than that its a job i guess so if you need money that badly then its a option."
good,"It’s definitely not a career job for people like me who like advancement. Promotions were offered to people who supervisors/ managers favor more. If you don’t play favoritism politics then this is definitely not the place for you. If you enjoy kissing up to people and faking to like people you really  don’t have to like, then by all means you’ll fit right in."
good,"They have very bad management and they are not fair at all with their workers, they talk bad about you behind your back and they don’t address any problems to you that need to be taken care of."
good,"Same old everything you would expect from a big-box retailer. It's a shame that this job could be so much more rewarding and considered a career if they would pay the people making money for the company. At this job I was constantly pushed to give them more and more without feeling as if there was a justifiable compensation to match. "
good,I worked at the service desk. Placed orders for customers via our website. Direct customers to correct find items and engage with employee in that area to assist. Hardest part of my job was knowing all the items available.
good,"This is a temp job. You won't move up at this particular home depot. The hours stay low unless the department is really hurting. The schedule is all over the place, so don;t get used to any particular set becasue it will always change"
good,I was told that I wouldn't work less than 20 hours per week but that isn't the case. I worked as little as 16 hours and management isn't very good. No career advancement
good,"Working here is fine as long as your a school student or retiree wanting too keep busy. Employees are really toxic towards each other and supervisors will throw you under the bus when given the chance. Each store has manager and several assistant managers with there own ideas. Really hard too keep up with your dept when a manager from another dept grabs you for theres. Also, dont bother learning to operate equipment, there is no incentive pay or anything except more work. Also, if you have an accident, you'll more than likely be fired."
good,"Employees are given poor training on the specifics of their jobs and are generally left on their own to figure out what needs to be accomplished during their shift.  I feel that most of the managers lack good organizational skills and are unqualified as ""teachers"" when trying to explain the basic skills required to handle the customers, tools, and machinery required for the various positions that directly interface with the clientele. Most knowledge for the different aspects of being a Home Depot employee is abdicated to canned computer programs that require completion to get the various designations or competencies.  Consequently, the company is constantly hiring to replace the very low paid personnel that is constantly quitting.  I found the morale to be very low.  Many employees are young, part time, or students that do not possess a good work ethic and don't seem to care if the obvious tasks required each day are completed.  Customers are constantly complaining about poor service and the absence of a feeling that the employees genuinely care about them or why they are even in the store.  I can only conclude that the reason that Home Depot does well in Santa Cruz county is that there is no competition from other companies that can match their prices and breadth of product selections under one roof."
good,There was no flexability with the schedual when it came to management.  Even when store manager is informed of needs they ignore them because of policy.  Yet other department heads are given exactly what they need.  Company does not allow enough full time positions necessary to provide the excellence of customer service that is expected by both customers and cooperate.  Work enviroment becomes toxic and therefore many look for other employment or loose faith that the company is truly listening to there employees.
good,Huge turnover. Great job to start. Too many management and philosophy changes. I outlasted everyone in my local office. DO NOT WANT TO SELL DIRECTLY TO HOMEOWNERS AGAIN
good,If you like to know you won't move up and you really have no job security go ahead and become someone who loves the work force of Home Depot. You work your behind off and get no credit for anything
good,"I’ve been with the Home Depot for 19 years. There isn’t any room for advancement. I make more than my bosses ,due to the lower pay scale they have everyone on now. Healthcare is terrible. Majority of the employees are part time status, and it’s roughly $700 a month for a family plan, not including vision or dental. So at $10 an hour at 20 hours a week, before taxes is $800 a month. Seniority means nothing to the Home Depot. That is a quote from the district manager’s mouth. You have zero seniority rights. They can change your schedule to whatever they want, no matter what you think. Their response is simply “business needs”. So they can do whatever they want. The Home Depot does not care about family at all. To sum it up, the Home Depot is just like wal-mart. Just another average retailer, and employees are just a number."
good,"A typical day is standing in one place for 5 hours and then being told I always did something wrong. I learned how to cater to a customer, but also how to take criticism. The hardest part of the job was not being able to move from one department to the other, and not feeling like I was being fulfilled."
good,Management is terrible and they hardly want you to advance. They play favorites here people. If you aren't one you'll know. The hours are cut non stop and they just hire more people instead of giving more hours. Not smart.
good,"No real way to advance, benefits are okay, hours are fine if you're full time, if you're part time they don't give you the best hours. Pay is low and they want you to stay at your current position. Raises are nearly nonexistent, and they expect you to work hard. Overall it's an okay place to work if you're looking for something to pass the time while you save for something better."
good,In order to move forward with this company its definately who you know. They make a lot of promises and dont come through. They give a lot of excuses why you arent moving forward or suggest moving to another area. There is no structure or regimen and management is very young and inexperienced.
good,"Fast paced, physically demanding in some positions. Offer cross training with no compensation. I was able to learn a lot about distribution and home depot. Loved my peers. Just to many politic antics."
good,"This job taught me a lot about retail, but for the most part the management was very incompetent. Some supervisors treated the employees badly. Workers were very much underpaid."
good,As an outside sales consultant you are inadequately equipped for the job and there are too many factors that control how you get paid that you have no control over.
good,Management has favorites....if your not one of them dont expect to move up.....they dont want to move you from the  position they put you in..no matter how many times you tell them
good,"Okay for a part time job to fill in earning gaps. Store Managers worried about their jobs too much to focus on getting anything done. Work culture is more cultish than culture. Excellent workers are discouraged, pay raises are laughable and usually trigger many of the freight team to quit when they are given. If you can focus on moving heavy stuff by hand quickly and efficiently, the job will suit you, if you don't think much about how littel others are working. Seriously laughable what Home Depot offers as a starting wage, and even when you're reviews cite you're efforts as exemplary, you get a .25 cents an hour wage!"
good,My experience at Home Depot was alright. The reason I’m saying that is because the store managers were lazy and rude. My supervisor was the caring and understanding person. He made sure everything was good for us. Working with and my team made working at The Home Depot a much better environment to work at.
good,"Working in the paint department. Product knowledge is key, learning about different products. Knowing where to find the answers, customers are looking for. Must be able to work together with other associates."
good,"management is fair but sometimes informed you of changes that don't happen, fellow employee are for the most part easy to work with and are willing to help each other out."
good,It was ok if your in high school or for a first job management didnt know what they were doing and no chance to move up i felt sacluded as a cashier being a male cashier
good,The culture of this company is in a constant state of change. The number of associates in the stores has plummeted since I was first hired in 1999. The same is true of the number of management positions and advancement opportunities. They have gone from a full time model to an almost exclusively part time model. The culture has changed from one of superior customer service at all costs to maximize shareholder wealth at all costs. It has also changed from a culture of growing people and training them to advance within the company to hiring 80% of all management and executives from outside. Associate training that was a forte in the past has become virtually non-existent. It is a company that has lost it's way in pursuit of profits that it used to see before the changes in culture were introduced.
good,Worked at Home Depot for over a year starting at 10$ they gave me a 10 cent raise after a year. Manager would also make empty promises and tell other Manager you didnt work hard enough behind your back. Home Depot raised their minimum wage to 11$ for everyone being hired so people like me working in lumber dealing with concrete dust and lifting all day long would be paid the same as a cashier that had to make small talk and scan items.
good,they care more about the sales then the workers. they don't care about the workers health. the pep of the work place is low and the management team only cares about making numbers
good,Trying to get promoted or full time at home depot is probably the biggest challenge. They hours are usually flexible and you can learn multiple departments.
good,I've worked for both big home improvement companies and The Home Depot was not very organized. I was use to having a work sheet on what I needed to do and what needed to be done that day. Also the location I worked at the air conditioning did work all the time so it was hot in the building. In my department me and my coworkers had to have a big fan to help cool us down.
good,"Good overall company but need to review some field management.  They dont always follow up to to see where the actual problem can lay sometimes and put too much trust in people who will take advantage of them.  The company overall is a good company, just some bad apples spread out.  Guess thats pretty much everywhere."
good,"The work is easy, the coworkers are nice, but some of the mangers (not all, a small few) won't help you and won't get back to you with anything.They rarely offer extra hours to work even if you work less than 20 hours a week."
good,"You get to work with some interesting people. Customers dont care about you, they expect you to worship them. Contractors are always googling the girls there, and management doesnt care because they are the ones who told the girls to wear low cut, boob showing shirts."
good,"Home Depot is a pain in the butt. Yes, I enjoyed my job but only because I enjoyed the customers. Management was extremely difficult. If you got promoted you were either lucky, good at your job or sleeping with someone. And most of them weren't good at their jobs. I wasn't able to get anywhere at that company. I stayed in the same position for 3 years! Part-time cashier. I couldn't even get them to make me full time instead they hired new cashiers onto fulltime. It was BS."
good,"I literally lost my mind and ended up hospitalised because of the stress of working at this store."
good,Working for Home Depot was a nightmare.  Always under scrutiny and belittled by management.  Even when you worked your hardest the work you did was never appreciated.  And if you wanted to move up in the company they always found ways to no make that happen.
good,"Many people did not like working here and a lot left because of management they push you really hard which is understandable, but the bosses expected a little to much out of people in such a short amount of time. I am personally ready to move and further my career into a great place like this with movement and opportunities!"
good,"Its a good place if you don't have major bills to pay or children to provide for. They are flexible with hours, and try to accommodate needs. It's not a reliable job if you depend on steady working hours."
good,"fast paced, stressful, management didn't listen to employees and played favorites. was forced to work other employees dept. and their freight. hardly and backup"
good,"If you like seasonal you will like working here,, the hours for seasonal is great but when you are trying to raise a family it doesn't work. and there is no moving forward in your position they have there own special people"
good,"Never shortage of projects to complete, though difficult sometimes, nothing that cant be completed with team work, comprehension, able to take direction, and knowledge of tool useage"
good,When come a Department Head all management tell you that your are a manager when dealing with customer so sometime you have to tell customer no ( and yes sometimes they are upset ) then new store manager tells you are not a manager.  Had one store manager tell everyone in store that I was promoted to assist manager but in fact I wasn't. At this point lost respect at store because this.
good,"I worked at 5 Home Depots, this one is the worst run. Staffing is minimum for the amount of work that's expected. Those that don't perform well don't get reprimanded."
good,"The job mostly consisted of you making sure that the aisles are set up and clean, you would also help customers that came by as needed, then on certain days after certain shipments you would be put to work putting up heavy items on high shelves by yourself. When doing this it was very hard work, when not doing this it was very boring"
good,I liked the job because of my customers they were very friendly and they were really The onces that help me to keep going so I can have at least some kinda income coming in for my children. Home Depot really did teach me a lot and with the education they gave me I used all of it to be the best I can. Im very thankful it was a good experiences i couldn't and shouldn't pass it up and no one else should neither if they have the chance. They teach u alot of different things you can take to other jobs like as a trade u know your good at.
good,The job was very stressful . Poor management. Low salary . They however had great benefits like health insurance and 401k. And the 401k was matched 100% annually which I found it to be greater opportunity to take part if you work for them.
good,"Not a great place to work. Constantly told you will advance in the company yet you are consistently held back. Management was brutal, all for one, no one worked together to better the work environment. Everyone is miserable all the time, it was always someone else's problem and management will do the least they can to help. The most enjoyable part of working there was punching out at the end of the day."
good,"Poor training, commissions were always short, quality of appointments were generally poor, mandatory Saturday ""events"" without compensation, not much cooperation with store management or employees, appointments could be 8am, to 9pm and cover a large area, some sales tools were scarce, not all sales consultants were treated the same, had to fight for your money"
good,"horrible place to work. cut hours, no overtime. small healthcare, no employee discount. different managers on duty everyday. unclear rules due to different managers."
good,"Not enough hours. "
good,"Worked for the company 9 years and was very disappointed the last 2.5years with the lack of communication, unprofessional store walks and the requirements for supervisors during these store walks and some meetings. "
good,"The Managers did not lead--I guess because of the pressure to perform. It felt like everyone thought they were my boss, always expecting me to go above and beyond. In order to give the best customer service I could, I just had to take it. All without any recognition."
good,"Really fast paced invironment to work in. "
good,"This is a awesome company if you are working at the corporate office not the annex, it’s very hard to get out of the call center environment, if management like u they will get you out of the department, if they don’t then u stick"
good,"This store can be a lot of fun to work at, there are always things that you can do. Everyone can be trained to operate some of the large equipment such as forklifts and order pickers. You are often asked to do things that are outside of your department or qualifications."
good,All in all home depot wasn't bad. most of the associates were fun to work with and easy to get along with it. but there wasn't ever really much more to look forward to.
good,"Working there at the beginning was fantastic. The managers were great and the workers were so nice. After a while, coworkers began to get a big ego and I was not advancing in positions I knew I deserved."
good,"Some good times there, a fast paced job, for sure; especially Saturdays.  I loved my boss.  The others were ok.  Most of the people were awesome.  You are treated childlike tho,"
good,Lead generation needed help. Third party leads were mostly bad leads. I also had to pay all auto expenses myself with after tax dollars. Also had to work a six day week and ended up without a day off for 3 months.
good,"The most unfair thing about working here was how little you are considered as a person and how heavily you are considered as a mule. As long as you're fine with getting the most work possible squeezed out of you every hour for a measly $10, with no compassion for being ill or needing to focus on school or other obligations such as family, then this is the place for you. Other than the management, this place would be a fabulous work environment aside from the lack of opportunity for advancement above part time and stooping as low as possible for a customer's every and any need, including putting up with a full hour of harassment from male customers. The pay rate would be fine if the work load did not involve allowing harassment and maybe some better breaks."
good,The job for other people may be nice. Not so much for me. The late shifts if you were lucky to get them outside during all types of weather was dangerous. Manager was very evil. Good Riddance
good,"I was an employee at The Home Depot for a year and was both assertive and compsssionate as a Front End Supervisor. I successfully led over 45 employees and our store became number one in credit and Voc/metrics throughtout the duration of employment.    "
good,The overall atmosphere of the building was not pleasant. Managers would favor other employees. Management was not overly willing to work with the staff to meet the needs of the staff with regards to scheduling.
good,"Home Depot is an ok place for people to work for,very busy and not much for advancement.My department was extremely busy always having to look busy and keep busy."
good,"Send an email to managers requesting a reply of confirmation, no response. Only cares about sales numbers. Product training does not exist show shoot from the hip."
good,When I worked there it was nice. The only issue I had was i was terminated while on maternity leave. After I was terminated the management changed and has a stricter policy.
good,Good people just bad management. The employees were good always had smiles. Good Job and good employees. Hopefully Management realizes the talent they got before they all leave.
good,"Don't expect anything halfway decent for the amount of work that is expected. management won't care unless they could be in trouble for something. But if you do show up and work, the associates that do the same make it worth staying (at least until something better comes)"
good,"It is really hard to get a full-time here. New people start out as part-time and work their way up. It depends on who you are as to whether or not you get the full-time position or new job that is posted. The pay is not what it used to be and raises few and far between. I worked there for about 8 months and never got a raise. Another woman I worked with was there for about 10 years and was only making $11/hr, that was only $1 more than what I walked in making. Those who were grandfathered in after the new CEO took over got the maintain their previous pay but that pay rate is long gone for any new hopefuls."
good,Wouldn't recommended working there. When I had the number one inventory in the store.only one asst store mgr said way to go. and he was not in charge of my department
good,For the job I had I feel I was not trained well enough before having to do it on my own. Not being trained made for a very stressful day. I was working part time at never knew what the full time person had done.  Lack of communication from her made it hard for me.
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for, just not the one in Sierra Vista AZ."
good,"The job sucks for the most part. No one knows anything about what they want or where it is. They think you know where everything is, but you spend your entire life behind a register so you have no clue. If you like standing around then this it the job for you."
good,Management picks who they want to grow with the company not people who have the experience. Its from the agm down that does the favoritism. Things need to change in this place or people are going to leave. The pay is not that great as well you still have to work a second job to make ends meet.
good,It's ok for part time work for someone going to school or a retired person. Nothing to write home about. I get bounced around on hours. Work about 4 hrs in the morning during the week. Sunday evening about 4 hours.
good,"The focus of staffing and payroll according to forecasts instead of planning the week based on high impact days.  Short Staffed most of the time, employees don't seem to help customers like they use to, now they ignore most people.  Poor workers seem to advance while good workers get left behind and not offered advancement."
good,"Just not what they advertise them selves as being. They have their value wheel but they dont always live by it, only when its to their benefit. I would not recommend this company to work for. They are not a balanced fair company, people are not treated fairly."
good,Bad thing is that they show favoritism to certain employees. but its a nice slow paced store where you can really get to know the people in the store.
good,"yes its a warehouse . great to learn  about the structure of warehouse work at home depot , but not a structure of interpersonal relationships with employees."
good,"Home Depot is a good temporary place of work. Very productive and willing to work with all schedules within reason."
good,"Management would mistreat their employees and demand certain tasks be performed that were unsafe.  Much time was spent making the store ""look"" presentable for top management, not for customers."
good,It was too much favoritism and no growth room. They only promoted friends and family. Not enough skillset matching or respect for skillset. Management ran on emotions rather than logic. It makes for a suppressed experience.
good,It is a corporate job. I don't care for the people I work with. Everyone is trying to step on each other to please the boss. It is high school. The benefits are good.
good,"With any retail job there are good things and bad, for Home depot the good things was learning the basics of Do-it-Yourself, the bad was that it is retail."
good,"Archaic technology,work rules and compensation. Home Depot does not pay a living wage to workers. Cost of family health insurance does not meet federal standards."
good,Good people that mean well but are not flexible. Don't compromise or listen. Only enjoyed isolation away from most customers.
good,"Management shows a very high tendency of favoritism. "
good,never enough employees to cover store and employees expected to cover departments even if they had little or no knowledge to assist customers
good,"I worked at the Brenham, TX. location and the job advancement opportunities were menial at best.  There is a network there that is impenetrable.  Training was horrible. They sit you in a room with no human interaction. It's strictly computer based for one week.  Then when your released to the floor the expectation is that you know what you're doing and should do as they say and not as they do.  There is constant contradiction between corporate policy and store policy.  Don't fall on the wrong side of the haves and have-nots, you are quickly relinquished of your services."
good,"Started out as a fun job, but when department supervisors got moved around, the job went from fun to extreme labor, always worked way more hours than what was scheduled, and the job was never done, it was frustrating, and exhausting.  after being there for a few years new employees got hired at the same pay or more than what it took you to work up to.  Definitely on the list of worst places to work"
good,"management needs improvement. To many managers causes confusion in duty performances. Hours are not flexible, asking for a day off is impossible even if you ask 2 weeks or a month in advance, mangers have no relationship skills with employees."
good,Overall pretty good company the promise to promote within not so great. I work tirelessly and feels like no reward. I had some medical issues within the first 4 months of employment and they understood and I will be forever greatful. In just looking for something new.
good,"company would be ideal if they offered more OT and management would be more officiant, but all and all decent place to work, requires more growth opportunity"
good,"Always busy never boring. Getting promoted is about favoritism. Must be a self starter, training sucks. Company very stable so job security isn't an issue."
good,"Your job was more important than your life outside .If you had any family issues you had to but it on the back burner. The management at Home Depot was not at all willing to see what was happening outside ."
good,"The problem with Home depot is that it's no diversity in management positions. If you are a minority you will work the lowest positions in the company like freight, lot attendant, cashier or garden. Home depot also don't allow unions in. If they catch you speaking about a union then your fired.. Home depot is not a career it's a job."
good,"Learn as you go. No training by supervisors while on the job.  Since there is very little supervision, many associates do as little as possible."
good,"Management is unfair on how they comensate their employees. Someone could be there for 5 years with loads of experience and is a woman and a guy comes in, less than a year and makes more than the expeienced girl. Management likes to hire outside instead of giving someone in the store a promotion. Benefits suck and you work a crazy up and down schedule. nothing is consistent."
good,The management does not effectively communicate with associates. Associates are written up for following directions of management. Pay is barely above minimum wage even for skilled labor such as forklift operators. Associates are not offered any type of employee discount at all.
good,"Try not to get any complaints from customers or you will be terminated. Make sure you call in when you are sick. They are very picky whom they promote."
good,I just feel like all they want is money. They don’t pay a good starting wage. They don’t try to work with you schedule. Once they told me they needed bodies for a shift I couldn’t work. That doesn’t seem like a good way to look at anything.
good,worked in lumber stacking wood unloading trucks with fork lift also restacking lumber shelve with fork lift. stack cement and sheetrock with fork lift help customers find and load building materials aldo cut plywood and lumber to size
good,"its who you know, not how hard you work. if you didn't grow up and go to school with these people you have no chance of advancement."
good,"It was a sucky place to work. If you are okay with Corporate retail hours and Management it is not a terrible place to work."
good,"One of the things that was enjoyable working for this company was being able to interact with customers that came into the store, helping them with whatever needs and questions they may have had."
good,I interact with all types of customers informing them of any promotions THD is offering and make a sell if possible. If it is a slow paced day I work on quoted orders and follow up with a transaction or I help maintain a clean and uncluttered environment.
good,"I enjoy my position at the home depot. However, I need a job that will give me more hours and I'd like a change of career. My hours keep dropping and I need more hours so that I can provide for my children."
good,Promised management position but due to management turnover and not being a lifelong HD employee previous experience was ignored.  Management position was never a possibility.
good,"Work your tail off and no rewards. "
good,Home Depot is not store you want to work. They treat their staff wrong and they is favoritism. If you are not in with in crowd you are no one.
good,"Its not to good, only if you have a high position. The money is not that good either. I just suggest this job for young adults trying to get a job. Be on your best behavior!"
good,good prices compared to lowes-better customer service -needs some improvement-not perfect but very close.-can order on computer and pick up in store-good selection on hand of most products-great buys on special buys at store throughout the year.
good,Store was always understaffed and all new hires were paid low wages.  The managers would pretend that they cared about the associates and the core values but did not practice what they preached.  Managers were lazy and would not help the associates.
good,"I loved my job! A typical day was filled with reports, customers, great staff and good old fashioned physical work. It was fun to be part of a group of people that wanted to present the best store possible, and they took pride in giving the best customer service possible. The part that we all hated was the inability of the management team to communicate, to make and follow consistent policies, and to be part of the whole store team. I feel like the manager had been in place far too long, and favortism was everywhere. Home Depot had once been a company that you could move up in fairly quickly, but I found that in Saskatchewan that was no longer possible. I was laid off after a manager restructured the store, only to find out 3 months later that my job had been posted..I am not bitter as I have moved on to greater things, but I am sad that a company that was fun to work at, had great career choices, and great benefits had moved to such a war zone at one point, and that a manager could let politics tear a place up. All good businesses succeed if they have a great management team that trusts and works with their staff!!"
good,Great for experience. I am in the culinary field so this position was very beneficial for myself. Hopefully this will open the door for someone who wants to go in this kind of job. be prepared for long hours and hard work. But once accomplished this should make you feel great.
good,"Management is horrible, they cant communicate with each other let alone with the supervisors so we can properly run our departments to store standards until last minute."
good,"The Home Depot is a friendly place to work with flexibility in work schedule.  However, the management team are very difficult and do not hand out praise, except and for those that are the ""favorites"" or those who may the most ""noise.""  Advancement is almost impossible unless  you are, again, one of the favorites or someone who has made a lot of noise and complaints."
good,"This company, for it's size,  has a lot of work to do to be a great employer. There are a lot of people in management positions that really have no business being in that level of role. The company is employee-centric to a fault and makes it difficult to have an actual professional environment. The atmosphere is very cliquish like in High School and basically the same kind of drama as high school."
good,"Working in a do-it-yourself environment i learned a lot about fixing things and completing large and small home improvement projects. with the help of relatives i actually renovated a bathroom at home. this ob was a great learning experiance, but it was not what i wanted to do for a personal career."
good,"greeting customers with a smile, processing the purchase quickly. Fun respectful co-workers. management isn't the best. the hardest part is knowing that you cant survive day to day with the pay and work hours are not always a guaranteed"
good,"Every day, you engage in backbreaking work for a meagre wage. On top of that, management rides on your success and reams you for failure when they set the bar too high."
good,"8 1/2 hour shifts any day of the week Mon thru Sun with half hour lunch."
good,"A typical day consisted of inventory management, working with employees to ensure that there daily, weekly, or monthly work lists were completed in the department in a timely manner. Discussing with employees why they were not completed and offering assistance if needed. Ensuring that lunches and breaks were taken when appropriate. Working with ASM's on projects, such as setting up sales promotions, changing end caps, etc. to complete them in a timely and efficient manner. Working in other areas of the store when needed. This is just a brief overview of a day at work."
good,"Loved my co workers, the pay was bad. The should pay workers more and offer more flexibility"
good,its a fun place to work i really enjoy it and i think that you will enjoy it too the only think i dont like was dealing with angry customers but all you have to do is help them the best you can.
good,The time i worked there the managment did not take enough care of the peopel who were the part time employees. And as a veteran i felt like i was treated badly and talked to as if i was a child on several occasions which was not ok and no one done anything about it. I was also fired the very same day i had put my 2 weeks notice in because i notified managment i was going to be attending the police academy
good,"Management set high standards for low pay.  Had no desire to give time off when a person wanted it,  it was all about the bottom line and not about the staff or their needs."
good,"the people that I work with are friendly and out going. the job is a great job, I work hard every day for the company. just need more hours, home depot doesn't care too much for there employees."
good,"A heartless place to work in. Associates are mere numbers. In one store a youngster refused to write his name on his apron, instead he wrote his employment number. Apart from an indifferent attitude from the top brass, I enjoyed meeting customers and the company of the associates. The Home Depot s not devoid of discrimination. I was a victim and to compound it had a new Assistant Store Manager who was a BULLY. He did not like me standing up to him. Certain policies were questionable. At one town hall meetings (the only one I was ever invited to ) I questioned the way awards were bestowed on some favourites. Because there was no answer I was in their cross hairs. After Eight and a Half of service there and being considered in the top 25 associates in the district an and worker 'To Go To' I was laid off."
good,I really just dislike this company which is why I am seeking new employment. There are a lot of things and problems with working for this company. Although it may be for some people it DEFINETLY isn't for me
good,"This big retailer IS a very good retailer and I have found I DO like to do retail work.  Management could be better (present new staff excepted). I like the co-workers for the most part and we have fun among ourselves. I like interacting with the general public and helping them find what they need.  It is a carry over from my previous jobs in radiation therapy.  The two carreers are a mile apart, but good careers just the same. However, I am heavy in the therapy world and love it. Home Depot is a good place for someone who is not looking for a meaningful career or plenty of hours. They deal wholly in college students and a few older specialists. Overall, I like it, but feel I am not being used to the best of my ability. I have been and presently am taking computer training in all depts.  Each day is a lot of idle standing at the registers when it is slow. When it is busy, I love it. I have been #1 in the store in credit for two years and this last year I finished in the top 25 in the Region."
good,"Home Depot is a great company. They ARE too expensive, however the employees are well able to help people with their projects."
good,"Had effective results assisting customers, while helping fellow associates with understanding the common problems and solutions to electrical problems. Was also able to assist customer throughout the store with my extensive background in construction."
good,"no leadership, had to be self motivated to get work done, mentor to others. learned retail sales and how to operate forklift, reach truck, OP truck, and electric ladder, had great relations with coworkers. "
good,"money was pretty good. had several 1200 dollar checks weekly. but that's because we worked 15 hours a day, 7 days a week for at least 3 days straight. good for a single man."
good,The work environment is biases. You only get promoted by popularity and not by working skills.
good,"Theres no job security in a deportment. If the store manager feels you need to be fired, even if you could bleed a case, he/she will still feel the need to let you go."
good,"home depot was a lot of fun to work for up until about 3 years ago when the company lost the family/employee core values, sad as it is I imagine it happens with a lot of big money makers"
good,"ASM's usually work 55-65 hours a week due to pressure to perform on a daily basis, rarely rewarded for accomplishments and not allowed to make time for personal and professional success"
good,"This position has taught me patience and the ability to multitask in a stressed environment. Because I hold a part-time position, I get many closing shift where I usually work with no aid. Unfortunately, there is a shift in management with a new supervisor and the transition has not smoothed itself out yet. The hardest part of the job is to receive an adequate break at the proper time due to lack of coverage. the most enjoyable part of this position is interacting with the public. "
good,Besides doing my regular duties. At times there wasn't anything to do. I had to wait for something to happen.
good,A typical day at work is very unorganized you are all over the place with no clear or concise direction from management.
good,"Loved the people I worked with on Overnight, yet the pay was horrible."
good,"greet customers, help customers find products they need,provide knowledge about products,create orders (special orders) for flooring, blinds,backslash and related materials, answer phone calls, cut flooring,(carpet,vinyl) cut mini-blinds, pack down inventory, clean, straighten merchandise, move merchandise, build displays for merchandise, put up returns,etc..."
good,"The home depot has a great training process they just don't implement it correctly. They use to have great core values and took care of there employees, not anymore. the environment on the other hand is great the friends that eventually become family. The few employees there that still live up to the values that the home depot use to stand for are slowly disappearing finding better opportunities to actually grow and make livable wages. the hardest part about my job isn't the work load or the customers or the training. its the fact that as employees at the home depot we do our jobs and we ""go above and beyond"" and at the end of the day we still get treated unfairly"
good,When I was hired here they told me I would be hired on full time but I didn't. I learned more about cashieering through them but that was pritty much all.
good,"mostly night shifts, no employee recognition, politics as usual. no employee support"
good,"I was receiving supervisor, department manager, and lift equipment trainer"
good,"During my employment at Home Depot the store location I was employed at was a very hostile environment. Reason being, there was exposed racism where comments were being made towards certain employees. I learned about various products and the structure of electrical layouts of residential and industrial buildings. In addition to the size gage, circuit breakers, panels, and florescent lighting."
good,Loved working with my customers. My customers would come in and ask for me by name. i loved pleasing my customers making them happy made it all worth it
good,Good perks from different companies for working at Home Depot. I really loved my customer service job.
good,"Unload trucks, process freight, make appointments, daily paperwork, process freight to sales floor"
good,Great company to work for. Employees and even customers become family.! Benefits are great and hrs aren't that bad.
good,"Typical day, there were no typical days, each day had it's own challanges."
good,"This place is for individuals with little or no responsibility as it doesn't pay much. However, the atmosphere is fun and you get to meet a lot of new people"
good,Working here can be fun depending on the manager. Good managers have loyal employees & bad managers have high turnover for new employees.
good,If your young and need a job to pass the time yes this is for you
good,not a good place to work for now they are not pay much at al it use to be fun but not anymore
good,"A typical day working for the Home Depot is non-stop trying to play catch-up on existing problems, while still maintaining a balance of good customer service and dealing with the daily challenges that surface nearly every single day. I learned a great deal about not only time management, but also how to manage a retail business from the ground up, both on an individual level, a department and store level, as well as on a company level. Learning everything from basic sales techniques, to better customer service relations, in addition to inventory control, helped me to understand the complicated and always political workings of the P&L. I grew to know my co-workers as either under-motivated and /or fearful of the loss of their jobs because of the always diminishing roster of employees compounded by the ever-increasing workloads and expectations that are placed upon everyone, especially with the Department Supervisors. Those that did speak up or tried to improve or change things for the better, either became so frustrated from the management ignorance, that they outright left on their own, or were gotten rid of by some 'non-retaliatory' means by the management. The hardest part of my job was just forcing myself to go to work every day. In the end, the only enjoyable part of my job was that every once in a while, I could still train new associates in old school proven methods for the education and true assistance of our customers. This is all that our customers really want, to have somebody that is knowledgeable, interact and honestly assist them."
good,"Decent compny, long hours, horrible management, re applied several times, management wasnt nice about the job inquires. Despite the fact that i left on good terms."
good,Great place to help people with new ideas to improve their homes.
good,"The benefits were very good. The values,job security, and life balance has changed for the worst in the last year. Co. only cares about making money and do not care about their employees. Years ago it was a much better company. They cared about the employees."
good,"I started The Home Depot in 2017 as a cashier and I LOVED IT. I never had anybody train me 101 I just kind of learned as I went along. There’s promotional opportunities within the company but nothing is ever promised of course. Everyone was great and everyone was happy to help when I needed it. But after a while it seems like they got rid of all the employees/managers that actually wanted to work, cared about the job at hand and had good work ethic and hired just ANYBODY. Very safe working environment but We always had people stealing (duh) and As associates we can’t do anything about it but offer to check them out. Sometimes when we offered to check them out they would threaten us. We had men that would come in and catcall and do other things that made us feel uncomfortable. One time I was poked in my rear end and with pvc pipe and when I told management they made it seem as if it was my fault. I never felt safe as far that goes but when it came to actually working safe I was 100% ok. I also did BOPIS for a few months. That was the best part. In the summer hours are GREAT. as a part time associate I made more than I would at any other part time job. In the winter HOURS GET CUT DOWN TO 4 HOURS A WEEK until early spring. I’ve recently been hired at a different company and will soon be leaving the Home Depot. Very good job for a little while if you enjoy a fast paced work environment and learning new things on the job every day. Just not something for long term employment unless you’re full time."
good,"Little to no interest in individual employee's well being.  Poor, ineffective middle management.  Not community oriented.  Minimal give back to community.  Rigid rules that just don't make sense."
good,This company was a good company years past but now it's all about appearances. Employees are just a number to them. It's not about doing the right thing it's about not offending anyone ( associates or customers).
good,"There are a lot of good things about working at the home depot like the environment, tools and things you will learn. However management often dose nothing."
good,it is ok for a fill in job not enough money but you can move up by learning other departments.  The company is close to my home and works around my schedule.
good,"If  you are a free thinker, this is not the place for you. In the store that I worked in, if you brought anything up that in a meeting outside of “the agenda” you were out of line. No freedom to do anything to try things to improve sales."
good,Work was just a bunch of back and forth. Training is never hands on. Pay was to low for Merchandiser because they seem to do the store associates jobs also! Projects made no sense. Start time was to early. Not enough sick time was given. Internships were only given to those in college and not for those who wanted to move up without going to college!
good,"Changing company. Lower compensation for incoming associates. Poor work life balance i.e. schedules,  management shift coverage, no advance notice on extreme shift changes (days to overnight etc.). Poor management at all levels. Essential product variety / services, missing in many areas. New associates not trained properly. Benefits are good and a good job for part time in some areas. Recommend for part time work or if you want a high stress retail career that pays well at the store manager level."
good,The environment was not what I thought it was. The management were more for themselves. As long as the truck was finish thats all they cared about. The christmas party was off the hook though. And they love to feed you.
good,convenient job but poor paid and limited opportunities. My supervisors had been there many years before getting promoted and become full time. There is some promotional opportunity but you have to agree to bad long hours.
good,The Home Depot is perfect for high schoolers but the advancement in this company is hard because you either have to know people or kiss butt to get to the top.
good,"Typical day would be to come in and just start down-stocking, and that’s not a hard job but you also have to take care of customers. The thing that sucks is that there’s a recovery team, freight, and MET team that is supposed to stock and take care of the store while you answer people’s questions, but NO ONE does their job or does it right. The freight team actually almost always makes a mess of of the store and I don’t blame them. The manager for fright is always someone with a power complex that makes them not leave the store for lunch unless they finish all their work. But some how you are comepletely responsible for how the store looks and you’re in trouble if you’re not stocking, but also in trouble if you’re not paying attention to every single customer. Now I have learned a lot about building things and home improvement from just reading the backs of product, but not because of management at all. When you’re hired, they make you watch videos about common sense work place rules and then send you on your way. Customers will get so frustrated with you that you’re not a expert and can’t tell them how to rebuild their lawn mower and good luck trying to get a hold of someone who does know or a manager because 1) the communication system is awful, 2) because the schedules are ALWAYS ridiculous. I was thrown into hardware without my permission, and was scheduled by myself a good 70% of the time. Maybe it’s different at other Home Depot’s but at the rockwall location, the HR does NOT care about your schedule or if you’re more comfortable in one department over another. Now I don’t"
good,home depot is a great company but as we all know not all  representatives of a company have the greater good in mind this seemed to me st the location I was at that bare minimums were met and that was ok bad area to find good associates though was there for6 years moved on.
good,"I applied for a security position and was assigned to the freight unloading team.   When I asked why, they acted like they didn't even know what I had applied for and didn't care."
good,I don’t get paid enough for what I deal with every shift. My store has bad management who will publicly humiliate you if you barely mess up and the HR lady is rude and not caring. This store causes more stress than its worth.
good,"My day consisted of being asked to load customers, being in multiple departments, back up cashiering, and making sure there were carts in the corals for customers. By myself mostly when it came to carts"
good,"Yearly reviews were always bad no matter how many times you make top sales employee. They would look over you and promote employees not qualified for department head and would expect those under them to train the new department head. If they wanted you gone, the manger would harass you until you would quit ."
good,"Home depot is not a great place to work, they hired me full time and killed my job 3 times. I had to fight to get a new spot in the store. When upper CEO's change the store they fire you and all in your job they removed. Then you have to fight to get a new open spot if there is one happens all the time."
good,"Everyday at work is stressful, there is little to no coverage in the heart of the store. Management does nothing as far as scheduling and hiring goes to have help all through the day at the service desk. This makes the associates look like they don't know what they are doing and upsets customers when they are in line for long periods of time waiting to do simple returns and other tasks."
good,"Really depends on who your assistant manager is. Don't get me wrong, good place to work but if your manager don't help when needed not worth it. All i can say is try it."
good,"Unless you kiss the butt of your manager she will ignore you and get you fired"
good,"Coworkers very gossiping. Managnent uncaring she liked certain people. Hard standing all day and winter it wS freezing with the doors open and"
good,"The base worker doesn't get paid enough considering this is a multi-billion dollar profit company. Those in the trenches are paid poorly and do the leg work to get the sales-without the interaction between those on the sales floor and the customer....the sales would be less, which leads to less profitability. Pay needs to be increased."
good,The notion of you tell us your availability for work  is a joke. Not necessarily accommodating or flexible. Part-timers work 95% of all weekends in the month.
good,"The company itself was good! I learned a lot, and got to move around to different departments furthering my knowledge and other skills. The management was pretty bad and unfair to anyone who had not been there for 5+ years."
good,Home Depot offers great benefits but don’t pay too well other than that it’s a decent job for young adults who have no work experience. I have nothing left to say.
good,"If you're looking to gain experience, this is your first job, or just want some income then this job may work for you.  Depending on which store you apply for and what department you get you'll stay busy most of the day.  Depending on the staffing they have at the time you may not have much help when you're first learning."
good,Wonderful working at home depot customers are very aggressive and intolerant sometimes they made frivolous wild allegations that may associates in jeopardy and that's not good given that associates are underpressure to render good and quality customer service
good,Store associates should be paid a lot more for what they do. Corporate associates get a lot more benefits than the store associates do so it's better to try to work there instead.
good,"I have worked at the Home Depot for at least 4 years and so far my time their has gotten worse recently than from when I first started. Freight team associates  barely make enough to have a sustainable income but some likely have secondary jobs. My current rate of pay is only thirteen dollars an hour which only came with my four year anniversary with the company. Pay increases take too long too achieve. The amount of heavy lifting and physical movement is not worth the meager pay that is given. Company benefits like medical, dental, paid expenses, and medication are ok but difficult to achieve through complicated paperwork. The Homer Fund is not a serious contribution to associates in need as it asks fellow working associates to contribute small but notable deductions out of their paychecks in order to help the affected when those working are not making enough for themselves as it is. The Set-schedule standards for deciding who works what shifts makes it difficult for any unexpected circumstances. Their is no compromises available for overnight third-shift workers in Freight as only way to have earlier hours is to work four hour part-time shifts which won't make enough with such little pay. The overall quantity of associates who work in my store is not enough to cover the amount of work required into physical departments like Freight or Lot as associates are stretched pretty thin."
good,"This job started out fairly okay. I had a good amount of hours as a seasonal. Aside from that I was taught everything I needed to know in a timely manner As it went on you were constantly pestered to learn forklift even though there is no pay benefit and you become a liability if you mess anything up at all. Management constantly shied away from hiring even part time employees because they didn't want to give them benefits. Rarely did they even higher on a seasonal for part time even, hence why I moved on."
good,treat you like a slave no discounts and pay was made up to make them more money  and they make up positions so they can pay you less i was considered over night sales associate but had to do freight work. and worked over nights place is a joke everyone quits fast there
good,"The job is not that bad but management for the m.e.t. team is just sad. Hard work is not rewarded only butt kissing and lazyness is. Most sales associates are never to be found. As a merchandiser you have to leave your work to help customers and your work is timed, makes job stressful."
good,This store within the past 2 months has lost quiet a lot of associates. That being said some major changes need to be made if the store wants more business
good,I do not have anything to report regarding my opinion of this company anything more than I've acknowledged. All answers have been provided accordingly.
good,You never know if theres gonna be enough coverage it's really hard to move up into a good position where the pay is fare you work long hours at minimum wage and you don't get a choice of hours that you can work it's really hard to have a home life and work at The Home Depot at the same time.  Depending on your position you have to tolerate in great customers obnoxious customers rude customers and management does not back you up. Most times they make you look stupid in front of the customer.
good,"Terrible pay can not live on it as a single income, management was great,  no overtime, wasn't there long enough to find out about sick pay vacation, there was no scheduled raises to my knowledge and they hate the umion"
good,The pay is so low that there's a cabinet in the break room for workers who can't afford food. That should tell you all you need to know. Millions in profits + workers who can't afford food = broken culture of greed.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work if you are looking for something temporary. There are no paid vacation or sick days, and there are no benefits. After a year of working there, you can look into purchasing Home Depot stock, but you have to work there for a while. There is something called the Homer Fund, which helps the employees that are dealing with tragedies in their lives. I think it's a great cause to help employees that have been loyal to the company for years. However, pay increases are not set, and when you do get a pay increase it is by cents. They make you work on holidays even though no one comes into the store. ""Career advancement"" doesn't really happen, either. I knew someone that worked there for 11 years and was still a cashier. Overall, not a bad company to work for but definitely don't have high hopes of moving up anytime soon."
good,"Nice place to work at, flexible work schedule, great customers, and advancement is always an option. Tuition assistance is available as well, and benefits are great."
good,"Its a good job, that pays employees money.  willing to reduce hours if needed for education. The greatest pro is that it helps pay the bills, much more than that is okay."
good,"Our store has been so understaffed for more than 6 months now, firing people for ridiculous reasons, and management seems to trap certain people in their departments by giving them finals. (you can't transfer departments when you have ANY type of final)"
good,"Home depot is a revolving door, the start pay is somewhat around 10-11 without any raises or meeting a lowes pay etc. There is some benefit some fellow associates make it worth it however the rest make it unbearable. Management is very much a false front; I.E: explain a problem ask for help, come back a month later no changes no feedback."
good,"Associates frequently complain getting 10 hours one week and then 37 the next.  Speak-up clearly or they’ll schedule you until closing one night with a 6am opening the next morning.  Apart from that, it’s physically demanding, no breaks because that service desk is chaotic with no backup scheduled. Staffing is poorly designed.  When you need to call in, or call in late, no one answers their phone out of 5 different extensions.  Managers provide conflicting training, lots of video training, but there is no uniform hands on training, creating high stress environment in front of customers with managers arguing in front of them."
good,"THD helped me meet amazing and great people. I will miss the people but not the job. From working here I have noticed that Home Depot is not manage well. We cant keep enough staff at all, management is very hard to get ahold of unless you have the 2 amazing MOD's that are on top of their game. Very harsh environment. I always feel stressed or would get yelled at about not having things done on time. At times get in trouble for things I can't control. Not everyone is willing to help each other out but that's any job honestly. some days are better than others but not all. The customers are not always treated fairly and are not 100% helped out which is unacceptable. I wish working here was better but unfortunately is not. I have made new friends and honestly if they were not there still I would be gone as well. It's hard to speak to management since not all of them want to sit and listen to you. A lot of drama happens behind the scenes which I have witnessed become an issue with certain employees and they have either spoke up or left. Many of the new hires leave due to money and lack of support. It's a shame that my time here has becoming less and less amusing. I personally don't want to ever come back to work here after I leave this upcoming year due to personal reasons. But I have learned that it will be easier after working this job."
good,"Even though the Home Depot is a good company to work for,"
good,Great place to work and make friends. It really becomes a family but you also have managers/co-workers who pick favorites. Keeping to yourself and doing all your tasks will get you noticed for your accomplishments.
good,Honestly good for beginning especially if you have no responsibility except for 1 person but trying to make a living is hard and you can make more at a fast food restaurant.
good,It's all in what you make it.  Being good in your position sets you up to getting  cross training in different departments.   Which seems great if you get the pay.  The more you learn the further they will stretch you.
good,"At the start of the shift, you were to go to your department and your aisle and begin to clean up or fix up anything that needs to be fixed. and then you were to do returns anytime there were any. Also, the best part was just talking to and being around co-workers you could relate too. The hardest part was not knowing if you were going to be there working the next day or not because they were, what felt like, the mangers overusing their power."
good,You can really get sucked into the culture of The Home Depot. Not seeing the sun for hours under those lights is really hard but everyday is something different and I was happy for the opportunity to work. The people you work with really give excellent customer service and it makes you want to be better.
good,The culture at this establishment is not a family. The Home Depot it pretty much a favoritism hierarchy. You will not get a position they told you they would interview you for . They won’t even interview you if another associate they like wants that position. Hopefully there’s a change sometime soon.
good,"Management is terrible, lack of hours, can have up to 4-5 days off in all honesty its very stagnant can take forever to move up unless you are favored by management which is also a problem. Favoritism is a real big deal there! You have to beg your way to the top and even then its not a guarantee!"
good,"Good job, worked in the garden center with plants and was outside a lot.  I liked the early mornings and go off in the middle of the day. Immediate supervisor was great and worked with me a lot."
good,"the perfect place to work if you like working hands on. fast paced, knowledge based on tools and fixer upper projects. decent salary, flexible hours. working here will teach you all about tools and their functions as well as how they work."
good,Given a new position that requires extreme amounts of work for minimal pay. Manager is constantly criticizing instead of recognizing the efforts being done.
good,"Standard management, with favorites and giving benefits to some associates and not others. Not applicable to all stores  but home depot in windsor CA had extremely poor management and abused the system for favored workers."
good,"There is no sense of work life balance. Yes it is the same for most all retail jobs, but this company excels at using people up then spitting them out to the curb. They claim to be employee focused, but the salary gap between hourly and salaried management is beyond ridiculous. Employees who perform well during the year can expect to see annual pay raises of 17 to 31 cents an hour - this from a $100 billion corporation that claims to be employee focused. Favoritism is shown for anyone who bleeds orange, is a corporate puppet, hassles customer for credit, and doesn't dare to have any other job to pay their bills. Management expects 24/7 commitment and availability. Its a decent job as a stop gap, if you don't care, or if you are desperate."
good,Not stable with leads or income unless you are a store employee. Flawed systems and poor communication. Management is focused on social media but has lost track of their own agenda.
good,"2 hours unloading freight truck"
good,"I enjoy helping customers and like the Home Depot culture, but there is not much opportunity for advancement.  I feel the work I do isn't adequately compensated financially."
good,"I applied there, telling them they were my second job and they still gave me 35 hours a week after I repeatedly asked them for less. There was 0 time to socialize with coworkers and the stream of (rude) customers were constant. This job is a purgatory."
good,"The long time employees are very loyal and friendly. The seasonal workers lack experience, however training is always readily available. The amount of store waste was shocking, but since new management, it seems to be improving exponentially."
good,"what else do you say, you either have or haven't worked in retail and understand what I'm saying. That's it that's all. did enjoy dealing with new people every day"
good,"Each store is in ""competition"" with the region. This put a lot of pressure on the specialist. "
good,Overall experience with Home Depot was not that positive. Low wages and poor management made for very low morale on the sales floor. Store management was very poor.
good,"They say they promote a work life balance, but I ghave yet to see this, and they only grant us 4 hours of PTO a month to use which only results in half a day, and if you don not have PTO and you call of oh let say if you're sick and you call off for a day?? They will give you what is called an occurance for not having the time to cover your shift which is absolutely obsurd!!"
good,Management was awful and they set up employees for failure due to little training and no assistance. Turnover was horrible within management which made things inconsistent.
good,"All management really cares about is ""leads"", additional revenue gained from contractor-installed products. Each day starts with a management report on how much the store made yesterday, how much the store should make today, in what place the store is in compared with other Home Depots in the region, and how the sales associates should push for leads. Greedy attitude. No questions on returns, and NO loss prevention. The employee will lose their job if they try to stop ANY shoplifter. Poor inventory control, lost merchandise, misplaced merchandise in store. Blame falls on employee. Customer is left dissapointed. Management is disengaged. 95% of products are made outside the U.S. Management and long-term employee clique. Hard to tell who is in charge."
good,"I was fired due to ""not calling out of work"" for three days, when in reality I called the store every morning. No one answered neither did management when I directly pages them. The reason for my absence those three days were because of finals at school, I was part time. This mishap has happened to me before and I have witnesses that can confirm that this dilemma isn't made up. The management team didn't care to think that I was absent due to my schooling and saw it fit to just fire a part time college student who used this job as a source of income to pay for his studies."
good,It was ok to work for this place but management only cares about certain people. Favorites were promoted when they didn't deserve it. They only cared about certain people and forgot others who weren't the favorite.
good,"Water plants, lift mulch into peoples vehicles, customer service. must be willing to answer phone calls, locate items. help customers in different areas."
good,There really wasn’t any good thing low employment always by yourself. They didn’t really care how you worked you had to kiss butt n order to get promoted
good,"Unfair towards employees and could use better managers. learned to drive equipment like a reach, electric pallet jack, slip, already new how to drive a fork lift. Only enjoyable when I was by myself."
good,"Some lot loders get away by not doing there work, they don't come at all at times when customers need their help and I call for one. Management never gave any homer awards to any cashiers within there past 2 annual meetings..."
good,"I can not say it was all bad, but I worked in a store where the men ruled the roost. There were under qualified people making more money due, and it is known it was due to gender. I was often viewed as a supervisor, but when it came time to actually promote me they wouldn't because of my familial obligations which would have been lessened with a higher pay with increased responsibility. In the end I chose to leave because I was doing the job without the benefits."
good,"The people (co-workers) i worked with were extremely helpful, but management was lacking in professionalism and consistency."
good,"Wish they paid us at the same standard than below minimum wage. "
good,"Management SUCKS! The HR lady sucks, don't give you hours give you the minimum of 20 hours or less because of being part time and only give you hours when they low staffed and get mad when you tell them no you cant stay. The employees in each department talk smack  about one another and kee kee and laugh like everything peaches and cream. The MODS suck they only care about the customers when their in the wrong and give us a run for our money when we explain the situations. The job it self was good the contractors I enjoyed but management freaking sucks. Oh and you have the department supervisors who think they in charge IN CHARE like they the store manager when your getting paid the same wage like every other employee."
good,"Management is going under pretty hard, it's impossible to move up in the company unless you've been there more than 5-10 years. Upside is that everyone is ready to leave and knows the struggle of customer service."
good,I learned customer service. Management could of been better. Hardest part of the job was unloading the Christmas trees off the trucks and setting them up on the assigned area.
good,"Interaction with customers was always enjoyable. There was always high pressure on selling extended warranties and credit cards. I did pretty well on this however; if a cashier did not do well there picture was posted on a board toward the exit doors which showed flames which was insulting and"
good,"Great group of people! Management in my early time there was great and it eventually evolved to garbage. I should have filed an EOC complaint against the manager at my departure. I did file a complaint with the company which they brushed off."
good,"Mind numbing and poor advancement opportunities. Start off ant 5am going from aisle to aisle cleaning shelves and making sure prices are correct. Helping customers if they ask for it, but we are told ""dont go looking to help them, we are on a schedule""."
good,"Work environment is fair but managers needed to be held to higher standard. Fast paced environment, and a/c rarely worked. Working conditions would sometime be below standards"
good,"Home Depot didn't give percentage raises, rather five cent raises. No set schedule, only knew schedule one week out..had to request a weekend off at least 30 days in advance, and still not guaranteed. Always negative feed back, never good enough."
good,"Not enough people scheduled per shift for proper coverage or to provide good customer service. The cashiers take the brunt of the customer's frustration because of this. "
good,"The Company in whole is good. The have parties and try to treat employees, sometimes you get bonuses. The store I work at has terrible management. The General Manage is okay but the ASMs get on power trips."
good,"One thing I can say I learned a lot. I've meet a lot of great people. This company is about who you know. They strive to be the #1 in retail ,not when you fire all your seasoned associates to hire cheap young associates with no knowledge.  No job security, they use and abuse you. Get in learn and Get out."
good,"My job was a part-time cashier with no chances to advantage, I was transfered from Huntsville, Al, worked for the greatest Manager Lynda Ares to Tampa, Fl, never get a full time, even is a asked for it."
good,"Stressful work place. Mangers ask for updates every hour on the hour. Not worth the pay. Quick-paced environment which makes you days go by fast, but managers are often MIA when you need them."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on the time you came in. If you're a sales associate if you came in the morning a pack down list you would have to print out or one would be provided to you. And you would bring down product not on the shelves while also clearing any carts left overnight while also providing customer service. Midshift consists of customer service, returns and store maintenance and whatever tasks assigned to you by a supervisor or manager. Closing would ensure the same responsibilities of mid-shift but you would have to sweep and clean the department and log into the computer any broken or empty packages of merchandise. The workplace culture truly depends on the store they vary. "
good,There wasn’t any opportunity to joke around or even just have a normal conversation not work related. Everyone had to be serious. Head cashiers weren’t able to assist you when you needed it.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot I have no issues with the work I did or the company but the management at this store is horrible , I was struck by a car on the job in the parking area I asked for help from my manager to report this on an accident report as well as a police report she tried to convince me not to and never submitted the form wen completed. I feel that it is an unsafe environment"
good,"Home Depot spies on it's employees and does not have loss prevention people. Therefore, the sales associates are expected to prevent losses. Training is almost non-existent and management is oblivious."
good,The store I worked at was in the middle of a million dollar property neighborhood. Therefore the customers who came in were of affluent backgrounds and made sure the employees knew it.
good,While the Home Depot may have a great culture and in theory are great to work for they need to improve their store management on all levels. When I first got to my store it was a great place to work yet slowly with a number of changes in management it has fallen into a workplace filled with hostility that makes it extremely uncomfortable for a Christian to work at. With that said if they could improve and make it a more family and Christian friendly place it would be awesome.
good,I enjoy selling the Name Brand.  Customer's feel in the end they will be taken care of by a company that will be around for a long time. Unfortunately projects are managed from Atlanta for all jobs Nation wide.  That does not work well for communication with the Customer..
good,Only cares on making sales not people actually doing all the extra duties was great first three years when HE was in-house once they faded that out the whole company changed the raise became smaller the multi tasks began
good,"No actual room for moving up, very little opportunity for full time, any excuse to not give you hours or your review, for pay raises. The culture is not a happy one, very stressful. Gossip is common and vicious.  And they promise you can transfer from store to store...which turned out to be a lie. Very disappointed at my employment with this company."
good,"Home Depot is a very good company to work for but it is fast pace and high stress. they give you too much tasks and responsibilities for an 6 to 8 hour."
good,"I had worked there for six months when they announced they were looking for full time people.  I had mentioned my interest to the supervisor of my department and the Manager.  I was told that if I could make it a year they would allow me full time.  My year came and went and after repeated attempts to discuss full time I finally gave my two weeks notice to go work for a job that gave me full time and more money.  If you ask for full time and someone volunteers to go, shows you their dependability and loyalty you should make good on what you discussed or at least have some reason as to why you said that it would but did not work out."
good,Typical retail job.  Unpredictable hours make having a life outside of work difficult.  Pay is decent although not the best.  Management is usually pretty terrible at addressing individual concerns and are usually woefully unqualified.
good,"at first it was great, then as i moved-up, it began to be come a chore, lies and deception . why is it people find it easier to lie than tell people the truth."
good,Most of employees expense more time talking each other instead of be ready to help customers. I learned that management promote people with out experience and knowledge. Management crew is deplorable. Employees are willing to be prompt to make gossip.
good,Home depot doesn't offer any opportunities for growth. The pay is very low for the work asked. However thy offer great benefits and lots of team building activities.
good,"The job its self is not too bad.  The pay is good compared to other retail stores and while i was there the schedule was not a problem.  later the scheduling policies became ridiculous and only favorites got the shift they wanted.  And at least in the store i worked at, management was ridiculously involved personally with the staff."
good,There is a lot of favoritism. Hardly any raised and if there are raises it's no more than 25 cents. Management is poor. They do work well with students though.
good,I seen people come in and make full time less than 90 days while others been part time for years. fun workplace don't get me wrong great co workers everyone needs to be included
good,"Nothing to really say about home depot , I would never work there again ever in my life, management is terrible as well as the corporate office they don't care about you"
good,worked seven days a week and late into the evening every night. Worked in the field all day and did paperwork all night. Training hours that are required are not on par with workload
good,"You were only promoted if HR liked you personally, they did not want to be flexible with 1hr (coming in later or getting off early) when it came to availability. Management often went against cashiers making us look incompetent even after we were told to say things that we said (ex: we no longer offer 5% Lowe's match)"
good,The Home Depot has great employees as long as you're not working for them or them working for you. There is a huge social problem here between management and employees agreeing and getting along.
good,Management was very poor. There was an environment of managing by the numbers with a complete lack of personnel (people)management. Favoritism was evident when it came to promotions and work hours. Managers were to close to employees (from the same town) to be objective. Never received any formal evaluations or feedback. The hours were never consistent and the pay was not commensurate with the responsibilities.
good,The staff I worked with in my department was well organized and trained new people well. Max hrs you can get as a part-time employee is 20 hrs/wk but usually less. No set shifts or days off.
good,Very stressful place to work...and being a dept supervisor the pay really sucks. And there are times when you have up to 3 dept phones...I felt the stress role off the day I quit.
good,Home Depot relies heavily on algorithmic data and gossip with scheduling and managing employees. Raises are not commensurate with productivity and longevity is not considered.
good,on the daily basis of the job was very fast paced for stocking shelves order product build shipments transfer shipments and special orders for customers
good,I enjoyed being a cashier in lawn/garden on a nice summer day. Inside it was stuffy and very hot. No ac! Co-workers were nice and helpful with they could be. One week you would have 23-27 hours the next 10-13. Most cashiers do not get full time neither does store associates. I learned a lot of cool and new things.
good,"The poor management was the reason a lot of employees quit  their position, not enough hours seemed to be a big issue for several employees to contin."
good,I never felt like I got paid enough for what I did. The management was not very good and they didn't care about my scheduling needs. I would tell them I couldn't work so many hours but they would still schedule me a lot and they pretty much laughed in my face when I asked for a raise.
good,"Slow paced repetitive environment."
good,It's mainly about who you know in order to advance.  Been with the company 5 years and still I am not able to advance. They expect you to pickup the slack that the lazy workers do not want to do. But they do not hold anyone accountable.
good,Home Depot would be a great place to work if they had competitive salary and greet hours and more compassion for employees our Associates better benefits higher pay
good,"Management was a bit lazy. took the success of the store as their achievement.  when In actuality the area around the store had the perfect age home all built 8-15 years ago.  Hours where low always some weeks could be 0 hours other maybe 20. This was corporates doing not the stores management."
good,"You get 4hrs of sick time a month but you can only use sick time if you have a full shifts worth. "
good,The management doesn't care about you or anyone else there. They just want people who will give up all of their free time and get no benefits. However the normal employees are most of the time very nice. I am still friends with a couple of them and I only worked there for about 8 months.
good,"Clock in "
good,"it takes a lot to get fired and it is a fun place to work at; they are friendly, there is a lot of drama it is better for you to keep busies and keep to yourself."
good,"Worked at a great store in Portage, MI and a good store in Mishawaka IN until the final 6 months when a new ASM came on board. She destroyed the culture and the morality of the associates"
good,I was a supervisor and my workload was too much.  When I left they changed the structure so the departments that I was in charge of was changed to have two supervisors. I even had to take a two month leave due to the stress. My doctor was worried about my sanity
good,"Working at Ronnie’s Home Depot is good and their is nice but the boss I had, treated me like I was below the ocean. She yelled at me for helping a co-worker who was helping a customer and I got what she needed, then my boss yelled at me because I was interacting with another staff member?!"
good,"It is very stressful, the way the managers run the store it is full of favoritism and sadly sexism. I get paid pretty good for a part time cashier but I have been harassed and no one will help put an end to the situation I am in."
good,You wont advance unless you are hispanic. Management informs you to do something then stands by and says nothing while you get yelled at by thier superior.
good,They have been through several CEO's.  They remain consistent with the 'retail' business plan while changing with the times through apps and online shopping.
good,"Your experience will very greatly depending on which store and store manager you work for. Some are understanding and fair and others are much less so. That includes the other employees. "
good,"i would not send my wrost enemy to work there if you have no resp[ect or pride this is the place to work.you are scum when you work there,you are usless to them only an end to there means"
good,"Slow pace"
good,"Good people that work there, management has no communication skills. To many Managers advising what you should do during your work shift.  Pull people from your dept to work in other departments that are short handed which make your dept lack and things don't get done"
good,"Worked hard for no rewards. Low pay, and only 2% raises annually. No raises for going over and beyond or for long term employment. Management ""buddy up"" with their favorite employees. Saw many people fired for breaking ""corporate policy"" without first giving warning of what they were doing wrong. Great PT job for a student, but wouldn't plan on any type of future with the company."
good,"HDE is an offset of Home Depot that doesn’t follow the value wheel that corporate has set in place. Management picks favorites, you are moved around constantly, work-life balance is non existent, 2 hours of PTO for part-time and 4 hours for full time every month. If you have a family, kids or if you ever plan on going to the doctor, don’t work here it’s an absolute pain in the butt and most managers will not work with you. You get occurrences for every infraction; minor ones are .5 and major ones 1 point. After 3 point you get a coaching, counseling and then final. They do not care about the well being of the associates and the place is a call center so be prepared for upset customers the majority of the time."
good,"The loss prevention people were never there, it was unsafe at time because a lot of crazy people would come in and steal and the mangers would make us talk to them"
good,"Pros: Found Home Depot employees hard working good people.  Liked job as Kitchen Designer.  Cons: Management is terrible.  15+/daily hours required of managers on shift result in stressed, irritable and unreasonable people.  6am required meetings regardless if day off or worked until midnight night before terrible practice."
good,When you're expected to squeeze the juice out of a lemon you squeezed three days ago it gets frustrating. I worked in Garden department and often closed what was effectively alone as coworkers would refuse to do more than the bare minimum. I did my work despite the imbalance because it needed to be done.
good,"The only reason why i came to this job from monday-friday 10pm to 6am is because of the people... honestly, management is always trying to find something on you. I was one of there fastest/best workers and they just take advantage of it. They squeeze it out of you like you were the last toothpaste in the world. Very cut throat, only way up it seems is by getting others in trouble to show your doing your job. The Day shifts i know nothing about but the night crew went through a tough change while i was there. Started off simple and do-able but ended up more politically difficult then the job was worth."
good,Lack of communication between managers and staff as well as lack of communication between same department members. the job itself is not difficult. the culture is very diverse there is not discrimination at all for anything.
good,Like with every job some are good and others are bad. The thing I feelt that needed to be addressed is the pay. For puller team you only get $10 an hour and the job is extremely physical and hard on the body. They need to raise this a bit more. The environment and management are amazing to work with and always help balance out the stressful days.
good,Customer service training was good. Support was weak when it came to employees. Favoritism was high. Must work weekends no matter what. Hard to get time off even when requested in advance. Inconsistant among all managers in every department.
good,The company is very metrics oriented and focused on the bottom line. This causes a lot of constant change on a weekly basis with people chasing down answers to which are not needed.
good,"Some of the managers should not be working there, definitely not as a manager. Best part of the night/day is getting off work away from the managers.."
good,"Working with this company was really great in the beginning, but new management, and the lack of concern for the employees well being caused lots of internal issues. Safety regulations were repeatedly ignore, resulting in multiple injuries for some employees."
good,"They take advantage of the hard workers, let everyone else slack off and then give the hard workers a hard time when they want a raise because they're doing their managers job."
good,Managers like to play favorites. Hard workers are rarely noticed or rewarded for their efforts. Most Coworkers act like children. Its difficult to get a full time position unless you are a kiss up.
good,"I don't recommend working at home depot. The work life balance is non existent, the time of day for shift scheduling is sporadic. Compensation across the board is unfair"
good,they make the setting a great place to work by conducting events for their employees. how ever when transitioning store supervisors they do a horrible job
good,stressful and inadequate shift.Stuck with same department making it difficult to do easier job sometimes.Some people enjoy the easy part while some are drained working.A lot of inbalance in job assignment.
good,"Long hours and moving shifts make it impossible to balance family life and work. This retailer is not innovative and tends to copy/steal what works well for others. They try to foster a values based company but nobody dresses you down on Monday morning over ""values"". It's a metrics based business; working in a smaller market disadvantages your career compared to those in a larger/hotter market."
good,Home Depot was face-paced and poorly managed. This particular Home Depot did alot of finger pointing on the management team. When someone did know something they would throw an associate under the bus.
good,"Everyone is replaceable. THD used to be a company that cared about their employee. Now its laden with corporate politics and has become complacent and focused solely on profits and no longer about the employee like they used to care for. It has turned out to be a complete waste of time and energy for a company that regards their employees as #'s and 100% replaceable regardless of training, tenure or usefulness to the company."
good,"el trabajo en cuanto a carga laboral creo que era equitativo,en cuanto a sueldo no muy bueno,en cuanto a los compañeros no se puede decir que hay convivencia la parte mas dificil la falta de apoyo lo que mas me gusto el poder ayudar a los clientes a cubrir sus necesidades"
good,"Went through quite a few managers and some of them sucked. Basic retail job, got moved around too much. Took experts out of their departments and put them in areas they had no interest in."
good,This used to be a fun place to work. Now its all about the bottom line and profit for them not about the customer or the employee. they do not care about anyone but the bottom line
good,"Management was terrible, showed a lot of favoritism and was not fair to most of the employees.  Never got many good words, was always about sell, sell, sell, the company seemed to be a good company, just not the local management!"
good,I have been in a smaller store for a few yrs now and it runs differant then the other stores I have worked in. Most things here are kinda clucky but most are hard working and intelligent.
good,"Management is just awful. Poor scheduling and unfair workloads. They dont run the store how they should year round, so when we have higher ups coming, the managers dump their entire workloads on the associates."
good,Every shift has different rules. They claim they have values but do not actually follow them unless they feel convenient. Overall management is poor and so is the culture. They say how much the company is making while barely giving any of that back to the employees. Poor morale. They can't keep any shift fully staffed and are constantly behind. They also have no standard of evaluating that is fair to the employee or properly evaluates the employee.
good,Over all this was a tough job that required a lot of physical effort and when I did try to advance I got stuck where I was when I started. I had a hard time with my management and how I was treated. Would not recommend.
good,I did work that was way beyond my pay grade and worked off the clock many times. Supervisors did not often care about the workers and there was little support from management
good,Management change every often. Bad culture in the workplace where everyone just wanted their shift to be over. There was no sense of community. There were many bad customers at home depot
good,"Accelerated work pace, many customers for a single employee,"
good,"It  is an alright place to work most of the people  are nice. They put you on the floor with little  training and don't schedule enough people to work  so it can get overwhelming  when you dont have anyone to  get information for the customers. Hard to get  full time hours , no benefits and  low wages."
good,"I work for the merchandising team and the best part of the job is the consistent hours Monday through Friday and in a retail environment such as Home Depot, that is amazing to have set schedule to plan your day around."
good,I enjoyed working with my Co-workers. I didn't appreciate the management there. They were not very considerate of the rules themselves. I had an incident with the Assistant Store Manager one day when he almost hit me with the fork lift. He was talking on the phone while operating it. This was the last act of carelessness I witnessed before I left. I like the core values of The Home Depot. It's just that a few of the managers at the location I was working at did not care very much about safety or rules. This is why that location got new management right after I left. The store was in bad shape. I did learn a lot about Freight and working as a team with my co-workers though. We had a great time working hard lifting merchandise and equipment together. I still keep in touch with a couple of the guys. There is nothing greater than a positive  and constructive work relationship.
good,"My coworkers are not as hard a worker as I am, and they would get credit for doing nothing, and I would get no credit for doing all the work. I would get yelled at if I stopped for a minute, but nobody else would get yelled at for standing around all the time."
good,"A very decent job to work, minus the incompantant managment staff and the poor pay with very low pay raise. I would recomend this as a part time job for students, not if you are trying to make a living."
good,"The Home Depot is an excellent first job, they will teach you to use a forklift and get certify if needed. Benefits are excellent by only to those who are full time which is very rare since they don't hire much full time employees in order to no give benefits."
good,"THD was good to me, though I think leadership can be MUCH more selective. I understand this is a company/business however, selected leaders have no empathy with their associates. THD glorifies valuing customers AND their associates. I genuinely feel like THD treats the associates as numbers rather than people with lives outside of work. Unless you are doing something to benefit the company/business, your concerns do not matter."
good,Great experience learning about shipping and furthering my experience in data entry and privacy of customer information.   SOlving problems and dealing with difficult situations.
good,"I know I wouldn't be a manager/supervisor within this company, offered very little support without much personal time, i.e. higher ups asking you to come to meetings and take conference calls even while on vacation! Market supervisor role is way more headache than anything no real training, you just kind of learn on your own as you go, and of course compensation is just NOT worth the headache. Corporate is of course always ever-changing, you do get some support from the higher up management, but you will also find lower management making things up as they go, to hopefully patch a problem. Overall I would say the measure tech job is okay you do use your own personal vehicle for the job, poor compensation for the mileage and abuse to your vehicle. You do get some flexibility with your schedule. As a measure tech is kind of nice because you don't have a boss on your shoulder all day, but you never know where you will be from one day to the next."
good,"Working at the Home Depot, at first, seemed exciting. After some time, however, the management began being rude. Part-time associates have no benefits, and management does not care about your health or limits."
good,your hours will be cut but on the positive side everyone was friendly.. flexible scheduling available and you get 6 points a year to work with if you need to be absent or running behind. the manager was awesome however some of the employees not so great...
good,management takes advantage of hard workers and dosent reward them enough for being the hard workers. other than that customers are really nice and employees are easy going so it balanced itself out
good,"management unfair "
good,They were willing to train you anywhere you wanted to be at. The pay was okay and the work was easy. The environment was very fast and made the day go faster.
good,"liked working with customers and working orderings parts, stocking shelves, unloading trucks and placing new product on shelves in the store."
good,"Working for the Home Depot company was a joy, to be part of a company with such longevity of years run. However, the discrimination, and manipulation as well as intimidation of the supervisor is and/or was too much to bear for anyone looking to reach goals on a personal level or within the company. The culture of the job were employee records, yet the stress of having to recover prior years of work that should have already been processed took a strong toll on many members of the team which caused reports of complaints. The nature of the job was not what was described as in the job identification, but the work was unbearable only due to the quota the heinous supervisor demanded. If there were another position within the building of corporate, I would apply in hopes to avoid the migraine."
good,Home Depot isn't a good place to raise a family off of. The hours are your typical retail schedules. I would recommend for college students. I had fun there while it lasted.
good,"Management is content to be kept in the dark regarding employee complaints, but let a couple of people make calls to the company because they didn't like something and you get fired. Management doesn't stand behind the employees unless you are one of the brown-nosers in their hind pocket, then it doesn't matter what you do."
good,Hope you never plan on having a car or moving out of your parents house. Minimum wage no benefits. Even if you do some how get full time you won't make more then the poverty level for about 5 years.
good,Worked third shift unloading trailer then stocking the store shelves. I learned the HD receiving system and all the paperwork involved. Hardest part of the job was unloading a packed trailer in a very short time frame.The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done early.
good,"Poor work conditions, few benefits and a culture of customer comes first no matter how badly they treat you as an associate. People to work with are good but management has issues about how they treat associates."
good,"management are able to blachlist,hold back employees, there is a employee advocate service but that doesnt help because managers lie and falsify info"
good,Great company but there are not many opportunities for advancement. The company invests very little into technology and innovation. There's a lot of room for process Improvement and the way things are done but there's very little discussion regarding that. Overall the company is too resistant to change that will inevitably happen.
good,"Because of my job title, I do not wear an apron (PICKER) not customer service. I have too many orders to pick to be interrupted every minute of the day by customers."
good,The anderson location seems determined to give accolades to the lazy favorite employees while burning out the hard working employees. Coverage is very low as store manager seems determined to run on a skeleton crew. Advance opportunities seem only available for the brown noses. Would not recommend working for home depot unless you are just looking to kill time with low pay checks.
good,"The company doesn't compensate it's long term veteran associates with a pay rate that meets the cost of standard living.  The Home Depot expects grueling physical work at a ridiculously cheap price.  It's also a very unsafe place to work, and it really doesn't promote confidence in anyone wanting to make a career with the company."
good,"Management is the poorest of any place I have ever worked; however, I do enjoy being a cashier and meeting new people, "
good,"I worked at Depot for years. was a supervisor when I left the Depot. A typical day was making sure sales plan was reached, hit all metric required for the week. Enjoyed my job but did not enjoy the pay."
good,Learned about different home projects and how to do them. Co-workers were friendly while management pushed for results/seemingly were unaware of how the employees operated in store during work (disconnect b/w sales floor associates and mgmt)
good,I've always love Home Depot and always thought it'd be an awesome place to work! I loved working nights in the garden center but couldn't survive on 32 hours at $8.00 an hour every 2 weeks. I'd still be there if they paid even close to a competitive wage.
good,typical day was to ring up customers. And stand by the register if no customers where there. not much else to do.
good,"Home Depot is a busy retail hardware warehouse store with good prices and a huge selection of merchandise.  I understand that this used to be a good place to work, until maybe 2007 or 2008 when the original company was bought out.  Home Depot no longer hires experienced people to assist customers, nor do they pay enough for experienced people to take this job or to stay there, so only a few old-timers are left who can actually help customers find what they need.  The others have had to leave in order to earn a living.  A lot of your co-workers there are good people, and fun to work with.  The rest are almost completely useless."
good,first off you will be paid biweekly and you will be chosen to work where is avaible and you be working late a lot they will send you home out of no where and you have to sell or promote products or credit cards etc
good,Management was poor. did not care for my scheduling problems and gave me extra hours in which i could not perform. Very busy all night with boss yelling at all of us often.
good,They do work with your hours however when asking for days off be careful because they take you off the schedule all that week. Then they try to work you every weekend instead of rotating people for non burnout.
good,"Was not  good fit for me."
good,"Management kept store under employed so as to accumulate more compensation for themselves.  Part time employees were treated like step children, sent home early or kept their hours at less than 28 hours per week regardless of how busy the store was.  Customers often complained about less than adequate help."
good,"It was an ok place to work , to much drama between management and employees. a lot of favoritism with management and certain employees ."
good,I did not like working there the management was horrible and the pay was not a living wage. They promote the wrong people instead of the people who deserve to be promoted
good,"Check/reply to company issued email, follow up on quote(s), inform customers of any issues with their order and/or resolve issues for customers. Organize files, relay docs via phone, fax, email or USPS. "
good,It was a good temp job until something better came along.It has to revamp the salary scale to stop going through tons of people.
good,"The position was simple and not too arduous; however, management talked down to employees and were not readily available when needed. At this location, professionalism was not a top priority from the top down."
good,good training awesome team leaders and co workers poor hours not enough breaks do to it is mentally straining work not enough pay . If you have time and you are looking for other job. This is the best place part timers.
good,"ABOUT ME."
good,I worked with very good people while at the Home Depot. The management tried but wasn't the best. It is very hard to cover more than one department at once. Many times I was overwhelmed with trying to help many people at once all over the store because of the lack of other employees on the floor.
good,My job was to assist customers in selecting and evaluating products.  I also helped move products around the sales area for placement purposes.  I have over 10 years of experience in this type os lumber sales work.
good,Loved the great opportunities to help customers on a daily basis. I also enjoyed using compassion and empowerment to help my fellow employees. There was great opportunities to be creative and trying to increase sales.
good,Large amount of DIY/home improvement customers. Management focus  mainly on sales and lacked associate concern. Co-worker team is a community but a small amount of focused on customer service.
good,"Great people to work with. Not too easy to climb the corporate ladder but plenty of ways to gain necessary experience. Although the pay isn't that great, you learn a lot of great experiences in different areas to help you along your career journey."
good,"great customers, but employee & peers were questionable. they would have some cool and easy to work with employees, but due to the area, you sometimes had racist customers/employees"
good,I have worked here for three and a half years. This company is a joke when they say they care about there associates. Wal-mart almost looks like a better company to work for.
good,"The company is fine and they really encourage a 'pro depot' lifestyle among the associates, however, advancement is slow and the pay is very low."
good,"The home office must review the individual Billy, He is the unfair person that is responsible for the mismanagemnet of policies and personel. But I had been an employee for three and a half yesr, loved helping people, and working with a team."
good,Bad upper management just worried more about the bottom line and their bonus than the people who made and help them to achieve it.
good,"Constantly given more work responsibilities and expectations with no added incentive. Pay increases are pennies and are only given once per year."
good,"I typical day at work depended on how busy we were. it could be a very busy too to slow to getting a lot of stuff to help store aparince"
good,I enjoyed a few of my coworkers. Manager had selective people that they catered to. Felt like I was in high school all over again. The pay is HORRIBLE!!! I don't see how anyone could stay there for so many years.
good,"setting registers"
good,Home Depot is a good place for someone who is interested in a fast work environment. You must have excellent customer service skills to work in a place like this. it is a demanding on your feet kind of job.
good,"There is always work to be done. i learned my construction techiniques. my co-workers were very proffesional. The hardest thing was, less salary and a lot of work."
good,Management cares less about you most of the time its all work and there is plenty of it to go around. My whole time working here we was always understaffed and over worked and underpaid. Great for students thats why I worked here and didn't mind. The work is pretty easy just need to get use to looking at labels all day and putting things in the right spot and have lots of patients with other employees mistakes and must have a positive attitude everyday to get by. Kind of scary if your not a top performer and get things right away because this company does have a high turnover rate. Working nights wont benefit much in pay because they usually start the day crew 50 cents more. wow right thought it was suppose to be the other way around. Anyways i didn't because i was a top performer and was about to get trained as a lead but the pay wasn't anything near what i wanted and i just finished with my certificate and was already in the process of getting another job.
good,"I really enjoyed helping people and the people I worked with. Unfortunately, the work/life balance was difficult and the company offered very little opportunity to advance for most employees."
good,Learned that Home Depot has a lot of training. Management is ok but not very involved if you work overnight. Job is pretty easy but does not pay well. Surrounded by good people who embrace a great company culture.
good,"Home Depot is not the worst retail venue to work for, neither is it the best. The corporate view is that they take care of their associates but this is not always true. The co-workers make it worthwhile to stay."
good,"A typical day at home depot as a cashier consisted of a lot of standing and dealing with very belligerent customers. the management really isn't all that great they truly want you to go above and beyond a ridiculous standard they do not adhere to and more often than not they do not have your back."
good,"Store level management does everything according to a script faxed to them from corporate management. Store managers take very little time to supervise, so those who do not carry their own weight get a free pass, and those who work hard do not get recognized."
good,"When I first worked at The Home Depot it was fun and interesting and had a wide variety of customers, but as the months went by I quickly realized that there was no room for advancement and it was tough to get a raise. Management at that location were not that great I had a DH who was drunk 99% of the time, you could smell the alcohol from his breath when ever he approached me and I was surprised that he never got fired, only until the new store manager came was when he got fired. After nearing my 1 year there I decided that I needed to leave because management was so bad, other than that I built really great customer relationships with the regulars. The hardest part of the job was there were no sense of direction, you pretty much do the same thing over and over again and even when you did the right thing no one nearly recognized the hard work you put into it. I wouldn't judge working at The Home Depot based off my review just because I might have had a bad store."
good,"Hardest part of the job was getting the job done on a daily basis."
good,A fortune 500 company hires more part time associates than full time only to give part timers few hours with low pay causing a high turn over rate which requires full time associates to work double time have to learn several different jobs to cover for short staffed departments with out any pay increase for the additional skills learned
good,A very good job to have downside was it was a big company with a lot of workers sometimes you can go unnotice
good,Typical day includes stocking. aisle maintenance.  Customer service.  On occations a Do it Yourself class on simple electrical projects.
good,"Come to work check department for any safety issues and correct them if possible or come up with a solution to correct them. Ensure appearance of the store isn't cluttered, check stock on product of when it last came in if not on shelf and when it will be in. If received stock on shelf and excess above the area on  shelf.  Ensure associates are engaged with helping customers, answer MOD(Manager On Duty) issues, check completeness and merchandising work lists assigned to associate. I've learned to read the different reports and if any specific product is making money or not, if it's doing better than last year, and if not what steps I can take find out why and how to improve on it. All management has their own style.  My co-workers will pull together to complete the job. The hardest part of my job is trying to make everything perfect all the time. The most enjoyable part is to see an associate progressively change into an outstanding leader and knowing I had a part in that."
good,"Having rebuilt kitchens for over 20 years--I couldn,t wrap my head around the price of resurfacing cabinets.  The lead program was geared to low income immigrants.  Having extensive successful sales"
good,"The corporate culture at THD is work, work, work and very little play. I spend 10-15 hours a day at my desk analyzing data and looking at Excel spreadsheets and Access databases. If I have time to take a lunch break, it's a light day for me. The work never ends. There aren't enough hours in the day to get everything done. The hardest part of the job is completeing all of your tasks in a 24 hour work day. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving the office for the day."
good,Work life Balance is non existing at Home Depot for salary managers. Long hours and swing shift weekly make it hard to balance life and work.
good,heavy lifting but if youre not full time youre on call and have no work benefits
good,"if your not in inner circle forget about it, all opportunites goes to those in circle. asked management date off month ahead of sons competition to attend sons competition, was told  either work or go to event but if go event have no job. thats an easy decision. manager told me he dosnt attend kids events i told him that his decision."
good,"Poor management, environment not conductive to learning."
good,work is okay people are ok to work with if u are looking for a carrer this would not be the choice they do not like to promote from within
good,Messy management team.  Shows favoritism to certain employees.
good,"Training is lacking in that cashiers are not trained how to use inventory system full.  This however could be a site situation rather then a company problem.  Coworkers are dependable, management takes issues into consideration when preparing work schedule."
good,Love the job. It dosent pay enough for responsibilities. Pay is same as reg sales accociates.
good,"The Daily life at the Home Depot was high paced and I learned Management Skills to keep the Lot Clean. But I also learned that the Home Depot does not advancing people in certain areas such as the lot, and my Coworkers on the Lot constantly disappeared when the day got busy.  If you're looking for a job, I would honestly avoid the Home Depot unless you have no other choice."
good,"A typical day at work I just cashed people out."
good,working with over a thousand customers daily and managing over 30 associates daily
good,I am good with customer service .good dealing with customer
good,"i learned how to do customer service, my supervisor is the best, some managers are really bad in there, the most enjoyable part of my job is when i have to help the customers to look for something they need"
good,A typical day at work required lots of driving (personal vehicle without enough compensation). I spend my days dealing with customers in their homes drawing up floor plans.
good,"Customer Service # 1 priority. I learned retail is not for me. Management was a little hard to deal with, always to busy with other things. Love my co-workers and the hardest part of the job was trying to please all of the customer's. I like working with people."
good,"Worked at least 8 hours a day, carrying bags of soil, rocks, mulch to customer's cars. Helping customers with finding the right thing for their gardening needs. Stocking sleeves when not helping guest. The hardest part of the job was not having a set schedule."
good,"very hard to do your job, when your doing 5 jobs for someone else. The pay was not good at all, and there were too many people telling you what you had to do or what they wanted you to do. No hours in the winter, and summer they would have you work too hard which was impossible to keep up with the demand of everyone else."
good,I do not want to air laundry. Will discuss on face-to-face basis.
good,"Homedepot is a good career choice for someone looking to be in management, however if you have no foot in the door they do not pay well and treat you poorly."
good,"A day in the life of  a customer care supervisor at The Home Depot is always at an unpredictable fast paced, solve-as-you-go speed. Both customers and the needs of the business keep me on my feet. No matter what happens, the focus never diverts from going above and beyond for our customers, coaching, teaching and training my team and to be always ready to adjust to new directives coming down from senior leadership"
good,Uninspiring with less than adequate management. Some decent benefits but overall compensation is weak.
good,"In the Mornings I start off with cleaning up the desk area and then refill the front of the  desk with the daily merch. Do our safety check list. Then start the phone sales and cash transactions. It may be a steady flow of customers or it could be really slow. Most days its busy, our store does 78 Mil a year and we always beat our sales plans which is great as a store for the company."
good,"There is room for advancement at Home Depot if you are willing to play the game. Pay has gone down considerably in recent years. 20 years ago a cashiers starting pay was $10 per hour, now its minimum wage. The work is mostly about getting the manager his bonuses. Very little handed down to the employees."
good,"Lots of walking and standing.  Training not good, must be able to figure things out yourself.  Very hard to get a full time position.  Nice co-workers, interesting job."
good,"This company only wants part-timers so that they can send them home when ever they feel they do not need them for the day.  When you are a full time employ, they are always asking you if you want to go home early so they can save money on the payroll.  You also have to keep an eye on your hours because you can not go over 40 for the week.  The problem is that when your shift is over and walking to he time clock customers ask you for help and you have to help them and some time it takes time to get them what they want."
good,"Time was, home depot paid top dollar to their folks. things change. the name of the game at Home Depot now is ""See how hard we can work a minimum wage skeleton crew"" and man, they're good at that game."
good,it is a fun place to work. they don't like to work around full time employees schedules.
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers with their gardening and seasonal needs. The hardest part was being out in the weather at various times. I enjoyed a lot of my co-workers, there were some that made the job very enjoyable. The management I did not like because they were not approachable when I needed assistance for anything. Also if they did not like you the management would find a reason to have you let go from the company."
good,"Long work hours, dealing with people complaints all day long. OK pay, but can certainly do better."
good,"The Home Depot is a huge corporation, "
good,"lo tipico atencion al cliente "
good,There were times that are pleasant day specially if the customer gave good comments on your service. Usually most days are unpleasant during weekend when there's a huge customers bothering you.
good,hr start off great but after you become part time you get the axs 
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work. After getting a new District mgmt team, Home Depot loss sight of customer service and it became all about the numbers, along with terming older associates to bring new young people in."
good,All I can say it is a great place to work. But you have to get yourself up pretty high in this place to go anywhere or make enough that you can actually live on and management doesn't know if it is coming or going but overall most of the people are great to work with.
good,I clock in at midnight and go to my dept folder and get to my work list. See what was completed and what wasn't and also what was added if list is completed. pack out any and all empty spots with proper merchandise. Make sure counts are correct. drop freight and make dept grand opening ready . Make sure dept checklist is done and all pallets are off the floor and trash is in receiving
good,"management disorganize, cheap pay, hiring more people but cutting hours at the same time"
good,I worked over nights so i would never get any time to show how much of a value i was to the company.
good,"Home Depot is a good company overall, but, unfortunately, it depends on the store you work in."
good,The Home Depot has good values in theory but they do not always make it down to store level. There is not a good work / life balance and Advancement is very slow if at all. Management need more training in people skills.
good,"Most days are rather fast-paced. The managers aren't there to help, instead if you are having any kind of trouble, they will replace you."
good,"Sold Paint- talked to customers, learned about product, downstocked. Most co-workers were nice and friendly, and management left you alone for the most part unless something was wrong. Gossipy environment in the lunch room, but as for work it wasn't too bad. Enjoyed mixing the paint and altering colours, learned alot about it."
good,"I have enjoyed the past eleven years at The Home Depot. I had the opportunity to excell in customer service, as this comes very naturally to me. The experience that I brought to the job was not fully utilized however. The growth potential to management positions was something that I wanted early in the years, but as the culture and values seemed to change, I decided not to pursue promotion within the company."
good,I learned to excel at customer service and polish my cash handling skills. I loved the people I worked with but the management was less than favorable.
good,"Flexiable work schedule, active work enviornment. Co-workers are always ready to assist customer and each other."
good,"I do enjoy home depot, I love the managers but the deparment heads not so much most of them seem to have a chip on their sholder. It is hard to be able to get a second job because of the schedual never a set shift or the same days off. I think they could do a little better in training. I enjoy the co workers very much yes there is a issue all the time but just like family we always get through it. The job is only had when your schedualed by yourself for an hour in your department. but i love the job its great!"
good,A great place to work if you are young and low pay. When you get to top of pay range and older they find a reason to get rif of you.
good,"Lot of work no ben, and bad working hrs. Woork days verry open and close."
good,A typical day at work would be standing at the register and assisting customers in what they needed.
good,DC Area Supervisor is responsible for the success of assigned functions within a complex distribution center environment to ensure that it
good,"i hated working there. i was a cashier and they count it to the last penny, if you are short a penny they will write you up for it, stating that either if you are short u didnt care about the company loosing and if you were over that one penny than that ment you stole from the customer."
good,"I have worked for other home depots but this, in my opinion, was the worse one(Glendale area of Denver). The management curses in the store meetings, with other co workers, and the password is a curse word too! How unprofessional. The manager was great but his assistant managers were ""uneducated"" to put it nicely. The workers yell at each other when they can use the handheld phones. I believe they cut back on spending for necessary equipment/ladders, etc.. so the numbers will look so great on their reports. It's hard to do a job when you do not have working equipment."
good,A typical day consisted of friendly customers and coworkers. Management is respectful and friendly depending on their mood. The most difficult part of the job was managing the Service desk solo for many hours without additional coverage. I have worked there for 5 years and I have had many days where no one can cover my break or lunch and I am written up for going over my fifth hour or asked to take a short lunch. However the most enjoyable part is our annual Christmas party and kids workshop held Saturdays.
good,"Same as always, advancement is impossible if you don't belong to the boys club!"
good,"enjoing the company of customers and keeping the work environment clean at all times. Other representatives don't pick up the returns and the merchandise is blocking the area, making the store unsafe."
good,A place I wish I had never heard of. I caught many mistakes when auditing but was let get because I failed to catch one truck driver's mistake.
good,I waited on customers and bagged thier purchases I liked my managers and I also liked working with the public
good,"this isn't the most enjoyable job. I was promised pay raises and management positions and i was used,"
good,It's a great place if you are just starting to work. There were often times when you received so many different rules from so many different people that you forgot what was exactly right and wrong. It is a great place to learn how to multi-task.
good,"ware house enviorment,busy, lot of lifting, dusty."
good,"The Home Depot is re-energizing its customer service as a core value of the company. There is always work to do, and the hardest part of the job is balancing the tasks throughout the day vs delivering world class customer service."
good,Hard to advance in the company and management was harsh at times. Not a lot of slack when it comes to what is expected of the employee.
good,"They will fire you any chance they get. The managers are always on top of you, can't even move without them wanting to know what you were doing."
good,very busy and full of moves to be made on the go for the most part
good,"A typical day at work is always a learning experience. I have learned to do my own home repairs. It's a really good company to work for and watching it grow. Some people I work with are like family. The hardest part of my job is when asked to do a work list, but don't have the tools to do it with. I enjoy working in the Garden dept."
good,Going to work knowing that their is a job that needs to be done and to satisfy the customers no matter who we hurt.
good,"I have worked for a lot of companies large and small, many supervisors and many people I was in charge of the last 35 years. I have never met a more incompetent manager as the one at Home Depot in Champaign. She has no clue and a lot of good people have lost a job having her in charge of that store"
good,Hardworkers are taken advantage of. Lazy workers are given to much leniency. Managers are sparse when help is needed. Company phones are hard to come by making doing your job harder. Pay is to low for work required.
good,Demanding physically and stressful. To me I felt like a performance percentage not a tenured employee.. Upper management is great but supervisors can frequently and are hired without knowledge of the processes
good,"The company as a whole is a typical retailer. I worked for them for 14 years. Starting pay was $9.50/hr, when I left I was making $12.82. They company says the other benefits add to the income. I  just don't see how the price of gas goes up more than 10 cents a year but they'll only give you a 10 cent raise for the same year. Very hard to support yourself without having a second or third job."
good,"Dont trust anyone you work with, or a cut throat place. I was top sales person for 3 years running, and with some personal bull@%$t  lies, it was over."
good,"The home Depot has the potential of being a great place to work. However, those in charge are making the environment toxic. The company needs a major restructuring. There are nothing but tyrants, control freaks and emotionally unstable people in the positions of leadership over there. There's no job security, respect for diversity and freedom of expression."
good,It’s retail so if you want to be screamed at by customers over something out of your control be my guest. Pay is awful for a department manager. Management doesn’t care for anyone but themselves and their bonuses.
good,They are a good company as long as your on Time not late and they are strict when they have to be other then that they are a fun company to work for o
good,I enjoyed this as a part time job but pay is really limited and it’s annoying to have managers constantly push you to increase sales with no monetary incentive.
good,"Not a lifelong position."
good,80 percent of employees are part time. Can't make a living wage and schedules change weekly. You are given full time days with part time hours. Doesn't make sense working 5 days a week for 15 to 20 hours week. Wages are low.
good,"Overall, the job requires flexibility. The working surface is hard so you have to be prepared for that. You end up with individuals who are self-serving a lot so its hard to do your best some days but you try because it is a good place to be and those at your level will care for you."
good,"To start they are great, but the longer you're there the more they seem to stop caring. Small events for associates, however larger ones for upper management."
good,"The types of managers they have are very Jeckle and Hyde. They suck up to the customer and do absolutely nothing to help the employees. The only ones that move up are the ones that kiss butt. On top of that, one of the store managers was so unfair that HR needed to be called for him to understand the error in his leadership style, if you could even call it that. It is sad that a company with a good image is in truth just that, an a projected image of the way they want to be seen"
good,I would recommend this job to anyone starting to work. You will learn so much about tools and so on. Definitely a great work environment with great people
good,"high pace environment always changing schedules. never able to develop a routine. is fast, is demanding, but it can also be very rewarding. you get out of it what you put in."
good,I thought i would like it there but with the lack of good management it was not easy to work there. co works on there phones managers just not helpful
good,Total churn and burn environment unless you kiss butt. The work isnt hard but dealing with all the bad attitudes and the extreme heat in the summer is awful.
good,"If I could've finally gotten to be full-time, with benefits, staying at the Durham store would have been worth it. I loved being the go-to person to be the cashier in the garden center. There was rapport. People were good to each other."
good,I had a very bad experience working for Home Depo. My immediate supervisor had a bad temper and would cuss me out in front of other employees and customers. I had a hearing problem in my right ear. He would call me stupid among other vulgar words all the time. There was another lady who worked with me that cussed me out constantly in front of customers. She would cuss customers out alsoout als
good,"About 2 years working there, and I lived the job. Always had work to do, got called in, was even allowed to stay late and take shifts. Then the management changed and I was allowed hours one week, but had the same taken out of successful weeks. I was put on jobs that I could not do, was even told to work when my body was swollen and bleeding."
good,"Was excited to have gotten hired at Home Depot, but I felt there was a lot of favoritism. I felt I was not given a fair chance I  proving myself at assigned working area and felt was demoted to custodial position. Felt outcast and was walking on eggshells after company learned of my pregnancy. Doctor put me on bed rest and was terminated for it."
good,I was part of the Merchandising Execution Team which is a small group of employees that are in charge of organizing and stocking the shelves with merchandise.
good,"I worked for Home Depot for 10 years. I started in Boston, moved to Vermont and worked in Williston. I enjoyed both of those location. Boston was a good teaching store, and Vermont was a family store, meaning that there were many people who worked there who were related."
good,had fun and loved the actual job but the overall management of the company appears to be lacking. Soooo many miserable people working there - from my experience the job makes them miserable :(
good,"Great environment to work in, fast passed . Get the opportunity to move to different departments and learn new things plus also can move up quickly if you work hard. Pay is not so great for the work that’s required. Management plays favoritism all the time...."
good,"Unload a 1000+ freight truck with a short staff of 4 including supervisor , I learned just basic fundamentals such as the work phone , where stuff is in store & not much info of departments and items. hardest part of the job is lifting 50 + pound item consistently, most enjoyable part was clocking out to go home at 5:30am after an 8 hour understaffed shift of work."
good,Place was rough to work at no direction alway feel overwhelmed manager always played faviotes people got praised who didnt deserve it. Always short staffed never enough help from managers
good,"It’s ok, not awful or great. Mostly part-timers. Full time is difficult to obtain, even after proving your ethic. A few supervisors are nice, more are backstabbing and condescending. Managers will claim to have your best interests in mind, then push you into traffic to save themselves. Nearly all associates are great team workers. But there’s something about moving up in the company that sucks out their souls and makes them shady and secretive."
good,Good company bad management. Managers only last about 3 years and then they are gone to another store or job. Not paid enough for what they put on your plates as far as DH's.
good,You work here for the people you associate with and Costner’s that come in. The rest of the work gets confusing. I remember different mangers worked everyday and you had to undo or redo work just because someone didn’t like it. It felt like my time was not of any use to my mangers. You could put your heart into anything and half the management would praise you then the other half would scold you.
good,I found Home Depot to be an uncomfortable environment. It reminded me of junior high or high school mentality with leaders who struggled to engage or empower their employees.
good,"Feels like working with gossipy high schoolers and management (if you have a poor manager like I did once - once had a great one) will do nothing to change the dramatic environment you have to work in. "
good,Great and if you need to move up Asm and up is well paying for everyone else this is great if you need a second job and decent benefits just wish mangers were better trained and that pay was better for supervisor and lower minimum wage job NYC
good,"Good job for a teenager or a college student. They do offer a lot of advancements however you have to be apart of the crew. If they like you you get hours it’s hard to become full time unless you are friends with the department heads.On a good note,Alec is the new front end supervisor and he is very fair I do believe there will be a drastic change in how things are being run."
good,Good for a regular paycheck but advancement is difficult. Overall expect to be underpaid and encouraged to work long hours with several layers of supervision.
good,The is no work life balance.  You will work every holiday and have no time with you loved ones.  The pay was fair.. and the  benefits were good.. but the price was too high..
good,"Management is horrible "
good,"When you're hired it's all about the family. When you work there it's all about the company and how to make money for the company. They say it's about the customer, but it's all about the company."
good,"Whatever you do, don’t get sick. They are willing to train you, it’s a lot to take in. But if your in school make sure your clear about your hours. It’s fast paced."
good,"If you are a gay woman of color,  you might succeed, they will lie to you, you will make more money elsewhere.  They promote you if you are willing to take the job for the least amount of pay, Not because of your knowledge and experience."
good,I always showed up for my scheduled shift. I was nominated twice for perfect attendance. One of them for which was 1 full year of not missing one day. I excel above average in my daily duties.
good,"When it was busy hours and constant attention was needed for customers, the management staff would ask floor associates to do their busy work while they talk and relax in the break room. No one was on the same page and it made everyone's job harder and time-consuming."
good,"This coulda been a good job, overall the people and atmosphere aren't bad, but they don't pay very well and God forbid if you do a good job as a cashier and actually show up, well you wont get the chance to advance even if you should because everyone else up front is young and has a case of the brown bottle flu every weekend so because I was responsible and showed up, they kept me right where I was at instead of promoting me. so they need you where you are."
good,"I had some good experiences with some managers. However you have to really watch your own back, when I left there I made sure that every manager of the store including my supervisor and other associates in the kitchen and bath department know about my projects going on that will need to be followed up. However, not a single one even looked at them and in return blamed me for never letting them know. They then proceeded to black list me because it was easier to blame the one who quit than to accept that they lost over 100,000 dollars in sales due to their negligence."
good,"After working at Home Depot for many years, I quit Home Depot due to management scheduling me during school hours. I was forced upon a dilemma and I chose school over the Home Depot."
good,"It's a home improvement store, so there are going to be a lot of customers and questionable employees, but at the end of the day it's a paycheck. Easy to learn the job and hard to get fired."
good,"Not the most stress free environment.  It was very stressful and, the management staff was not very friendly, despite what the training videos claim.  The management staff were always on edge and made those under them suffer for the slightest mistake."
good,"Store connectivity was the name of the game here. The store is filled with awesome hard working and talented individuals, however the amount of over management outside of the store is ridiculous and in my opinion damaging to their brand. Their business model is now shifting more towards the internet, in the model of Amazon as an example, which was the cause of eliminating my entire division. Work/life balance and core values of the company were not realized concerning my expectations or their promise."
good,"The job ain't much the problem or the customers, it's management and the power tripping associates and the fact everyone is ""supervisor"" at store 0658"
good,Very laid back  come as you please easy part time job. Great for younger people and older people trying to make some extra cash on the side.  Flexible with schedule
good,"It’s a job. Everyone is disposable. A good way to get experience with all kinds of customers, coworkers, and management. Some department supervisors are trash, and some are good. Don’t expect to move or train in between departments, and don’t expect honesty from any management. Get job experience from here, and then move on to a better future."
good,"Work/Family issues, terrible scheduling, THD will cut hours in a heartbeat, rarely get two days off consecutively. Associates are friendly, nice place to make friends."
good,"Good starting job but was there for 2 years and could never advance even after proving to learn multiple different departments "
good,"I love my work family but management are very misdirected and mislead. Lots of favoritism and ""looking the other way"" for certain people. Hard workers are given harder task and driven more with less recognition then others who get awards and special recognition just for exsisting in the company."
good,"good place to work at"
good,"Would not recommend unless u looking for a place to waste time, because no full-time employment and no real part-time unless u consider 10 to 12 hrs. If u want more u can wait for a call when others call out or take someone else shift. When u sign in as part time of 20-25 and get 10-12 and some weeks nothing it’s a waste of time."
good,Managers were not understanding.  You come second. if you have long term health problems stay away.  Time & attendance is everything. Working hard will not get you a promotion.  It's based off of who you know.  If your a friend of manager then you get manager positions no matter if someone else who has been there is more qualified.
good,Hours never the same 2 days in a row. Might close then open the next day. Work every weekend. Had to be up management's butt to get advancement. No advancement.
good,"I could easily slam the working conditions at Home Depot but I  won't.  I will just say the retail life is not for me. I dont like standing on hard concrete all day, the constant change of your schedule and the favoritism that goes on."
good,No one ever Works 8-hour shifts except for the head cashiers if you do work at 8 hour shifts because you're picking up someone else's shift who didn't come in or because they need you to come in to take someone else's shift is usually four hours shift so you get about 16 maybe 20 hours a week unless you're picking up all the call out shift if you don't need that much money are you don't have many bills this is a great job but if you have a whole family your own place your own car and you're making payments when things you need more than the hours that they give being a cashier is the worst position in the store because you don't receive those hours but anything else in the store you do get your 40 hours
good,"Your yearly pay depends on your monetary review, basically you should be sucking up over here, company is good but their management and work ethics are really bad. Good job for retirement or when you are studying as their benefits is good."
good,"I started working as a Cashier,then promoted to work in Garden Department as Sales Associate,but the longer I worked there,I was no longer working on my job title as Sales Associate as is stated on my contract online, but instead everyday on every shift, I had to work watering the garden,we have no right to voice out I am not against of it,only there's no job advancement ,complaints explanations on side of the employees, and not to show up for work, that can cause us for immediate job termination,and also no job security, a lot of our coworkers were being fired /terminated for no valid reasons , we are all indespensable.The company almost hire everyday,and I had to fill in the place for my other coworkers in the self-checkout,register 6,pro desk or in customer service department if somebody had been fired,sick or don't show up ,I worked 2 shifts one very early in the morning and one in the afternoon,I felt so stressful,and our hard work had not been credited or compensated."
good,Only good for temporary or first time job. Management is terrible. Everyone is for themselves and quick to throw others under the bus. Only good thing is benefits
good,"Home Depot upper Management needs more training, especially on how to treat their employees. No one can live off of 16 hours or less. Get a clue Home Depot because you only pay a few dollars above minimum wages."
good,"The Home Depot is just another large corporation. If you have any experience with large retail chains, it pretty much the same. Hard physical work, low pay, little or no vacation."
good,Not terrible but they do not know how to be professional. They will change your schedule and all types of things and not inform you. Management is very funny acting and shows that they don’t want to be there.
good,"I felt as though it was too hard to advance in the company. I stayed there out of necessity the pay starts off very low and raises are minimal. Also, the managerial staff switches very often."
good,Ok place to work they nickel and dime you on raises you get two bonus checks a year but don’t expect a lot management get the big checks associates are  lucky if that get $100
good,This is not something you want to make a career out of if you ever wor retail you Know what your getting yourself in plus there is no discount great..
good,typical day at work would be good until customers would scream at you. I learned customer service/data entry/phone calls management wasn't to bad. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the diversity in the work place.
good,"I transferred stores; my initial store was a great place to work where managers presented opportunities for growth. They were supportive and encouraged employees to grow and develop within the company. For personal reasons, I had to change stores, and it was horrible. They only promote people of a certain race; I have had managers changed my reviews to thwart my growth and have no interest in developing associates. Honestly, it is a game of Russian Roulette."
good,Management is poor they have bad communication skills with each other and don't pay attention to their associates. Besides the management the coworkers there are very awesome and keep you motivated and wanting to come back.
good,"the managers were mean and expected too much. the work itself wasn't bad but they had me doing hard work to the point of running and sweating but the manager always said it wasn't good enough. So"
good,"It seems as if the employees don’t like each other , they all lack communication. Their is suspicious activity between some of the employees there that I find questionable."
good,"They could care less that you had small children, I was scheduled different hours. I had to find daycare and babysitters to accomadate my schedule. It was easy."
good,The store  I am currently at is a butt kiss fest in the way of upper management. I can truly say that there is only one who does their best. To look into situations that you are concerned about and tries to help correct it . It’s sad that people are promoted to Department Heads and he or she has no people skills .
good,"High work load, low compensation, and especially, random work schedule makes it difficult to maintain a good balance of life."
good,"The store manager and most people I worked with in general were amazing. A few bad apples, but the head supervisor (who will remain unnamed) had a sort of superiority complex and several other behavioral intricacies that slowly made for a more and more hostile and volatile workplace for some, while also just killing morale for most of my coworkers. Those who weren't affected were part of the problem."
good,"Low wage, hour cuts, no room for advancement (not even an opportunity). More people telling you what to do than actual workers. At the Merced, CA store there is not much diversity."
good,"Hired part time, however, was getting full time hours. Shortly hours were gradually cut. They would instead consistently call short notice, to have me cover for someone else."
good,"The place is great for paying at the bottom of the barrel. Which shows in their ability in keeping knowledgeable staff. Thank the web for doing your research before coming in because odds are great that you might end up with a orange apron that has to go and find someone else. "
good,"You're co-workers become family and are great people. So friendly and kind genuine people. But as soon as you get to know the hirer ups... let's just say they're not as friendly. The walk around on the sales floor most of the time like prison guards. They treat you like kids in high school. Moving up the ladder is non-existing even though they make it seem like you can. If you miss more than one day due to illness or family or anything serious even if you can prove it vi- doctor notes, family handwritten notes etc... On probation, they will talk to you like you're a kid and the second or third offence they put you on a suspension .... whatever that might be. Four or five days missed they will fire you it's fair but, remember even if you have proof they will still fire you. Now if you worked there for longer including years, they will discipline you until you're in tears no joke, I've seen many supervisors in tears because of it and even spoke with them, they sounded shaken up and scared. It's the customer-first oriented business which is how it should be but, It just hurts to see supervisors who are nice, caring, and loving people get treated like kids especially when their 30+ years old. No respect for the elderly."
good,"The product that was ultimately delivered to customers through Home Depot Exteriors was regularly disappointing.  This led to poor morale on the sales team, and ultimately a large scaling back of what was offered to customers leading to naive layoffs company wide.  The top-level management in this division is incompetent and does not have a clear distillation of what they want to provide to customers nor how to get there."
good,"The culture was upbeat. Fun, fast paced. Department Heads are over worked and barely meet deadlines. Poor training. Too much is thrown on the workers at the store level from corporate. Not enough managers to cover the front-end so DH's aren't doing multiple jobs at once. You will take work home as a DH."
good,It’s an okay job I work about 30 to 40 hours a week I think it could be a better job if everyone was on the same page. They expect a lot and it is a fast paced job
good,"I enjoyed my job at The Home Depot; however, I found it be rather ""political"" and cliquish.  They did allow me to stay in Hardware, which I am passionate about.  As my first management position, I could have used more training."
good,I would recommend this job for a young person as a summer job. people are very easy to work with and learn customer relations and work ethics. there are possible advancement opportunities as long as you are a full time employee.
good,Overall the people are good  and fun to work with. Management could do a little bit better job of communication there’s always some sort of confusion  on whos supposed to be doing what.   The pay and raise are not worth the work load they give you .  They tend to burn out all their good workers and still keep around the  people that are useless
good,The corporation had good ideas but because of the weakness of the management  it didn't really make it down to the sales staff.  Managers were still just retail management  without the initiative to  try to work outside the prescribed limitations.
good,"people are fun , management never listens to its employees. hours were never the same. some weeks 5 hours other weeks 20-30 hours. paid breaks no paid lunches"
good,"I do not wish to talk about my experience. I choose to decline to answer . But its is making me type something so, I just want to say I would never go back there again."
good,Management only cares about hitting sales numbers. Unrealistic expectations set on staff daily and very poor communication between management and direct staff supervisors.
good,"I was at Home Depot for over 10 years, and depending on where you get hired at, depends on what you'll get out of it. As the years went on, the quality in New hires and moral depleted. Transferring is super easy, which is a plus, but ive been to multipul states and environments, and at the end too many people where in higher management that did not know how to do there job, nor want to learn how to do it properly. It was a toxic environment with supervisors who constantly talked down and belittled their associates. You would get in trouble for helping a customer on the phone instead of a customer to showed up after the call started who was in the store, they would expect you to hang up mid conversation because of the 'image' it held even if you addressed the customer in line. The pay was Aweful, you normally make more at Starbucks than you would at HD and it would be a less stressful environment. After 10 years I decided to leave because I was done killing myself for basically minimum wage after they denied my request for a pay raise given my time and knowledge of over half of the departments in the store."
good,"i worked for the home depot for almost six years with no room for advancement,they would say everyone would be able to advance but that is simply not true,they only advance the people that sucked up to the management and they really do not like to give good rises. In my almost six years of working at the home depot i was only making 12 dollars an hour and they were hiring new people at the same rate as i was getting paid."
good,"I started working here at the age of 19 but this wasn't my first job. This review is based on my current experience at Costco and just simply comparing on how they treated us. "
good,Work is work at retail. There is a lot of young people there so there is always drama. As long as the drama is away from you then working here is fine.
good,"I think It may have just been my store, but the main manager over my area hated me for no reason, Both the day and night supervisors where amazing but the main manager over my area wouldn't let me eat a snack when it was slow, but everyone else was able too. I needed more hours so I would pick up shifts and I got told I would be fired if I continued doing that. They offer benefits but only for full time employees, which you have to be a manager or supervisor to get full time. It is really slow paced unless it is in the morning but that wasn't too bad."
good,"I have had some managers that cared, but by and large [especially ASMs Assistant Store Mangers except for a couple] did not care. There were many days/evenings where I was the only person covering Hardware, Plumbing, Electrical, Kitchen and Baths, Appliances, and Millwork departments, while being the, or one of the very few trained lift equipment operators.  That upset many customers.  Managers bonuses are based on employee hours, so they cut hours where ever they could. There were many tasks which were also assigned in addition to customer service."
good,Working for home depot is ok if your looking for a retirement job. Even with the pay raises your only allowed up to 50 cents if they even give you that.
good,"Customer service but when it comes down to it if you aren’t brown nosing, you don’t get far. Attempted to move up but management hires outside before within. Low pay. No help, management is very demanding. Not very supportive"
good,"Your day is busy helping customers, some of whom are contractors.  You are expected to know where just about everything is in the store.  However, there is usually someone around to help you."
good,"Bad work environnement, the management doesn't care about you, the salary is next to nothing, and the schedule they give you is so bad that you have to get up in the middle of the night to go work for 4 hours."
good,While I worked there anytime I applied for a day off or needed time off for school I was denied. The management was very difficult to work with at the store I was currently at as well. There was not much support from my fellow associates from the beginning so working there I felt that I could only rely on myself to grow.
good,The work envoirnment is quick and you learn a lot. Customers are generally nice but the contractors can get a little mean. I liked my store but my supervisor pushed me to my break but before that it was enjoyable.
good,there are words in here. It was a bad place to work at. Any way for them to cut cost they did. they fired someone who had work for them for 10 years and fired him over a mistake that was over 2 years ago.
good,"As a sales associate for The Home Depot for the last 3 1/2 years I have had good experiences working for this organization. "
good,Home Depot hires for spring then all temp hires are let go. The corporation is always balancing pt verses full time. Very few pt will make it into full time positions.
good,"poor local store manager.  Had a performance review, was told I was getting a raise and how much. Came back from vacation, and they said they changed their mind. I asked them to contact me in 2 days "
good,The workplace is good but sometimes management makes poor decisions like who to hire (physically wise since it is a heavy lifting store) and schedule plannification as well causing us to be short staffed so as to not go over hours on their weekly plans
good,"Working at The Home Depot was an interesting experience. The job is an easy one for the most part, helping customers and dealing with product. The problem I and many of my peers encountered is that management never had any clear communication with the rest of the store. No one really knew what was going on with the company outside the store. The worst problem though is that of moving up in the company. Management moves associates around like it is nothing, no role is safe in store. I had my limit after working for the company for 2 years and then they moved my position to one where I was making less than brand new associates I was expected to train. Moves like this and undertable plays to cut wages and hours were far too common for a company that tried so hard to preach a caring environment for employees."
good,Management put little to no thought into annual reviews instead deciding performance rating based on what you were earning versus the budget they had to work with.
good,Great teammates to work with and generally have good team support however unfortunately base pay does not cover the basic living essentials so it keeps good people looking elsewhere.
good,"Overall experience at The Home Depot was good, The employees where very helpful if you needed anything. most of the managers where great to work with."
good,It's a good place to work but dont start in the summer. They cut hours as soon as winter comes and for part timers you only work 8 hours a week. If you're luck you get more hours if there is hours in other departments
good,"I'm sure some of the positions at The Home Depot are not so bad, but the customer service desk at my store took all the hits. The store was relatively understaffed and as a result the service desk was the first line od defense against complaints. Anything that was done the wrong way in the store, we got to hear about. Lack of communication was the main culprit."
good,"Managers play favorites and no one else can move up, pay isn't worth what you have to deal with, management is all over the place and coworkers are uncooperative"
good,It’s a decent place to work short term. Relatively easy tasks but not a lot of variation from day to day. Management left a lot to be desired and the attendance system should be revamped.
good,"Distribution center in langley is hard work loding flat deck trucks, dusty outdoors, rainy, management stays inside and enjoys Warm and Cold all season round and watches you with cameras."
good,"If the Store Manager or one of the Assistant Store Managers is out to get you, you dont have a chance! Enjoyed the people I worked with. You dont target your good people and push them out the door. Unrealistic expectations from management!!!!!! We are human beings! It is sad when two Store Managers are messing around with each other and Home Depot doesnt fire them but they will get rid of people who are there to build relationships with customers! You have to do alot of brown nosing to advance. If you are a hard worker, excellent driver, and get along with your people they will get rid of you!!"
good,Management had their favorites and others left out. Would not recommend the company if they had not closed their doors through iincompetent management.
good,So im a pretty hard working person i would say so and so would the people i work with but if you have other aspirations management wont ever consider you because they want you to live and breath home depot
good,I dont understand why they treat pple like if we have no morals and values. The managers there when talking swear and talk about other employees. I dont really want to talk about it due to I just rather find a new job and move forward and work for a positive company. They are just not good people to work for.
good,There was alot of poor management and alot of things beIN said to managers and nothing beining done it was a lazy environment it wasn't taken seriously about hazardous materials
good,taking in and out bound call set-up appointments for install of home depot material.Made deals with customer to purchase items that they may have seen in an ad or advertisement.
good,"Una gran empresa pero los administradores del distrito occidente, tienen mucha preferencia y no actúan conforme los valores que la empresa promueve, sería muy bueno que Eduardo Valenti tuviera una área que investigará casos de despido a fondo sobre todo de aquellos que ya hemos hecho una carrera en la empresa y que no fuera desicion solo de los distritales."
good,"Well you come in say hi to fellow workers as  walk in the door,  put on your orange apron, and walk to the service desk  ready to assist customers in front of me or on the phone. But as you are walking to your department, you get stop by customer asking you questions."
good,"I actually enjoyed my job at the Home Depot but part time hours were sometimes 4 hours a week until the holidays. It wasn't worth going to work for. There didn't seem to be much room for upward growth. A lot of unnecessary drama from some of the staff and management. If you mind your business and do your job you can stay out of the drama. That is what I did. I enjoyed working in the garden department but the tool rental area has a  lot of men sleeping around with the women in the store and customers. Very unprofessional. "
good,"It is okay, but could use some improvement and work a ton and take advantage of you no matter how hard you work. They will cut hours to barely any hours to no hours at all.They will give you extra work and will not pay you enough for the work."
good,"I was a part time associate, it was a very fun environment and I made friends that will be with me for a lifetime. I also enjoyed the learning lessons you had too do to learn new product."
good,"clock in , go to work and start cleaning aisle. Managers stand in front of you talking while you struggle with customers and packages. Very difficult to get a managers assistance"
good,"Fast pace job , counting the cashier bank, processing customer transactions, organizing and cleaning up the assigned cashier aisle. Making sure the customer has everything they need and providing great customer service."
good,"typical and long strenous days of pulling orders and staging them to proper customer pick up "
good,Computer in-service for products and knowledge for customer service. Productive on stocking products and customer service. Nice place to work and enjoy customer service.
good,A new assistant manager came to work at our store and she was on a mission to clean house. Unfortunately I was in her scope but luckily I found another job. I loved designing kitchens and baths but did not like working at Home Depot. Health Insurance is too expensive versus hourly pay.
good,"With many people working at this organization, there was a clear cut division of power. If you worked through an agency and were not hired by Home Depot then management would favour the individuals who are employed by Home Depot and the agency employees were treated differently."
good,"Home Depot is a great company. Working for the MET team was fun until the new district manager, Matt Olmo came in. He's very rude and narcissistic. They forced me to resign and gave me 1200 dollars in cash on the day I left."
good,"Good - reasonable salaries, collaborative, unlimited sick leave"
good,"The biggest pro: work flexibility. You can work nights, evenings, mornings, one day a week, nearly 40 hours. It's pretty accommodating for working while attending school."
good,"I usually start my work at 8:00 pm,collaboratively plan out and make sure the projects being handed to me gets done within the time frame.I tend to complete the most important projects first."
good,I was hired f/T before Obamacare forced employers to cut back employees whom were not management. I worked as what is considered a Freight Team member in the Receiving Dept.. I restocked store products mainly in the Paint Dept. as well as throughout store and assisted customers. I assisted with training new employees and worked well with everyone.
good,I was the only cashier on the register usually from 2pm - 6pm everyday and would get in trouble if I had more than 3 people in my line for more than 5-6 minutes.  the company is all about the numbers from a survey on the receipt and from getting credit applications.
good,"very busy, enjoyed it, very hot in summers, and very cold in winters. vending machines in break room. enjoyed the travel to other Distribution centers, and store checks."
good,"Inconsistent hours for part-time workers - made it hard as a student. Loved most coworkers, but management was not consistent and not always on top of their stuff."
good,It does not matter if you give 110% everyday it will never be enough.  If you are great in the position that you are in you will never promote. you can be responsible for 10 million in sales a year and hope to see a $200 bonus if your lucky
good,Started out as a Cashier and then ran and operated and maintained the New Self Check-out system that was installed.  Worked part time in evenings to supplement income due to disable spouse.  helping customers by suggesting the items they may need or be looking for.
good,Working hard means everyone tells you to do everything while most sit back and relax. There was not many associates who where willing to lend a hand. As a deliveries associate I was treated like a dog.
good,Was a good place to work. other employees were fun to work with. Supervision needs to be improved lack of communication with workers. pay needs to be increased.
good,"Honestly, I hated it and wouldn't recommend working for Home Depot to anyone who isn't a strong, burly/built person with the emotional range of a teaspoon. It is NOT an environment for people who are sensitive, mainly because of the general clientele. The only enjoyment I had was when I got to work in the garden department because I was surrounded by plants (Christmastime was the best because of the fresh pine trees and wreaths). The management wasn't the best; they didn't take the time to get to know their employees or care about if they were sick or not. I actually got fired because I had to be sent home early several times due to debilitating pain caused by issues with certain internal organs, and they were unsympathetic in spite of the multiple doctors' notes I provided and proof of prescriptions I was taking for my condition at the time. 10 out of 10, would not recommend."
good,"Hard work and not enough help assisting customers, it gets very hectic. The new labor model has you everywhere in the store. It is hard to help customers in a timely manner."
good,"I liked working there, I just wish the hours were better and that you could be full time with out having to work both Sat. and Sun. There is a lot of training classes that you have to have completed while you were also working."
good,I worked very hard in this store. The first manager was excellent but the second manager lacked direction. I never saw a raise for the employees even when the store makes millions in a week. There was no job security.
good,It was very busy. I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know. My manage didn't know how to talk to the employees. It was do it yourself store. The hardest part was dealing with the disrespect from the Manager. The enjoyable part was dealing with customers.
good,"I enjoyed working w/ the crew that was in place in all departments. It was at times difficult due to the fact that your department supervisor would tell you one thing, the assistant manager would tell you to stop and take on a new task, the main manager would then stop you and tell you to do another task. at that point your department supervisor would track you down and was upset that you didn't do what they asked. So you explain that you were pulled off and who told you to do a different task. then the Assistant manager would locate you and you would have to go through the same conversation again."
good,Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other jobs out there that don't treat you like garbage. Home Depot has very little investment in their employees.
good,Hours are very inconsistent. They range from 13-30 hours perweek. Without notice. Difficult to pay the bills on such inconsistency. There is not much room for advancement. There are not enough employees on duty in all departments. It is difficult to help customers when there is no employee available.  Frustrating!
good,"Show up grab my equipment... Wait for morning meeting to be over, then head to whatever department I'm working in that day and get started. It's a fast pace environment."
good,"lots of favoritism with very mean management staff. They do not accommodate to anyone who is having personal issues, not understanding at all. over all co workers are fun and helpful."
good,"Very busy all day long.  They assigned your schedule and every week was all over the place sometimes opening other times closing, so it was a long day."
good,Starting a new position was fun and exciting.  The work became routine with very little recognition for going beyond job expectations. Very little opportunities for advancement from this position.  General morale of associates is low.
good,"This company starts out as a ""family"" oriented business but a few years down the road the whole culture changes. People are promoted based on popularity with management, NOT job knowledge or excellent customer service. In fact several Dept Heads seem to have no business being in the role they are in. Dept heads are encouraged to ""write up"" associates for every little thing like talking, or asking a rude customer to not swear. Rude customer's are typically given a discount so they will come back and spend more money. This company ONLY is concerned with profits and staffs departments so poorly that the customer gets little to no service. Associates have to cover multiple areas and then get written up for providing ""poor"" customer service. This is a company I recommend working while you look for a REAL job. The management is unprofessional and your boss is typically a Collage Student who management feels has ""potential"". Older worker's are typically NOT promoted."
good,"At the time I was working there at the Aberdeen location, we had some mishaps with the management team. "
good,"Being a sales consultant for the Home Depot is hard work, but it can be very rewarding.  Support services are there and should be taken advantage of."
good,Good peers and steady pace work. Management does not give insight to grow and only give opportunities to people they like not by how they work. Very good knowledge to be picked up.
good,At my time at the Home Depot I have noticed that the employees stick up for one another and they are really good people.  Unfortunately the management at my store is hard to talk to as well as I felt like I was promised something that they never fulfilled
good,"Working at the home depot has done nothing but encourage me to pursue my degree and quickly. The company as a whole says they are college student friendly and veteran friendly but actually working in a store can be different. I know that its all relative to the people you work with and the customers that come to your store, but I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,La exigencia de los gerentes sobre las ventas es extrema a veces sin tener en cuentas que los empleados no tienen la preparación adecuada para atender a los clientes.
good,"When offered overtime I would gladly take it, I enjoyed working in the area I did even though I was trained for another position.  I left there because of health reasons."
good,"A typical day was designing kitchens for customers. I learned  kitchen design from scratch and became one of the stores most successful. The management culture was sometimes difficult to work with, The workplace culture left a lot to be deisired."
good,The Home Depot is a very upbeat scene where you can easily get side tracked be customers needing different things at once. You will constantly be asked about products that you may have no knowledge about.
good,"Sometimes it gets busy and sometimes its slow, main priority will always be customer service. You take care of tasks such as making sure the shelves are maintained brining down stock while also taking care of customers. That might be the hardest part sometimes."
good,"As a part time employee my hours would vary wildly from week to week. As long as,at the end of the year, I averaged less than 25 hours per week it was ok."
good,Job is not hard but management and the lack of real leadership everybody knows best and everything usual is always wrong the cut throat atmosphere the high school demeanor of leadership they strive for goal an not your well being it makes the job much harder then needed! Your a robot and must perform as one with minimum to no talking job is not hard but management makes the job so much stressful
good,Not a place to work if you got to provide for a family the pay sucks the hours sucks they ask you to do to much for only 10 an hour. The co workers are in competitions for sales and homer badges. Just a lot of drama.
good,management shows favouritism to employees that they are sleeping with. They protect the employees that they are sleeping with and the ones they wish to sleep with by giving them the less meaningful task to complete  such as greeters.
good,"Not an ideal place for growth. Given it is retail, but there is no room for creativity or input of any kind. The workplace culture is somewhat stressful, and this extends to most of the employees I have worked with there, including the managers, who are fearful of losing their jobs. I learned a bit about maintaining a professional atmosphere and safety procedures, but overall you go to work, do what your told, and then go home. It feels lifeless."
good,"Scheduling was like a roller coaster ride.  You never knew what your schedule was going to be like.  You could be working a late night, and then a very early morning the next day, and repeating that cycle for extended periods of time.  The work environment was not conducive to happiness."
good,"I would arrive to work, do a walk thru my department to make sure everything was safe.  I would greet customers help with design and materials needed. Special order products to size."
good,it was a part time job so i expected to work at most 20 hours a week. my first summer there was 40 hours almost every week. product knowledge was big and they only teach you about 5 or 6 of them in there classes. the rest you learn on your own. a big part of the job was watering plants and loading mulch and dirt into customer vehicles. forklift and order picker licence not required but its harder to help customers without them.
good,"Keep in mind i was in freight ,we went to work at 5 and got off at 10 sometimes we worked all night . I didn't care for the hours and tried to get day hours. i would go in at five and help unload the trucks and stock shelves.The job was not bad but the hours i didn't agree with."
good,"a typical day is busy with complaining customers, and lazy co-workers who always leaves early."
good,"I used to love working for this company.  However, within the past year, there have been so many changes on all levels of in store and district management that it has been nearly impossible to do anything right.  By the time you feel comfortable with what you're doing and who you're working for, those people are gone and you have to start from scratch and prove yourself again.  After outstanding reviews,I was promised to be promoted within 18 months.  Imagine having that promise made multiple times in under four years with no pay off."
good,"A good job but not much opportunity for advancement. There seemed to only be a few manager positions and those that bid for them seem to be in constant struggle to prove themselves. As for the hourly associate, Often I found my co-workers in constant state of confusion. At times wandering aimisly in the sea of unorginized buerocrisy that Homedepot corporates fine so thrilling. I found that the raises came quick but the Cap came quicker. If you do see yourself on the climbing end of Homedepots managerial positions, I will bid you good luck. For me, it seemed the risk was not worth the reward."
good,my team and I did not get the support we needed from management even when we went to them and asked for help or suggestions of how to deal with situations
good,Management not in touch with it's employees.  They tend to back the customer even if the customer is completely wrong and it makes the associate appear weak.
good,"It's retail can sum it up right there. Sell, sell, sell is what you will here and by the way, you can do it for the most part alone. When that place is busy forget getting help and management can tend to look at the associates as lower class than themselves. You can also give up weekends entirely, you will be working them and also, work until 10:00pm on Tuesday and report back at 5:00am the next day. I give anyone who works in retail all the credit they deserve knowing that they don't get paid or treated very well."
good,The local store is good people. The District allocation of hours is limited where you may need a second job to make sure your bills are payed. You are dealing with continual situation in flex. You might have enough hours one week then you may be scraping the next. Hardest part of the job is  item sku not matching in the computer system. That frustrates the customer and limits the associate from selling the product needed. Of course you meet creative people on the job you see some cool ideas and things to improve your home and projects.
good,"Once you make it past the lack of hours and bitter co-workers it actually isn't a bad place to work. Every job has their ups and downs it just takes a lot of character and self-control to see it thru and not lose your marbles by the end of the day because no matter what position you apply for, there will be no exception for the stress the store will pour upon you. "
good,"The people I worked with were great; but as with most ""big box"" and home improvement stores, you won't ever see 40 hours a week, you'll be lucky to get half that."
good,"The company claims to value it's associates, but in truth, politics come to the front of the line. They are more concerned with appearances and the bottom line, than with their employee needs. the benefits are offered, but unaffordable."
good,"A lot of changes have occurred within the Distribution Center in the last one to two years which have decreased our work hours and our job responsibilities.  I have held several positions within this facility, but with the increased changes my current position is a General Warehouse Associate.  Therefore, a typical work day for me is operating equipment pulling/picking customer orders.  I enjoy staying busy and completing task in a timely manner.  However, my position is not challenging me enough or utilizing my abilities to their fullest.  Without relocating to other distribution centers within Home Depot there is really no opportunities for job advancement in my current facility."
good,"Basic retail job with basic duties, not a great place to work. Management was poor, the hours were not great. Not a great learning experience due to bad environment."
good,"Management and earning potential promises were made and not kept no matter what was accomplished regarding sales increases and voice of the customer reviews. Took each department from the bottom three in the district consistently for a long period of time to the top three in comp, profit and shrink within 2 months of being moved to those departments. "
good,"*Optimized merchandise transition between retailer and consumer in over $1 million annual inventory"
good,"Como todo trabajo tiene restricciones, pero te da muchas oportunidades de crecimiento"
good,"Home Depot passed me over for a full time position & gave it to another who had not even worked in that department, didn't show an interest in it & told me that he had a kid & a wife."
good,They expect way too much for little pay. You would be written up if you do not get a X amount of credit card apps per week. They micromanage way too much.
good,"When I worked for Home Depot over a period of 5 years total, my experience with managment was not good. From managers that got promoted because they were the upper eshelons tool, or they were ""yes men"". They didnt promote much free thinking. They had me on 3p to 12a shifts because I was good at down stocking.One of the managers even hit on my now ex-wife when I was at work. She was at the club with her friends, he knew it was my wife and he was married. I complained and got sent to lot duty until he was promoted to run the Janzen Beach store. I  was  on 3 to 12s for several years. Ruined my first marriage. Never got promoted no matter how hard I worked, they would dangle that carrot tho. Pay raises were a joke. Not even keeping up with inflation. Then there was a drastic cutback in salaries.  They no longer hired experienced people to work in the departments. "
good,"Just looking for something in my career field, on a typical day it can be hectic because of how the management chose to run the shift. The only thing that was hard about the job is the work load they put on you because they think dayshift does not have time because they place more on sales than they do the person on nights."
good,"Worked at an HD in the socal area. Cool place, co-workers were either laid back older guys (typically ex-contractors and/or construction guys) and some younger guys and gals.Management sucked and was always trying to stress sales; didn't affect my wallet tho so who really cares). In the end, cool place with bad pay."
good,"Force to work with little to no help constantly, managers expect you to complete two people jobs, solo. Yearly salary upgrade not that much either like 10 to 20 cents a year."
good,I loved the customers. But management and the way this business is being run was very poor. Would not recommend. Was treated poorly. no benefits. thumbs down
good,"loved the company and the fun that csme with the events we held and contests, management had alot of empty promises, i ran 2 depts for 6 months on my own without the pay of management then they promoted a new guy and made me train him for the job i deserved"
good,Home Depot is a place where I learned different skills and got the opportunity to obtain a Forklift license. Good work life balance! I enjoy working here for the most part.
good,"Worked directly with walk-in contractors, general public and managed stores largest contractors. "
good,"Home Depot is a great Builders' warehouse. There is much learning. Like a typical work place with lots of man power turn over, a horse and a donkey would be rated on similar scales. Very little scope for job advancement. Work schedules were never consistent and one would not know whether he or she is starting work or ending work."
good,"I assume it's a typical job that a student would get: High turnover, hard to get time off, inconvenient shifts. Management were fine people, but they weren't very responsive. A couple seemed to like bossing people around too much."
good,"People do not need credit card ,especially in the east area. The try to force their workers to push for credit even when customers do not want them. People just want check out quickly and carry on with their day/job. There are those that have bad credit as is and the last thing they need is another one to add on to their debt. Over-all great work place and easy work but cashiers or even any worker shouldn't be forced to fight for their job in the chase for credit apps. ESPECIALLY if people do not want/ need them to begin with."
good,"Nice working environment"
good,"The harder you work the less credit you get.  The culture is all about making sure associates are having fun and playing games.  Work can be fun but people shouldn't have to go out of their way to plan an entire day each week around making it fun.  By thanking associates, showing them appreciation for a job well done and by working with associates makes them feel like coming to work.  Knowing that someone notices what they do each day is important.    Supervisors that are ""hands on"" and work their departments on a daily basis are treated with less respect than those that sit in a back office during their shift and never step onto the sales floor"
good,Home Depot never accepted doctors notes when it said I was unfit to work with chemical burning in my eyes. They wrote me up for leaving early because of my eyes after they threatened to fire me if I didn't show. They also fired me the day my doctor's note expired after my severe accident. They waited to do that so I could sue them.
good,Can be a stressful environment. At times can be fast paced. Starting salary is $10 an hour but barely any hours are given a week. Ive definitely learned to work hard.
good,Nice place to work if you want extra money. They keep everyone at part time to avoid offering benefits and the hourly rate is poor.. This is how Home Depot is profitable. Paying low wages.
good,Long hard hours at night.  Understaffed and high quotas.  Pay was poor could be better.  No employee discount.  Overworked for the low pay.  Advancement more likely if your willing to relocate.
good,They are a good company just could've paid more for the task/duties I did. They try to work with your outside life to help with schedule. They will let you work as long as you want hrs
good,A good retail place to work. Fairly good pay for retail. Good work hours too. They have a bad habit of laying off people when sales are down. Lots of layoffs and new hires.
good,"A typical work day consists of helping customers, stocking shelves, organizing, figuring out inventory along with other tasks. The work place culture I did not like. TO qualify for anything you have to be Full-time. You ask the managers for help and they question you along with saying they will do something numerous times. They like singling out the teens and part-timers. The hardest part, is being a cashier, you have to meet a quota on credit cards. The quota is the same as the full timers. When they go to winter hours and you only get 8 hours per week as a part timer, you cant pay bills, and you are at a huge disadvantage on that quota, compared to full timers. The store manager makes promises he can not keep. Management singles people out over there. To get time off you need to know your schedule 1 month in advance that's a huge problem when your a senior, entering college. I have been there a year but they messed up my account and had to rehire me so it says only 6 months, they made me a promise saying that wouldn't happen."
good,"Home depot depends on your location. While working up in Washington state, it was great, I loved it and it was a ton of fun, once moving back to Florida, the job was completely different due to the management, or the lack there of."
good,"In a company that requires you to be in your store with no pay, it is unfathomable that they cannot afford to provide sales consultants with more leads.  You are required to create your own leads while being in the store, but you do not get paid for the time you are in your store."
good,"Management gets uptight when your just standing around, but your not allowed to leave you cash register area and you wait for shoppers to come to your check out line."
good,The Home Depot was a great workplace. It helped me grow in so many areas. I would recommend it from someone who is looking for a job. As long as you arrive on time you'll be fine.
good,"Productive and fun workplace that provides quick advancements. Although, a discount isnt provided for employees, there are plenty of other wonderful benefits."
good,"Led a team of 8, used problem solving skills daily, practiced great customer service.  Long hours with little pay.  Prior to leaving I was being consider for management."
good,"Wages are pitiful and raises are even worse. They preach customer service, but fail to give employees the necessary staffing to be of any use. They hire teenagers who don't come to work, don't stay long, and get fired easily. Customers expect associates to know their jobs, but 90% of the employees have been there less than 1-2 yrs."
good,"The legacy of Nardelli is alive and well at the depot. I was let go for giving ""too Many"" discounts to my contractors even though I was pressured to do so. I even had an exemplary review and was to be given a rare $1/hour raise (unheard of at the Depot). But for a customer who had spent $17000 with us, a $900 discount was just too much to bear for management even though they would have given 10% ($1700) off with out a second thought if that customer was military.  The random nature of management decision making fosters favoritism and animosity between the associates and management. I was hoping to stay and have a positive effect at the Depot but the hurdles were just to high to make it worthwhile. There are good people at the stores but invariably it is the case that the managers are the weak link in the chain and for some reason the structure seems to elevate those who are least effective at that position."
good,"It was ok , it could have been better especially with managers and supervisors. They need to work on that a lot more and be more flexible with the employees"
good,Working for a big store like home depot i learn to move fast especially when you know overnight crew was expecting everything to be ready for when they got there. Unloading and loading trucks with forklift and pallet jack or even a conveyor belt.
good,"It is your typical retail environment, sell, sell, sell..., when slow cut hours add stress to the employees left to cover the store..................."
good,Management is not understanding and need to learn SOP. They Put myself on a final warning while my i was out on family emergency!!! so that tells alot about a company that clains leinency
good,"easy, somewhat fun. "
good,"Home Depot as a whole is an amazing company to work for, the key is finding a great department to work with in the company. My Department does not put a lot of energy in placing the right manager for the position."
good,"Despite the less than acceptable work environment, I made the best of it. Not given any training on small engine repair/maintenance, I set about to teaching myself. Thru trial and error and book knowledge. Same applies to the electronic tools etc . Became so proficient at repairs that management sent me to other tool rentals in the district to repair their down tools and teach their tool tech how to fix them on their own."
good,"Was hired as a cashier and was told I had to do lot while the paperwork was changed, took over a month to change. Then was out at cashier for 2 days and moved to other departments in the store. Coworkers were fun though, however the pay is very weak and everyone is paid the same whether you work in lumber or are a cashier."
good,Get ready to work because this is non stop un loading trailers and pallets work place was nice had a nice lunch room. they fed you. good hours good pay.
good,"Stressful work environment,management dose not fulfill full time hour promises, low pay, expensive and low covarage benefits, not enough coverage for most departments, very stretched thin on people"
good,"I had a lot of"
good,"Retail is always stressful and even more so when management is not supporting.  Always cutting hours, leaving employees in departments alone during busy times."
good,"First retail job, management was okay, good pay, but a lot of the employees are only part time.Almost no befits when compared to the food service.  slow paced sometimes, .but could be very busy and stressful at other times."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for and has lots of opportunity for advancement. But its all in who manages the store. A store can be a great place or a miserable place dependent ont he manager.
good,"Once you hit the level of management, you have very little consideration of your schedule. You may work close down 3pm-12am on one day and then be asked to open the next morning at 6am. It is very difficult to schedule time with family or even get on a consistent sleep schedule. Entry level positions have a much more lenient schedule."
good,If you are looking to get some basic phone and sales experience this would be a good job hours are 830am to 10pm they do offer work from home option however management is a little hard to work with
good,"You can learn a lot about building materials, but coworkers are decent at best, management is decent at best, pay isn't balanced with how much they expect out of you."
good,Not enough pay for the amount of trash you have to deal with from managers and customers. The option to choose between 30 min or 1 hour lunches were nice.
good,"Greeting customers"
good,"Average retail environment. Not always clear what goals are and management is under a lot of pressure from higher ups resulting in periodic stress. The higher you go in the organization, the less secure your job becomes so think carefully before accepting a promotion."
good,"If you have a hard time being hired by people, don't worry home depot will take you."
good,"Associates in most retail environments are thought disposable and typically not for lack of  any commitment on their part. It is a business ""philosophy"" that gets reflected daily when company management interacts with its associates. It sets up a stressful environment of never knowing if today will be your last,"
good,"Fully engaged in daily stocking of departmental shelves and processing custom paint mixing orders."
good,too much to do without enough people. management poor. low pay for heavy work. everyday lots of returns while co wokers chatting and messing around. managers never to be found. messy aisles. rude condescending customers.
good,"Working at Home Depot could be a lot better if there was more communication. A store manager can NOT sit in an office and bark orders to ASM's.  You are hired as part-time and if you do well you can be made full-time.  Taking care of the customers is the top priority, however, it is difficult to do when you are the only one a customer sees in two to three depts.  Part-time employees quit because their ours get cut back and the good employees are not recognized. Too much favoritism and ones that do lack luster work know how to work the system."
good,"Typical retail job. Unpredictable hours and varying hectic scheduling. Quick paced environment, lots of employee learning opportunities provided by company."
good,"At home depot, there is just not any opportunity for career advancement and this would be considered a life line position. At this position my duties include helping the cashier's with upset customers keeping a daily schedule for the cashiers."
good,"Favoritism, jealousy and unprofessional. I got full time within 30 days for busting my behind and the entire store went against. I got threats, left out of activities and it made me just put in my two weeks and quit."
good,Home Depot is a good company.  I have grown a lot in the eleven years that I spent at Home Depot.  If there was something that I could change about Home Depot it would be the work/life balance which was non-existent.
good,"Working at Home Depot was a good but bad experience. My position working at Home Depot was a garden associate and water girl. By just being a water girl if plants were to die i would be the first to be accused because it's my job to water them daily, however as a company I shouldn't be the only employee watering plants throughout the day. While I was working at Home Depot I was a high school senior working 5am shifts and wasn't allow to take off days to prepare for graduation and to move into college."
good,"All in all, not a bad place to work. I have learned a lot about home improvement and handy skills. Home Depot does not currently offer the advancement and career goals that I am interested in."
good,It was just a fill in job until the economy turned around.  Enjoyed working with the customers.  It allowed me to work with customers and help them make decisions as to mill work items and building materials.
good,"No chance of advancement, low pay and low hours (they cut hours for part time so it is not even worth it to come to work)  I was passed over for head cashier four times and they even hired from the outside for this position.  I trained her!  Not enough staff in the aisles.  Enjoyed my coworkers.  Worked with obsolete equipment."
good,"home depot was an ""okay"" job.. Sometimes we would disagree a lot but we all still worked as a team. home depot pays okay but they do not give you as many hours in the day as one should have."
good,"The jobs are pretty routine, however they do not give overtime, and they only hire for part-time positions. No room for advancement. The management is poorly run, and the communication between managers is non-existent. A good position if you're part-time and it's a job for after school hours. Otherwise, not the most ideal position for most."
good,Son buenas las capacitaciones y las prestaciones pero el ambiente laboral no es muy bueno
good,There is a divide in work loads. While some people can stand around with no punishment others are made to work extra hard with no reward or incentive.
good,"I worked for Home Depot in Rialto, CA for ten years.  Where do I start.  I bought into the whole idea of bleeding orange, and worked many different department.  As a whole, most any HD store has hard working great associates.  Management on the other hand is AWFUL!!!!  In ten years I had 7 store managers.  They either slept with the female employees, stole, or just really sucked as managers.  The culture is to harass the employees, keep them off balance, keep them always worried about loosing their jobs.  I can't recommend working there, I lost 10 years of my life."
good,"If have friend or a relative in  management you will .succeed in job advancement, if not forget it. Years service and hard work will not n matter.  Be in right click."
good,"Job is way to stressful for the amount of pay. Have to work various reports, daily, weekly and monthly which should be done by supervisors but are delegated to associates without compensation."
good,"I was hired on the spot as a head cashier and I wasn't happy with being a head cashier because of my own preference but I was there full time and I still was making NO MONEY, just wasn't enough money no matter how much I worked. the sore feet from the concrete floors was not worth it.  Its great for young children just getting their foot int he door but for the professional aspect not the best idea."
good,It was just a job and I needed one. NOthing special. Scheduling was inconsistent. Pay and opportunity for advancement were poor. It's a large soulless big box company with no regard for its employees.
good,"This is a great first starting out job you can move up."
good,over worked under payed.poor management'Iworked lot for over a year. no one's done this before. only out two days in over a year no one cared.I trained everyone.
good,This was a tough company to work for. they would rather pay to part time employees than pay a full time employee with the skills. there was a high turnover rate a Home depot so having to constantly train new people made for production to go down.
good,"Poor training and management .and customer service on the by the mangers are laughable at most due to how they would treat some customers differently for some the same favors.Would use associate  scapegoats if not part of thier ""circle"""
good,"Like any other retail job, the hours are crazy and customers can be extremely rude. Especially if you are a female, the male customers can be disrespectful."
good,Good for learning about home products and getting used to some tools and different things about a house.  People are friendly to work with and are not very educated.  This is more physical than mental work.
good,"Home Depot does a nice job building a great atmosphere, hiring good people, and helping the community. With that said, they can't mask the fact that they don't pay associates nearly enough or provide any kind of stability in hours to make it a legitimate career."
good,"This was a pretty good place to work my first few years there, but then management changed. As head cashier was promoted to supervisor, all she cared about was how fast she could climb that ladder to success. Cashiers were left without a supervisor as she was never around and began to bicker and step on each others toes trying to be the boss that wasn't there. Room for advance was nil unless you wanted to wait 10 years or more to move up."
good,only worked five hours a day some days no one showed up boring days slow pass hate standing around rather have a place i can be doing something non stop
good,"just like every cashier job its a good place to start if you need money"
good,"If you are interested in construction I would recommend starting here, opens a lot of doors to the industry however most employees quickly realize all they have to do to get a check is show up and hide..."
good,Working with the home depot is depressing some times.you have to be careful who you talk to if you dont want it told.i just want to work with more friendly people
good,"They give you all sorts of shifts to work, you could close one night and have to turn around and be there at 5am the next morning.  Do not care at all about how the employees feel.  Management does not back the employees up, they tell you to do one thing and they turn around and do another."
good,"You must be able to keep up with customers who are on the go and be able to help them with their needs while promoting credit cards, loyalty programs, and surveys in order to provide great customer care."
good,"Long hours, some of the best people I ever worked with and built friendships with were fellow co-workers and supervisors. I do have a personal beef that I did not like that I will voice. To save money the management decided to cut costs by removing overnight staff and forced them to sign a contract saying they will get a large wage cut per hour, lose all benefits even though you were a full time employee already receiving them and have your hours cut from full time hours (40 per week) to under 20 hours as a part time worker during the day. They forced several people to sign this contract or were to be fired on the spot. A majority of the staff that had this happen to them quit and never looked back. This has left a very bad taste in my mouth with that company for the bonds and camaraderie of professionalism I built up with staff was a high light of my time spent there. It was sad that this event took place but I do thank the company for allowing me the opportunity to save up money to buy my vehicle that I am currently driving today."
good,"Friendly employees and work environment. The store was always organized. Learned how to better serve the costumers and help them making the right choices. Learned how to drive the forklift, reach truck, and op. Management tried to help us employees when we needed help. My job was enjoyable, and I didn't find any task hard."
good,Love the customers and fellow associates management not so much I don't think when new management comes in that they need to clean house granted some people need to go but there process is not right
good,"Input all associates production sheets, to get an accurate productivity count for the day. Management is a bit difficult to get along with, but I always see the better side of my job. As far as advancement i really don't see it with Home Depot, I have expressed to them that I would like to move on from what I am doing, but they always give me excuses. What I most dislike is that they pay the new associate more than what they pay people that have been here for years."
good,"The day starts with walking into your department with hopes of a stress free day, some are... but some are definitely the top of the ""harder ones"" list.  The work isn't hard, the experience you gain is worth learning when it comes to owning and maintaining your home.  The management is there to help in some cases, but not when you need them most.  I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to work with the fun committee."
good,"Management at the home depot played favoritism, only advanced people who took every and i mean every phone call to come in to work on a day off. I have been there only two years, but was promised a promotion for the last year, which i have yet to receive ."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot in Florida for the short time I lived in Florida. I worked in the outside garden area and enjoyed it very much and learned a lot about gardening for the dept. heads.
good,"management seems to care more about drastically exceeding their numbers than they do about their associates. they dont care how the work gets done they will push you to the bone to get things done and still complain about it when you're done. i personally dont feel appreciated at the home depot which is why i am searching for new employment. my typical day starts with unloading nothing but heavy freight, receiving it on OM system, labeling and throwing said freight; and continue to do this day in and day out. most of the time by myself while others get to work in groups. and when i request help to constantly be there to help me everyday i feel like i get blown to the side. most enjoyable part of the day is my drive home"
good,"Effective place for getting work done, sales experience, etc. The Home Depot provides an environment for one to learn all about home good needs and also for meeting new people."
good,The home depot RDC is an OK place to work. The pay could be way better for what is being expected of the worker... You get what you pay for I would say. the management need help for sure.
good,"I honestly feel it depends on the managers, staff and the department itself that you work in.  Not sure how all of the other areas of the company work"
good,Home Depot is a great environment for people to work in. At some times it can be stressful although the support from other employees is great. Home Depot is delightful overall.
good,The values wheel is talked about but not demonstrated within the walls of the KCC. There are some wonderful people working here.  Success Sharing bonus twice a year.
good,It's a good place to start and get the experience you need to pursue a career in  the warehouse industry. They treat me ok but it's day by day at the job.
good,"i would not recommend working here full time the pay is not there, part-time i would since its very easy work to help balance out a busy schedule for extra money."
good,"The Home Depot is any other enormous corporate retailer.  There is minimal room for advancement and low pay but some job security.  The managers treated me fairly.  I worked overnight which was my huge criticism and management did not seem willing to move me to days despite ""promoting"" me to full time hours, giving me a decent raise and telling me I was on track for management.  There is zero positive culture at the Home Depot and the typical employee acts as if they have been wronged by the company. They have not and no company will hold your hand along the way.  I was realistic about this job upon being hired, and with that attitude i was content overall, it was never a career job."
good,"I have no comment. it was not enjoyable to work there, all they were are about money. Did not care on how associates felt,or if they were given a fare chance with the company"
good,After 5 years and only receiving less than $2 in raises it just wasn't worth the time. I saw them promise people a position just for them to give it to someone else while they used the original employee's excitement of advancement to make them do more work with more responsibilities without paying them
good,Not enough sales associates. No room for advancement. Full time positions non existence. Irregular schedules. Must work most holidays. Lack of communication from management.
good,"Here at Home Depot I learned a lot of new things about hardware and tools. BUT, that came at a cost. Home Depot is a very slow paced work environment so if you love working with people or talking to people this job isn't for you"
good,"Not great, but not terrible. Depends on your management team honestly. Part time benefits are ok, but they are really stingy about handing out full time positions, so good luck getting one."
good,can take a long time to become full-time. Only get dental insurance if part-time. Home Depot isn't a bad place to work but it can be hard. If you are good at butt kissing then you are going to love it!
good,"cut and stack lumber,"
good,"A typical day at  work would include helping many customers find different products, I have learned to be calm while in a stressful situation. The management is laid back and lazy. The hardest part of my job is dealing with irate customers. the most enjoyable part of my job is my lunch time."
good,"This Job I would not recommend for a career, but a great starter job for out of school students looking for part time work. Life balance is very unsteady.  Home Depot is a part time company that takes at least two years of solid 150% dependability to be considered for full time.  The best part of my experience were floor associates and there eagerness to take care of the customer."
good,It came at just the right time in my life and allowed me to stay a while longer but your hours as a temp are funny at best. I truly understand they have there rules. It is partly they don't want any overtime and they want give all people equal time (I guess).
good,"Average starting job; good manager, one really bad assistant manager. Depending on who was manager at the store, it could be a good shift or a bad one."
good,Good place and great people needs more people that are willing to work. Communication can be better from management to people doing the work. Need More people for coverage.
good,"nice environment, is very busy but the customers ar4 every friendly. you get to meet a lot of different people with some cool projects that they are trying to do"
good,"Typical day , clock in clock out "
good,"hard work for low pay"
good,Home Depot corporate views are very different than what you will encounter on a normal day to day basis. There seems to be a lot of uncertainty from supervisors and low level management.
good,"Designing rooms, spaces, from easy to difficult. Selling Cabinetry, countertops, and other items for the project.  pulling all aspects together for the customer. As a designer, it's not a good place to be a professional. Very little support in this position!"
good,"I  do  not working  at  the  Home  Depot,  at  least  the  particular  one  I  work at. It  is  an  uphill  battle  for  a  promotion  if  you  are  a  minority."
good,"issues arent resolved, instead they are ignored and blame is placed. job can be physical at times, culture takes engagement to a good level. hard to come to work for terrible pay."
good,"The Home Depot is a cool place to work at. The regulars/customers are a joy once you get to know them. Management needs some work. Sometimes you are left to the wolves and have to solve customer issues by yourself without a higher level of authority. Management is hardly seen, hard to find, and hard to get a hold of when customers need help or have an issue. The hardest part about working at The Home Depot was closing the department down after working a nine hour shift by myself with no coverage and this happened on several occasions. The most enjoyable part of working at Home Depot is the coworkers. After a while you establish sister and brother like relationships with a few coworker and we all helped  each other in and outside of the store."
good,Home Depot #1961 is a fun place to work in when certain coworkers are there. Management wants you to do things at the last minute. Its hard to move up in the company.
good,"Doesn't give good raises, biased to certain employees. To difficult to move up within the company. Turnover rate is horrible. No employee discounts."
good,I was in the Lumber and building materials department. It's very heavy work and the pay is the same as everyone else. I was happy because of the people that I worked with. It's just a job.
good,Good entry level job out of high school. A person cant live on 20 hours a week. There is no job security. I enjoyed working in electrical but was pulled out and sent back to lumber which I didn't feel was right.
good,"I worked as a cashier, my manager was horrible she yelled at customers and employees alike any time her boss wasn't around. If you are a cashier you will be on your feet all day in the same spot unable to move even a few feet away. Best places to be in the store are the Paint department which is fun and you get to play with mixing colors all day and in the garden during winter (you can build snowmen) during winter the garden section gets quiet and you can watch the snow fall. its really pretty."
good,"The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."
good,Great if your looking for a part time job. Hard for them to keep good workers between the pay and hours and the work they want you to put in. And they push to promote But get a lot of stringing you along.
good,The process of selecting leaders is not based on leadership potential but perception.  This leads to high potential associate turnover.
good,I worked in 3 diffrent departments for my time there and all the departments i was in are easy to learn people there are kind and outgoing.
good,"Not unlike what I would expect to find in a large retail organization. Profit is 1st, people are way down the list.  Management structure appears cumbersome, and redundant in some aspects. Communication is all top down. Efforts to produce maximum profit, results in planned under-staffing, and subsequently high stress."
good,Productive and fast paced store   I worked with great co-workers  fun to meet new people every day  during holidays and big sales the store got much busier and it made the day go by faster
good,nice work environment but the scheduling is horrible. management is easy to talk to but nothing ever gets accomplished or fixed. good starting job or for someone who is looking for part time work and limited hours just to get out of the house but it is retail so be prepared it isnt easy.
good,"i believe that home depot is a good company to work for, however the store i worked in treated their employees very unfairly. management was very rude and not understanding. You couldnt go to them to file a complaint on anything. They chose favorites, while being very rude to the people they didnt like."
good,really enjoyed the job didn't really have a problem working here. The work was hard and steady. Coworkers were cool and taught me good moving and packaging skills. Hardest part of the day would depend on your load. The most enjoyable part of the day was the breaks they took good car of they're employees.
good,Work place is very busy and customer traffic is always at a moderate flow. There is always work available during a shift and new material to learn for the advancement of every associated.
good,"management is confused here it has its priorities out of order, not a pleasant place to be. just to  say it again the company Home Depot is a good company, this is just a bad store."
good,"As merely a cashier spent most time standing in one place. Prefer moving around. Time appeared to stand still. When i was busy, it was a bit more entertaining."
good,The job develops no room to grow and be productive.  I see no chance in growing with this company at Home Depot.  It is out of my field of study.
good,The MET team at home depot in philadelphia PA in the LEO mall has no direction and no leadership. nobody trains anyone or helps you when they notice a struggle. Also for being a small team there is a lot of conflict and petty arguments and comments and not needed slander.
good,At my time at the Home Depot I was treated pretty well by my fellow employees and my superiors. I gained my first work experience to begin building my resume.
good,If they cared about their employees more and put them in a position that matched there skill set it would be a much more enjoyable work environment.  overall not a bad place to work.
good,"This place hires anyone. Most employees there don't know anything about their department and make up BS to sell a product. Very boring job because during an 8 hour time period you're not aloud to do anything besides help customers, even if there are NO CUSTOMERS. Spent a lot of my time walking laps around the store. I was the youngest worker there at age 18, almost all of the other employees were either retired people who came back to work or 40 year olds that didn't go to college. Management was ok, but if it was busy don't expect any help; they expect you to fend for yourself and if you do something wrong you WILL get yelled at. Only good thing is getting paid $12.00 an hour and being able to go on leave while i was at school and come back over winter break."
good,"I only worked here a short time, but it was not a secure position or culture. I saw seasoned, long term managers and employees fired for very small infractions. Be careful if working there."
good,"répondre au client, nettoyer aire de travail, balancer les caisses"
good,"90% of the people there Including management don't care about others or customers, they are only there to get a check and make friends."
good,Depot was a decent place to work. Pay not very good. But benefits are good. They want you to be able to do it all in every area of store. They helped out in community all the time. Not good for work life balance. Once you become a dept. sup tuff to advance past that in short period of time.
good,"As a whole Home Depot is a good company to work for. The corporate mission is to take care of customers and employees as though they were a family. They encourage diversity in the workplace and growth from within."
good,What can I say it is a retail job.  The place went down hill. The pay is now very lower which result in a lot of workers not knowing a lot about do it yourself projects.
good,"Home Depot was a solid for of income, although this place of business had it's perks it also had it downfalls not sure if it was just the location of this particular company located in Hercules, Ca. where several of unresolved issues seemed to continuously be a problem with this particular location. These and many others became the reason for my resignation. Solid company though good benefits however took too long to become available especially for a single mother of two trying to get by."
good,"After working at Home Depot for over 13 years, I'm not convinced that the focus is not on helping grow the careers of their employees."
good,"This a great place to work as a started job or for someone looking for just a few extra hours who already has additional employment. This would be great for someone who is retired and just looking to get out of the house.  "
good,I dont like working here. They lie too much. I have many dissapointments with them. I barely get hours. The managers are very rude as well the coworkers.
good,"Great company depending on the management team per location."
good,"Wanted us to finish to heavy trucks by ourselves a day. It was good because it was production based, but they didn't want us doing things a faster way and had us do it a certain way."
good,"Store 3489, Rochester is drama filled and to succeed in this store U have to kiss management butt, they don't show equality between workers and they are very bias, any jobs avail in this store I would apply for Somersworth or the Portsmouth store instead, I have heard they treat they're employees ten times better than this store ."
good,Work atmosphere was satisfactory although the pay scale and room for advancement was minimal..Would like to work a full 40 hour week full time
good,"Management could care less about their employees. They let employee bullying go on and do nothing to stop it. The hire people with radical views who try to press upon you their warped values. "
good,"Great first job or, part time job for students looking for money to make. Hours are crazy and it is difficult to get a set schedule. you are expected to come to work in any weather. management is like a ladder. Under paid."
good,"this is based for the specific store that i'm in, communication and structure on how employees are setup are poor.  They can do better in both areas."
good,hardest part of the job is being in an understaffed department and dealing with an inventory system that has yet to reach the 21st century
good,"Management wasn't good."
good,I felt the company in general is a good company but the store I worked for is not professional but very cliquey.I found that the staff that were lazy resented those of us that worked and would make things up to get people in trouble.
good,"It paid the bills."
good,Sales associates expected to work in all departments.  They have training available but hard to schedule the time to do it if always short staffed.  The management more concerned with the bottom line than producing quality designs in kitchens.  It is very hard on your body lifting and moving merchandise.  Most enjoyable to work with the public.
good,"went through a merger and was very painful, wasn't fond of how the company was going. Was not valued as a employee in this role"
good,"with the proper management team, i can see some stores being fun and good to work for. overall not a terrible place to work for. just very corprate."
good,"I have very little to say about this job. I woke up at 4:00am to make it to work at 8:00am daily. The supervisor I had over me was belligerent and unprofessional. I would love a similiar job like this one, with better associates that work well together or alone."
good,"Working at the Skyview Home Depot was enjoyable for the most part."
good,"too many errors and the concern of management seems to be somewhat misguided as to how the business should run as far as contractor sales is concerned, although they make a lot of money every fiscal year I do not believe that they are maximizing the market nor do they seem to care.  very cold place to work with a rumor mill that is exhausting"
good,"my experience at the home depot is not the best one. There is a lot of immaturity at the management level and favorites is an everyday thing. i personally didnt experience it, but watched it happen and saw good people brought down to make others mistakes look ok with management."
good,Not in touch with associates' needs. Translates to not in touch with customers. Paid $200+ million for CEO to leave yet can't justify paying a livable wage to employees.
good,This is a great job with great pay. A regular job day could go either way. You could learn about alot from working here! I enjoyed the fun we had but the mangers could be a quite bit RUDE! NOT COOL!
good,"I work a minimum of 55 hours per week with a very random schedule.My store manager is horrible and make things very hard."
good,the supervisor is very hands on. I love the nature of work. the facilities is good in terms of employees handling but in terms of their management there was a lot of flaws.
good,I disliked this job. I disliked my co-workers and my managers. The only thing I liked about this job was that I could be left alone to work. I was happy to not be micromanaged. I was also happy that I could work with plants and customers.
good,"I worked here for almost 2 years. In the beginning everything and everyone is great, but once that honeymoon phase is over, everything flips. It was a lot of favoritism going on, and it was very obvious. They do not work with you about your schedule, and they are not very understanding. They claim to be all about the customers and that is not true. There were plenty of times when managers would just stand around talking when there were lines wrapping."
good,"Show appreciation towards employees"
good,no hay forma de crecer dentro de empresa contratan gente externa cuando uno tiene la capacidad de aplicar en puesto
good,"Doesn't matter how good of an employee you, how hard you work or even if you put more in than you get out without complaint. Home Depot doesn't promote base off good work skills."
good,"It's not a healthy place to work, constant dust, no air conditioner during summer and no heat during winter. Had a black mold issue which took them a year or more to handle. Their teaching skills need improvement. They expect you to know your department thorough a computer screen instead of giving some on-hand class with an experienced associate. Co-workers were good at help with unsolved questions and some had a very friendly personality."
good,A mostly fast-paced work environment with room to grow. I was not to impressed with the way management conducted disciplinary actions with disrespectful employees. Worked with my weekday schedule but not so much with weekends. Very expensive benefits packages also.
good,"It was okay. Work experience wasn't all that. Managers seemed to be uneager and ready to move on with their careers. Supervisors were okay. Some were honest and straight forward , others were egotistic and sketchy. The best part or working here was working over night stock."
good,Pay is not the best and the pay raise aren't good. I worked there for five and got a toal raise of $1.25 every one get the same percent on raises dose not matter if they work hard or not. The lazy works get special treatment like little babies if they don't want to do a job they will be given something easier to do and the hard works will have to take on that task after completing their own.
good,This job was fun because the customers were very friendly and some employees were also helpful. I got to learn new things in different departments.
good,"Overall, working at Home Depot isn't the worst place in the world. I learned a lot about myself and others around me. I also was able to experience new tools and learned things that I probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to in another industry. The management looks at you like they want to help you succeed, but has empty promises when put to the test. Job schedule MUST be flexible and they work you opening one day and closing the next with little to no consistency unless if you're considered a part time employee."
good,"As I walked through halls going to meetings/lunch/etc... I saw many stressed faces.  Many departments with which I interacted worked hard, but did not balance with playing hard.  The field (i.e. stores/DMs/RMs) felt they knew better than us at the home office (which was often a valid feeling) and unnecessary time was spent trying to explain or get folks on board with home office decisions.  At times, it seemed we were not the decision makers, but workers doing whatever stores wanted.  The overall hierarchy seemed backwards."
good,You walk around on the floor and help people. It was tiring because of the coworkers - not the customers. It was a good part-time job for a short period of time.
good,Working at Home Depot allowed me to see a variety of ideas and thoughts for home improvement projects. It was educational.
good,"working for Home Depot was very nice. co workers were nice as well as their managers. it is a great place to work for when you are retired and want a job that works with tools, hardware, and all sorts of other appliances"
good,"A fun place to work with ample opportunity to learn, but management and training seems to be lacking. It is difficult for supervisors to be held accountable or hold their employees accountable. Feedback is not always welcome and it seems many departments are inadvertently working against each other."
good,Big Box experience. Loved my co workers and team. Great benefits. No support from Store Manager. I worked overnight so I did not like the hours.
good,"I am not one to worry about my job because I know I am a hard worker and stay motivated to do what's right. However in my experience at The Home Depot I unfortuanely witnessed three store managers get fired within 4 months of each other, I didn't base my ultimate decision for leaving on this but it did play a factor. "
good,Therre as a part time worker really did not enjoy. hard to get advancement in the company. pay was good but not for partime.
good,"Not enough hours, not allowed to move up, don't receive encouragement, only negative, rudeness from supervisors.  Should be allowed more room for growth for everyone interested, not just the 'favorites' that are allowed to 'hide' during their shifts while the rest of us are doing all the work."
good,"From helping customers, to unloading trucks , there always something to-do . I loved solving problems for people helping them get there project started to finished ,"
good,"It seems on the store associate side of things, it's the case of ""overworked and Underpaid"" Mandatory weekends unless you are on MET or At Pro. The turnover rate in my specific area is pretty bad. The Home Depot does a lot for the community, and I believe in the company, it just seems to be staffing as a big issue. Some people don't even get lunches because of the lack of coverage in their departments. They have great benefits and the Homer Fund in fantastic in helping employees in need, Team Depot does a lot of volunteer work. MET can be fun, but repetitive at the same time"
good,"Great environment to work slight inconvience Schedules are never accurate,make changes without notification, and lack of team work with lifting of merchandise, Managers are never available to help with customer and when they are available they are very rude.Departments are left unattended."
good,Mostly supportive management.  Interesting place to work.  Workplace politics runs pampant within the organization.  Most of the people were fun to work with.
good,"Help customers with projects, or help them pick out new appliances. Co workers are fun to be around and they help you learn about other parts of the store you may not be aware of. Air Conditioner barely works, very hot in the store, even customers complain."
good,Home Depot offers flexible schedules but inconsistent hours of work.  Very difficult if not impossible to get full time employment and benefits.
good,"Working at Home Depot was a fun experience. I learned alot in my time there. They reward their associates often for their hard work and their great customer service. Management in my opinion did their job for the most part, but was not good at solving issues within departments, especially between associates, and often played favorites. My most enjoying thing about working at Home Depot was working with some of the most awesome co workers. We were like a little family there and that made it enjoyable to come to work everyday."
good,"Managers were always in a bad mood. Some days would be easy and others would seem long because our managers would find anything to complain about. Co-workers were cool, some of them. Others created drama but  I guess that's everywhere now and days, but then I was like one of the youngest employees there and the older employees would start drama. The pay was not enough and did not seem like I was going to make more anytime soon."
good,It's a high school masking it's self as a business. Favoritism and qued pro quo the gamut. Management picks the rules they'd like to enforce and on who'd they like to enforce it on at their whim. But this is just this particular building. I'd hope the entire company isn't run this way.
good,The pay is low for all the time and effort you age to put into the job. Part timers hours vary so future saving can be hard. Management did not see eye to eye with basic needs of employees.
good,"Good atmosphere for customers and associates, but difficult to keep accountability. If something doesn't get done or gets done incorrectly, it is very difficult to find from whom it originated. High turn over rate for associates (specifically in garden). Random scheduling makes planning anything awful (2-3 week schedule posted)."
good,"Registar takes some getting use to, fairly easy. Pay is alright. Meet a lot of new people. "
good,"I process counter walk up sales to contractors daily."
good,"I love working with the public.The Home Depot in Westminster had a problem with older people working in the store.The time I was there it seemed like they removed all the older employees.My co-workers were the best,they were so friendly and most of them are still very close friends."
good,The job is good but doesn't know pay enough. At times I am working multiple departments. My co-workers and I work as a team to get task done effectively and efficiently. The management team steps into help when we are short staffed. The hardest part of my day is when my Supervisors drop their work load on me with no help and still having me finish my work load. The job is actually more enjoyable when the supervisor is not there to put a heavy burden of my back.
good,My typical day includes answering customer's questions and making sure that they have found everything they need to complete their shopping experience.
good,Execute projects for vendors that supply Home Depot. The supervisors are strict on some safety rules but lenient on others. They all have their own opinions that contradict each other.
good,"Home Depot has striven to become the number one retailer in the world, and in so doing this, they have adopted a strategy that involves associates on the floor to help any and all customers they can find immediately. This helped me seek out customers as opposed to waiting on customers to find me with what they needed. It also made the interaction between customer and myself become much easier as it was clear to them that I wanted to help them and would go to any length to do just that."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Most customers are very friendly and appreciate your efforts which makes your job a lot more enjoyable."
good,"There isn't as much upward mobility as they make you think, management is very rude, and this should only be a temporary job at best."
good,"Supervisors with no formal or significant training on how to motivate, training or interact with employees.  Most management try to supervise by intimidation. Goals and bench marks are general and not specific for geographical areas and Shifts assigned (i.e. Sales in NY city are different than Atlanta or Miami or Chicago etc,) additionally part time employees and full time employees are gauged by same standard, part-timers work less hours and usually less productive hours of the work day."
good,"As far as working there, it was a job. They ask you to do things that could get you hurt and I did get hurt because my boss was too busy being everywhere else."
good,"Hours. Its all over the place. If you are part time, there is zero consistency in regards to hours. One week is full time, then no hours for a month. It does get busier during the spring-fall seasons so you can usually get 15+ hours a week depending on the department, but don't expect that to last into the Christmas season. "
good,"pretty chilled place, its good when you have the right management and the right co workers. ultimately just work and go home. doesn't pay very well though."
good,If your not one of Managements favorites their going to find a way to fire you for any reason. The company doesn't pay you what your worth with the knowledge you know.
good,I didn't like my experience in home depot . To much work little pay and no benefits. to much drama between management. their are not flexible with employees
good,"most of the time it was a good environment, but the managers did not know how to encourage workers to work more proficient , but if you stay long enough they do see you as a team but do not treat you as such"
good,rewarding position for the learning experience but very tough with rotating shift schedules makes it very difficult to have family time
good,"I would help customers with their project needs, help them get their whole project. mix paint. Daily reports, packdown and facing shelves."
good,"assist in unloading of trucks, counting and organizing incoming freight. staging to proper areas for distribution to stores."
good,"Good place to work for, but a little lean on the hours. How people survive on this job alone I'll never know. Co workers are great."
good,There were always trucks dropping off new merchandise so there was always inventory to be stocked. It was very easy to independently stay busy at this job.
good,"Nobody really ever knew what they were doing, Had to write reviews for the associates below me and they were always rewritten by the manager above me"
good,Management needs work but overall it's good work. Hardest part is the hours you work. I learned how to deal with customer and provide great costumer service. My co-workers were not all easy to work with but majority were. My most enjoyable part was stocking the merchandise and helping customers get the necessary materials for their specific project.
good,worked in the flooring department and it was fun to help others in need of fixing their homes or renevation projects customer service is always priorty
good,"Working with angry people, co-workers pass the buck, really don't want to work. they usually are young with not much work ethic. The hardest part was trying to fix the rental tools and take care of customers at the same time"
good,a place to work and grow if you like to work in construction and willing to work hard
good,Good company overall. Lots of machoism amongst the management staff.
good,"Its a great place to work at if your ready to bleed orange, the coworkers are awesome( if in the right dept ). they ask of you way to much for the type of pay they offer."
good,"My position with Home Depot was that of Lead Kitchen Designer. I would come in and assist customers with their every remodel needs.  Greet and assist customers in the aisles as well as down stocking, build displays and re-stock shelves and aisle maintenance.  I also had sales goals to meet and maintain as well as assisting the other designers in their roles and making sure all sales and designs were going smoothly.  Do not expect any help from management as they do not know how to perform your role. They just expect you to sell sell sell and do everyone else's job for them as well.  This is not everyones experience obviously but for six years it was mine.  Every job I applied for to advance myself would be denied as I assume I made the company too much money in the position I was already in."
good,at times the job can be over whelming due to poor scheduling of staff
good,"Management was lacking, virtually non existent."
good,"just stocked the selves, the co-workers were lazy, and the management was poor"
good,"a lot of good people.  I have learned about the do's and do not's of management.  hardest part of the job is that at the end of the day, nothing has truly been accomplished."
good,The customers were regulars and friendly. The job was demanding in the summer but became slow towards the fall which made the company start cutting hours.
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. You get a good grasp on customer service. Home depot is a good place to start if your a college student they are very flexible with your schedule.
good,Management played favorites and singled out employees they didn't like. Upper management did nothing to prevent or rectify behavors
good,"meeting new  customers daily "
good,"Troubleshooting and sales advice from an actual plumber is an invaluable service to the average DIY'er as well as the pro customers."
good,"The job was great. I learned how to create business processes for EDI transmissions. I learned a lot about the business systematically and the flow of Purchase orders, creating electronic documents, etc.."
good,"When I started HD was so into their ""values"" and mission statement that from the outside it seemed strange people. Now it's just a money machine for stock holders. Management doesn't care who they put where or what how they treat them."
good,"I unloaded trucks and put away all freight received. Worked overnight from 10 pm to 6 am. Management was great, corporate was not. I worked with a lot of good people at Home depot and they were the most enjoyable part ot the job. Hardest part of the job was the actual work itself. Very overwhelming at times."
good,"Store shows alot of favortism, good company for an older person i guess management is a joke"
good,"I was here while in college. I ran the inside and outside garden center. If you do not know anyone higher up be prepared to never advance. Very high expectations without hours budgeted to get the task done. Great benefits, but compensation is lacking."
good,"In working with this company, I leaned a great deal of deatails dealing with flooring and customer service. It helped me improve my communication skills and thinking for myself."
good,"A typical day would begin with searching for a first phone which is a necessity in my job. After wasteing maybe 20 min on that trying to figure out what the freight people did in the 1 Hour plus time they had ahead of me is another headache. Management does nothing to address this glut of do nothing time. My co-workers are a mix of hard workers, complainers who do nothing, plain old do nothing people and waste time managers. The hardest part of the day is trying to stay away for the people who enjoy wasting time.  The most enjoyable part is going home"
good,They treated me like an animal always had me doing all the lifting even when there were males around.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing return customer looking for my knowlege
good,Home Depot is a wonderful company decent benefits because they offer health insurance to part time employees. On the other hand working there it seems to drag on a daily basis and there is very little room for growth.
good,"great team "
good,"I was a lot attendant, and basicallt as a lot attendant you were required to do everyone elses jobs plus yours making nor nearly enough wages."
good,"Home Depot has a flexible schedule for part-time employees, also they offer promotion opportunities through hard work and dedication. I have learned almost everything there is to know about the business and what it takes to get to the next level in my career. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with work politics and how to adjust to different work related environments and constant change within the company. The most enjoyable part about the job are the success sharing parties."
good,"I worked on the overnight freight team.  Since the store was closed, it was a real laid back environment.  As long as we got out work done, then management had no problems with us."
good,"When I worked for Home Depot several years ago, the company had no concern for work/life balance."
good,"keeping the receiving area clean, cataloging inventory and load up customers with merchandise that was too big to hand it to them on the sales floor"
good,Overall I liked working there.  Co-workers were great and willing to help out any time I needed assistance with doing a task or assisting a customer.
good,"I learned a lot about how to stretch myself to my limits in the work I have to perform at this company. I gained many skills in customer service, money handling, having an eye for detail, multi-taking and meeting a lot of deadlines and quotas, as well as always being on the go and on my feet."
good,"Scanning and labeling items.Categorized merchandise by name, price and location. Rearranged items on display and restocked missing items. Monitored daily price changes in conjunction with a hand held price adjuster"
good,The company had bad leadership.you could never be late one minute or you get written up.
good,Not a fun place to work at ...management is to scripted and controlled by hire up management and they do not understand nor care what goes on in the store.
good,"its a terrible place, will schedule you 10 hrs per week, but want you to be all company"
good,"The associates working at home depot are great! The management and company policies need work. I never felt like my position was secure. Associates were either quitting before finishing training, or being fired left and right. Its almost like walking on egg shells around management."
good,"I would stock, clean aisles, find products and answer electrical questions to the best of my ability. I learned a basic understanding of residential wiring and small electronic installations. There was a lack of knowledgeable managers and during understaffed hours some questions only the main electrical associates could answer leaving some customers disgruntled. Not being able to find something for a customer the computer would say we had. Helping someone figure out a problem and learning along the way."
good,Never enough hours or resources to accomplish required tasks.
good,"It was an OK first job not what I expected, but would not work with school schedule."
good,"typically i go to work at 10pm over night until 5:30am. I work with my freight team to stock or all of the incoming merchandise for that day. Stocking merchandise and cleaning the store to look grand opening ready is my job. But, a certain ASM says i dont do work because i dont downstock or stripe overstock when the bays are full, which is not my job. Also the manager expects us to break down the freight pallets(which is recievings' job) and stock it all, so we are supposed to do double the work in less amount of time"
good,"Order product for shelves, stay in stock all the time, good customer service."
good,Its a great company to work for but the management was not professional and it caused a lot of conflict with coworkers.
good,"Its a fun place to work for, only because of the work crew I work with. Its a slow store and its hard for me to stand in one place."
good,"good job, poor treatment of temps.  work is easy to do. some of the per part staff are awesome, most of them are lazy.  due to being a temp can not get no bonus, but the per staff will evern though temps do the work too, and if not more of."
good,"Clocked in  helped others get registers going with money etc,  some new machines, co worker were nice,   some lifting, people."
good,"Awful pay, but good benefits with full-time positions. It's difficult to obtain a full-time position unless you are hired for it initially. They often give 40 hrs /week but consider it part-time."
good,"Remplir les tablettes vides, conseiller la clientèle"
good,This company offered the public good products at a fair price. Constant fluctuation of  management was disruptive to overall operations. Too many managers and not enough leaders. I did make some lasting friendships with co-workers.
good,"•	Oversaw stores install services Responsible for creating shrink plans for top shrinking items as well as auditing any vendor credit."
good,"A fun work placed that allowed you to work at your own pace, custmer were great to interact with and made helping them even fun. Associates were always willing to help when youdnt know something and will teach you what you dont know"
good,"Back in the day they cared about the employees. Now they try to find anyway to fire the employees that make good money or have been there long because of the changes they try to make to the workforce. If you notice that it's nuts that 3 people shouldnt only be the ones running a store at one time , well you have been there too long then. They fire and dont rehire and expect you to  make up the work of 5 people. The Managers sleep with associates and the company does nothing about it. It's not like that in every store but most in this area are like this. I merchandised 8 stores in this area and they all were basically the same. It's a shame. They use to be so good."
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work if you don't have a social life, family, or friends. There is times where you become slaves to management and don't receive even a little recognition. They care more about the customers money than the actual employees.The best part part of the job is all the pleasant customers you interact with on a consistent basis. The customers become apart of your family. Home depot isn't all bad but they really need to work on there management. It is very clear that everyone is out for themselves and will pull you back the moment you begin to strive forward. Future building while being a crab in a bucket."
good,"I haven't been here long, but I have been here long enough to observe this Home Depot form a distance. Considering that they do not have a store manager, all of the management employees and higher-up employees are ""fighting for power."" Most of the employees are very friendly but there are a few who are definitely not. You would think it wouldn't kill them to smile once in a while. As the summary reads, the management is very messy. Everyone is fighting to get on top and forgetting that they have a job to complete. It takes the head cashiers and higher-up employees way too long to perform certain tasks such as: bringing change increases, sending an available associate to cover another's shift when it is time to leave, and even allowing a few extra hours to those who need it. On that topic, I was told I couldn't pass 29 hours and was still denied getting at least 27. In my opinion, they are not as employee friendly as they promise to be. Other than that, the job itself is fine. It is more the environment that kills it."
good,"Home Depot was a good experience, it was a good place to work, it was not a good balance between work and home. I wish Home Depot did not abuse their salaried members of management such as 14 hour work days, they also could have respected the military veterans more, such as myself."
good,"It was pretty much fun. It was a couple cons about the job, but worked through it. Overall, it was a good experience"
good,"It was a job that was easy & organized, straight forward with the tasks that needed to be accomplished. The co-workers friendly and helpful. It got me the hours and pay that I needed with a set schedule that I could work."
good,"Typical day consisted of stocking shelves and helping guests find what they were looking for.  Management was alright, I didn't really have much interaction with them.  Co-workers were nice."
good,"This was a job where you would go into difference stores and make stuff look good, clean, setup new products, help customers, restock merchandise. More work than the in-store associates with less pay and even less appreciation. Not a great place to work."
good,"manage cashiers and the parking lot, learned management skills. My co-workers were friendly, manange the hardest part of the job was managing your friends."
good,It Was Good While It Lasted. With A High Turnover Rate Its No Wonder People Stayed There For Over A Year..
good,"Being an inventory associate was very routine. There was a daily action list that needed to be completed at the end of the week, pack down of item on the shelf twice a week and the scan out process twice a week. This was a very small group of us but I've learnt that not everyone is a team player or carry their own weight, no matter how small the group is."
good,"I have learned to sell household appliances in a manner that does not intimidate or pressure customers. I listen to the customer to learn what they are looking for so that I can go above and beyond to make sure they leave satisfied, while feeling they where heard. I enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is making sure every customer is completely satisfied with every part of their shoppping experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is that everyday is a new challenge."
good,"Enjoyed the people very much.  All complaints that I handled were submitted thru email, then I would designate where they went"
good,On a typical day at work i would find a forklift and immediately begin preparing my freight to load and ship. Ive learned how to work well with all types of people even in extreme working conditions. Management is not very genuine at this company and does not hire from within the company often. I love being in an active and productive environment where Im never bored.
good,"I really loved working here mainly because i love people. At The Home Depot you build relationships with regular everyday customers to the point where they would personally come in and look for me even if it they needed help in other departments. Co workers were great, I made many great friendships working here. The work schedules were very hectic at times. A lot of broken promises from management. Hardest part of the job manual labor. The most enjoyable part was meeting and interacting with all types of people."
good,"A typical day at work is restock merchandise on shelfs and walk the isles assisting customers find they're needs. Working at The Home Depot i learned a lot; How to deal with customers, and also about home improvement merchandise. Management overall is good they look out for employees the only con was the head store manager he was not much understanding. Hardest part of the job was working overnight shifts. The most enjoyable part of my job was when we would get a monthly reward like employee of the month."
good,This is a company that has no value for its employees. They tell you that you are the most important thing to the company and then one thing goes wrong and they fire you over something that makes no sense. They only recognize the workers that are slackers and the ones that work their hardest get no attention what so ever
good,"Pro's-they offer insurance, although it costs more than privatized. It's a job with a paycheck. Work with a great team of floor associates, while management is sub-par."
good,Overnight work can be overwhelming but the company did a good job of keeping moral up thru the night.
good,should be paid more for the type of work done here. management team needs more training. lack of advancement 
good,Everyday at work was different especially depending on the shift. Early mornings were sometimes slow at the beginning but usually picked up around 8:00 AM. Midday shift was kind of hectic because you came to work in the middle of chaos. The evening/closing shift was a lot smoother because things began to slow down. The hardest and scariest part of the job was sometimes assisting store security with catching a customer that was stealing. The most enjoyable part of my day was working with all my wonderful co-workers. Wish the job wasn't seasonal. I learned a lot about gardening and keeping your yard free of pest.
good,The Home Depot is a Corperate America nightmare. there is no room for advancement and they are trying to cut everyone to part time except for management. less benifits for them to pay.
good,"Clock in and go to a register, ring customers up and charge them. If they had a difficulty or had problems when shopping, i hear them out and try to help them out by asking a fellow associate to help them find what they are looking for. i want the customer to be satisfied with their shopping experience, and thank them as they leave."
good,The store and management were very disorganized. Most people didn't receive their 15 min breaks and given late lunches. The scheduling was very poor. They did not cohere to anyone's availability or request. Management very rude and unhelpful. Proper training is not given.
good,"Overall Home Depot was a great place to work, I honestly have nothing bad to say about the company..."
good,I just transferred to the Paint Dept. I enjoy the fact that is a busy department in the store and I can use my colors skills and decorating ideas. I am a very dynamic person with good Customer Service and management training due to my experience and training during my career.
good,"Check daily opening safety list. check notes to call customer with issued,call manufacture or vendor to solve customer problems.I find the need of my customers and to fulfill them. I worked alone without management supervision. Sometimes they give me a co-worker for me to train. The hardest part of the job is to do the work that my supervisor should be doing and cleaning up all the mistake of my co-worker from another shift. Inter action with customer and be able to help and convince them to buy at that time."
good,"Home Depot is not very family friendly. As a part-time associate, I have the ability to tell Home Depot what my availability is. However as a full time associate, you need to be available 24/7. Home Depot does not give employee discounts."
good,management wont meet your eyes when you talk. they are not very engaged in the front lines. they communicate only about store stuff and really do not appear to care about the ones who generate their bonus. peers vary from robust outgoing individuals to hide and seekers. a few seems genuine in wanting to improve the overall culture.still all in all its a butt kissing parade as real values are not recognized or rewarded. having the time tools and personnel to get things done is a constant struggle so having some team building skills is mandatory.
good,This was a sales job at a big box store. The training is top rate and prepares the employee for work on the sales floor.
good,"The Home Depot is a place that could be a great place to work. However, it was my experience that The Home Depot cares more about making a buck than they do in caring for their hardworking employees. The corporate office talks about living the Home Depot core values, but its not executed at the store level. Corporate is also creating new initiatives and programs to be executed on the store level. However, they do not consider the time these programs and initiatives take away from our sales force on the floor. They should refrain from doing things that have negative impact on the customer experience."
good,Flexible with schedule; no opportunities to advance beyond the register.Broken promises.
good,a typical day at work would be you clocking in walking your department for any messy areas and also looking for safety hazards. Then stocking out any mech while tending to customer until the end of the day.
good,the home depot changes its sops without any notice and no retrainning. And they only give you two days a year off pluse week ends.
good,enjoy being able to help customers to benefit to their best interest what will be to best value for there purchase. Providing good advice with regards to what they are trying to accomplish.
good,"Hours were horrible. You may have to close one day getting off at 12:00-1:00 at night, then have to open the next morning and be there at 6 am."
good,"Worked for Home Depot 7 years. The many days, hours, nights, over nights,was it worth it? Never saw my 2 youngest children grow up. Always at work. GAVE BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS FOR THIS COMPANY.Only to have them dump ME on the street. BEWARE OF WHAT YOU WISH FOR ,WITH A JOB FROM HOME DEPOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"After I started college, one of my coworkers quit; instead of asking the remaining Head Cashiers what shifts they could cover, management changed the schedule; often times with less than a 24 hour notice, if they notified the staff at all. My requests for days off were repeatedly denied, and I began to have coworkers asking me if I was loosing weight (which I was from lack of sleep and personal time)."
good,Extremely physical work. Absolutely no down time allowed. Stressful beyond belief.
good,management was ok very hard to make happy wasnt very forgiving when needed to change hours. wanted to do others peoples work on top of my own work
good,Although i did enjoy my time at home depot i do feel as though it could have been better. The management team was not the greatest but they managed to keep things afloat for awhile. I loved having a wide variety of tasks to perform as well as having a large team of coworkers to help and support me
good,ok company to work for. I've learned alot working for homedepot. management is ok. co workers are ok. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers.
good,"The customers and their overall experience is important to me. It is to all of us.A typical day is as it is everyday, all about the customer and giving them the best experience possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers , and my team mates who are like family."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, and enjoyed my health benifits. Thats the only good thing I have to say about this company. The management sucks!"
good,stocking product to floor for sale. Management has all say and no input from employees at certain stores. Hardest part was learning where everything goes with no direction or input as to how it should be stocked. Enjoyable part was time to learn on own time in store about tools and products
good,Stayed busy at work managind the front end.
good,After 12 years as top sales....no respect ...Loved the people...the hours were a little out of wack as far as health goes
good,22 years of great service to this company.
good,Most enjoyable part of job was watering the plants in the Garden Department and talking with customers about plants. The hardest part of the job was working outdoors in 100+ temperatures.
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to gain valuable experience and the company experience is very strong. The store experience can be quite draining and should not be considered a long term career. Frequent leadership changes lead to changing values, and you have to be able to keep your head on a swivel to keep up--or you will be gone."
good,needs to get rid of the seasonal work and part time work so the company could make it better for the consumers and make it better for the employees.the co-workers were good to work with managers were ok but needed to stand up for there employees instead of wallets.there bonus might have been a little smaller if they would of stood up for the employees.and not kiss the company azz
good,"es buena empresa, aprendi a que de todos podemos aprender algo bueno o malo y de ahi que tomamos y desechamos"
good,"Five store managers in eight years should give some indication as to the lack of stability in this company. After over 6 years in the Doors and Windows where I was promoted to based on my work history as a carpenter I was forcefully moved to the Paint Department where I have no professional experience. In the paint department I had a lot to learn in order to function effectively on top of all the supervisory duties. They don't give you extra time to do all the learning and they expect you to train new people so it becomes impossible to get everything else done. Me having so much to learn along with training others, daily tasks and other supervisory duties coupled with virtually no real support from management made it impossible for me to succeed. Management is also very contradictory with requirements and expectations: They’d tell me I couldn’t expect to get everything done myself and I had to get my whole team involved. With my entire department being new people in need of training I had to partner with other willing supervisors to make things happen. Management would then tell me I relied too heavily on others to get my work done. I worked overtime and partnered with other supervisors along with my own associates in order to accomplish more in less time. I also developed a work list and schedule to help my associates stay on track with what needed to be accomplished. I opened this store 8 years ago & proudly did my job better than recent management ever gave me credit for & I certainly deserved better treatment than I got."
good,"A typical work day includes assisting customers, cleaning my work area, ordering special doors for customers, and assisting customers by telephone.I have gained knowledge on the interior and exterior maintenance of homes. My direct manager was professional and taught me what i needed to know. my co workers were unprofessional at times, but tolerable. The hardest part of my job was lifting the heavy material and the most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers."
good,"Hardest part of this job was having to fill in at other Dept's when you had stuff to do in your own dept. Why ? lack of personel, and people calling off work."
good,"This job taught me alot of things such as home building materials, i obtained several heavy lift machine licenses, as well as how to be a great customer service rep to shoppers."
good,typical work day is over worked and under appreciated.
good,"It took 2 years to become a head cashier, the hours aren't enough, always weekends. Managers always seem to hide when associates need assistants."
good,Good group of co-workers
good,It wasnt a great place to work. I did absolutely nothing all day.
good,"Customer Service was overall, just interesting; however management is unstable. The Department completely political. The good thing is, you can expect a department-wide break/party every 2 months..."
good,"The management is good, but isn't exactly the best. They are stingy with their hours as well as their money. Only thing i like about working there is the benefits are cheap and they cover really well. But honestly you're better off working at mc'd and getting more hours then they do and the home depot."
good,Home depot is a good company. They really do train and develop you. If there is something that you dont know they will train you to know. You learn from everyone. Its hard for you to be noticed in home depot unless you are close with the management team.There policies are not always for the people of the company. It more based on sales and numbers. They may care to train you and develop you but once you are trained you tend to drop to the waste side if you are not in managements favor You do gets bonuses as whole and it get divided between the whole store.
good,Its an okay place to work but home depot don't care about their associates like they say they do and the only way you move up is if u kiss up to them...i been there for years and never moved up not once but they always wanted me to train new people but never wanted to move me up because they felt i wasn't ready...smh..
good,"As with any big-box retailer, there will be rotating shifts, hours and personnel. They will match your previous employers' wage, however, advancement is purely at the discetion of management. If they ""like"" you, they will promote you over more qualified and experienced applicants. And don't bother complaining or raising concerns about anything, it will only put you on their ""short"" list and all you will get is lip-service."
good,"working at the store level is quite repetitive no matter where you are. Management has double standards, so what they say should be taken with a grain of salt, they will stab you in the back. The Hours are awful. They happily have you get off at 10PM and expect you to be in at 6AM the next morning."
good,"Other job seekers should know that in the beginning it may seem like it is hard or a lot of work, but it really is not. When you get a routine and stick with it then it will become very easy to do."
good,Management communication is poor. All associates are hired as seasonal and don't expect to get a part time or full time position right away. They schedule to fit a student in college schedule.
good,Management needs to stay put long enough to make positive changes.The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Bad communication between management to associates and departments. Extremely high turn over rate for Delivery Department 94. All end up quitting or transferring to other departments due to the stress and chaos. Did learn to operate machinery though since all is required in that department.
good,There isn’t any room for future growth.    The workplace culture in the store I worked in was sub par.   The work environment reflects in the treatment of customers
good,"At the beginning the company was great and worked really well with you as an associate but as time goes on they don’t care much about you as an associate and only worry about how the customer’s are feeling. They are also ignorant to associates if they don’t get credit cards and there is a lack of communication between associates and managers. But they work well on scheduling and making sure you have time for other things in life. If you are able to get credits the majority of the time and do your job exactly they way they want you too, you’ll do good in the company."
good,Retail company with rapid changes to personnel and staffing. Always pressured to reach near impossible quarterly goals. Staff are often pushed to limit
good,"I made history in theat company and i felt like my direct management didnt approve for some reason, deducted my hours and it forced me to find another job."
good,"If you're ever diagnosed with an illness that causes you to be in the hospital, they still give occurrences (points against you for being absent). Corporate doesnt care either. I've been dealing with this for 2 years now."
good,"The management at my location is mediocre and the employees aren’t treated fairly even when it’s been brought up to a higher authority, no changes are made to the internal issues."
good,I started working at Home Depot earlier this year and found most associates very friendly. A lot of  managers not so much. Very two faced. There is a gentlemen who works there with an acquired brain injury. He does very well all things considered as I've seen people who have brain injury's who can't do what he is capable of doing. What amazes me the way the mangers have treated him since I've been there. A manger threatens him because he can't remember how to do a certain task. If he has a learning disability because of his brain injury then you should not be threatening him.  They moved him to another department because of that and caused him a lot of stress. Not professional and not a way to treat someone who has a disability especially when you say you support people who have disability's. I almost wanted to call human rights.
good,overall the company was sloppy and didnt care too much about the workers such as the lot attendants. usually over worked and never really trusted with the break times given to us.
good,The Home Depot it’s a strong company and is doing well in these uncertain times when many retailers are going out of business. Their sales culture is very aggressive people fear for their job siftarsecurity if they do not complete their goals
good,"not flexible with schedule, management was not very nice, but most employees were nice, and the brakes given were good and fair, eveything else was average."
good,got lied to when hired worked long hours no over time. was part time went home at late hours. was the stores 6 forklift drivers. never liked anyone who was rude.
good,"Typical day at work would be to evaluate products I was going to produce for render spins."
good,"You are ALWAYS on your feet except when you are on break or lunch.  They provide a lot of support for their employees like tuition fees counselling etc. also they give treats to their staff like pizza or hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches & fruits. Nice environment."
good,"Working at home depot was better than fast food. Same pay, less mess, learned a LOT more, and there is some opportunity for advancement, at least when I was there almost a decade ago. Started as a cashier, worked into flooring and paint before I left. Safety and customer oriented workplace which I respected and enjoyed."
good,Good job but not very understanding. Had daycare issues and talked to them about and they said one thing then did another.. best part of job was making customers happy
good,Not bad for a beginner. It is a good start but not reliable enough to make a living unless you get promotions. The environment was good and comfortable but the management could not keep the employees happy.
good,Not a good company to give your all too.. you will not be compensated decently & if  you ask during your reviews management will utilize everything except your work ethics to deny you
good,It'a an ok place to work. It's just not the place for me to work. The benefits are excellent. It's just not enough hours given per wekk unless you are a supervisor or management.
good,"You wont be making a lot of money, however you will get flexible hours and the work isn't hard. the company works to help its employees, which is nice, but the stores are a mess and they will hire a lot of people that can't or won't do their job."
good,"Management is a joke, employees do not respect one another. They give supervisors titles to employees who can’t even do the simplest of task like delegating. Great company when it comes to the benefits and bonuses. But the respect and advancement is little to none."
good,The benefits are very poor they do not do advances in between the company.. lots of people worked there for over 10 years and were not permanent or full time
good,Management never focuses on the little people it’s all about the people at the top. A lot needs to be changed at Home Depot but it’s definitely starts with management and I wouldn’t recommend someone to work there.
good,"I was an Appliance Specialist,and learned a lot. I only wish I had better support from upper management.  If you want to grow with a company,the employee and employer need to mesh."
good,Being retail the schedule is never the same so if you like a schedule that is rotating it is good. But being older person I like a steady schedule. The pay verse experience is not good but is tolerable.
good,"The work itself was fine, I actually enjoyed it. It's great store side and MET side for younger people not afraid to put in a little elbow grease for an okay. That being said, for the amount of work expected vs how much you are paid and recognized for is complete opposite (MET side.) The pay was no where near what it should have been for the MET team. They are paid the same as employees who were ALWAYS understaffed pulling the MET team away from doing their own duties which were sometimes unreasonable. When the starting pay jumped up, the people that have been busting their butt working their way up for years were not compensated fairly, they were just given what everyone else got which was very discouraging. Raises ranged from 10-25 cents before that so it takes a LONG time to get any recognition. Unless you were liked or have been there 20+ years, then you get a homer badge (bonus) every month, it rarely ever had anything to do with work ethic. The rules and policies are all there, but in my experience, very few ASMs or MODs actually care to follow through because they get paid plenty regardless and the store will make enough."
good,"There are some great people working at Home Depot and they made me want to go to work.  The store managers either make or break the employee's efforts, attitude and loyalty.  Unfortunately while I worked there, the initial store manager who was fabulous and inspired employees got replaced and things were never the same.  Even customers noticed the difference.  The pay is not enough to get employees to put up with it."
good,"There is no advancement in kitchen design, there are no incentives for selling as a kitchen designer. Training is online monthly but vendor PK is seldom. No one else knows what you do, so none else can help you. Which also means no one is hovering. The culture is like High School; a popularity contest. I keep to myself and make sure I am teaching myself through practice and great customer service."
good,"80% of the day is slow and intermittently sparsed with small bursts of people. The only issue is the amount of standing still you ultimately do. Cashiering is a lot of standing but the floors are concrete and the ""mats"" they give you to stand on are so old it's not very helpful. Some of the management are stellar but majority are embroiled in their own conflicts. Recommend staying to yourself as much as possible."
good,"Good for the stater and mum. Poor pay for the job they ask. I am thankful to have job"
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot, but, there was no schedule consistency, and, there were weeks that you would only work 20 hours, but, work 4 or 5 days a week."
good,"Nothing special. It is a hardware store. Does not pay the bills. I was a white female foreigner with a strong accent. Costumers would never believe me, even though I studied incessantly and still know everything. Just ask me any question about paint, I've got it. The chauvinism from clients was horrible, so I had to prove myself every second of my shifts. Overwhelming. People would ask questions to the most stupid person of the department because it was a male and ignore me, until he himself would ask me for help. In the beginning was fine but after a couple years it sucks your energy. Besides having a degree in Legal Studies nobody ever offered me any advance even though I was running a department by myself when everybody else quit or was fired. As soon as they hired new people they reduced my hours. I talked to management, and they ended giving me full time after weeks of waiting. Every review I would hear was basically ""You are the sunshine of this company, you are our customer service queen, you are the light, starts and the blue of the ocean and you are super duper promotable' just to give me a 25 cents raise in the end of the conversation. Unfortunately sugar does not pay bills and I just ended staying there for a long time because my husband has a decent job and I liked my coworkers. I asked to go back to part-time again after having children, because by the time the schedule was impossible to balance personal life with work. I ended going back to school and could not handle anymore."
good,The job is ok but the pay makes it hard to stay we do a lot of work and it dose not reflect in the pay checks so I am looking to bring my time and Talents elsewhere
good,With better management the store could be a lot better. It's a lot of work for not too much pay but some of the workers are very friendly so its good.
good,you there for only a short time an your replaceable. they don't want anyone to think there is any future in the company. its a job for the young and old.
good,The best thing about Home Depot are the benefits.  The low wages do not help with a lot when it comes to the cost of living.  A lot of stress on the body and mind.  A few people actually work hard while everyone else slacks.  The new manager that has taken over for the manager that transferred out is not qualified.
good,"Es una empresa muy formal y se podria decir qu3 paga bien en cuanto vida personal nunca me gusto que se involucraran tanto,te apoyan si en caso de ser necesario y depende del caso el personal hay que tener cuidado."
good,day to day work helped me greatly improve my customer service but management was poor. I was able to gain great team skills but pay was poor for amount of workload.
good,You have the good with the bad. Most of the time the coverage is bad. You'll definitely love the people you work with. Trying to become full-time takes a lot of time and hard work.
good,i was at home depot for six months and the work space that i was in was very toxic. home depot advertised there work space as something that its not. they let me go for something called over employment.
good,"We were overworked and given to many tasks for a short amount of time with little pay, can barely get a day requested off, expectations are to demanding"
good,It was alright but i found it hard to get atraight answers and equal treatment from my managers and co-workers most of the time. Other than that getting to help a customer be more confident with their project is always fun.
good,Average work environment. Salary low for what you’re required to do on a daily basis. I did gain some knowledge however. Things could be way better and pay should be way better for sure! The juice is not worth the squeeze!
good,"I loved working there until I went to day shift.   Management is unreasonable and not in control of things.   Only really care about you when u do something wrong and need to be written up...no positive attitudes, just constantly looking for problems to complain about"
good,"Started out as part time with the promise of being moved to full time. After a year of not being moved they moved me and promoted, unqualified people."
good,Depends on management!   The store manager sets his expectations or lack of.....I have stayed for so many reasons but ready to move on.....retail is not for me!
good,"As an hourly associate the company if fantastic . Well paid , great benefits, hours based on requested preferences. In a management capacity as a manager I was paid less than male managers in the same role and asked to work additional hours for events that male members of the management staff were not made to attend or assist with . I was forced out of my position unfairly"
good,"You work in multiple departments when they have no coverage/need help, you are thrown into different task. Management  suck some don't even do anything but micromanage you.Their communication between them is horrible they dont even like each other(and it shows)and the management only look out for workers that they like.They have they favorite. And pls dont get hurt on the job they will  Fire you if you don't play ball"
good,"Company has corporate training, programs to get employees involved and excited about their job.  No employee discount is offered.  Some areas are harder work than others.  Very Corporate driven."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with your favorite coworkers. The hardest part is having to deal with angry customers. Busy store so you're having to move around a lot.
good,"Great job for retired person or student."
good,Too many people felt as though they were in charge. Took me a month to figure out everyone's role in the store. Too much bickering between employees. Too much competition between managers. Seemed as though everyone was out to get someone. I hated the drama every day. I am sure that the culture wars started at the top of the local store. I am not into drama.
good,Working here was like being a cop and treatment by managers is horrible. They’re a lot of contractors you have to deal with that stink and are uneducated and rude. If your working inside the store they’re is always gonna be someone watching you. The only thing they care about is if you get credit cards if you don’t it’s like you didn’t do anything.
good,"The home depot."
good,"Always busy, good people to work with, Unfortunately you're not allowed to get enough hours and will need additional work,  But other than a few Personality differences, I enjoyed working there."
good,"Can be a great job if you have great blinders. If you get irritated easily, this isn't the place for you. Management pushes the people who actually work to do more while the slackers stand around collecting a paycheck. Teamwork and moral is mostly low due to the fact nobody is held accountable."
good,"It was a dependable job I always got the job done I was just ready for a new job experience with someone else, I been theiralmost a year an it was time for change"
good,Unfortunately at this location they really just dont have it right when it comes to employee satisfaction. You can go above and beyond in your roll but dont expect management to even say thank you for your efforts.
good,"It's all about the Depot. The Home Depot constantly preaches about the welfare of the associate being just as important as the business. They talk of associates having a life and family is important to them. They'll talk about their inverted pyramid (you'll see if you work there), values wheel, etc. It's just a line. If management speaks about it enough, you might actually believe it and drink the orange koolaid. THD is not a bad company to work for. Just always have in the back of your mind that it's all about the Depot. Expect an average raise of no more than $0.25 per year. Don't think about the cost of living because they pay you less.  I have been scheduled to work 2pm-11pm then had to come back the next day and work 6am-3pm because it suits the business. I have also requested to work these exact same back to back shifts for personal reasons, only to be told that it's against policy. Why? Because it's all about the Depot . Your health and wellbeing matter, just not all the time. There are many other instances I've experienced that backup this idea. Bottom line, look after yourself because they won't."
good,"Most of the people I worked with at Home Depot have quit or been fired. Even people that replaced them have been fired or quit. "
good,This company has given me many opportunities to advance and learn more about different departments! They have been generous with scheduling around my school hours.
good,"Ethical and code of conduct from some supervisors belittling part time workers.  Business code of conduct from certain supervisors should be dealt with in a private area not on SALES FLOOR.  Co workers or other part time workers work well together, but you sure did know who was power stricken certain supervisors.  Enjoyed upper management"
good,Working at Home Depot is very labor intensive and requires you to have a basic understanding of most home renovation departments. Depending on what department you worked in you had to be trained to use many different vehicles to be able to do what was expected of you.
good,"you do not have much chance of growth in Security in management. .  nice place to work and people are fine.  in security you meet every one and  get to know the associates on the floor."
good,I wouldn’t recommend working at the Towson store. The store is poorly managed and the store manager won’t promote his people So they can grow within the company. The ASM’s (Assistant managers) aren’t nearly as bad as the store manager. They care about their jobs and spend time with associates and customers. The store manager only goes out on the floor to assist customers when his bosses are there.
good,"Es una empresa que mantiene política de puertas abiertas, as actividades las disfruto mucho muy recomendable."
good,"The ground position is good, but very difficult to move up. Great co workers makes you feel like in a big and welcoming family. Great for a part time never for a career."
good,"The work is hard and the pay is ok, but it doesn't quite match up to the amount of responsibility and tasks assigned to the associates. If you're working there part time, I would still look for better opportunities if I were  you."
good,"Co workers were amazing, some department supervisors are lazy and hide from work . I Was lied to when I got hired and when my temp status was done, the GM Lied so it was just one lie after another after another. Don’t plan on ever getting full time some people have been there years and don’t have full time and want to work full time."
good,The company as a whole is a great company however the work life at individual retail stores is a hit or miss.  The one I currently am employed at is without a doubt a toxic one.  Just beware of your environment; the company as a whole is good.
good,A normal place to work. You have to learn alot to work there although you dont need to know much just have to go through the classes that they put on  the computer.
good,"Way too many people trying to run the show. Low pay, understaffed. If they paid better, they wouldn't have such a staffing issue. Turnover is rampant."
good,"I enjoyed everything about working here except the 15¢ annual raises, starting at $10, nearly mandatory weekend shifts, and no real opportunity for advancement.  Even if you were promoted they only made a couple dollars more an hour.  Which hardly seems worth the extra work."
good,Management was decent and helped out when you had a issue. Work load was fairly light and the training was great. They feed you lunch all the time. Staff room was nice with tv and game consoles.
good,"very stressful, not enough employees to help with customer and store need. i enjoyed the team spirit we had 2 times a yr and the company parties. we received bonus"
good,"My experience with working at Home Depot was not that bad. It is not a place to work at if you are shy. You will have a lot of customer action and talking and coworkers. You will learn how to sell credit, deal with money and debit cards and Home Depot cards. It is a bit intimidating at first but once you get that hang of it, it is a good first job. I recommend trying out Home Depot. Your managers are friendly and always on site if you need them."
good,"My experience is one of many, but at least from the store that I came from everyone feels unappreciated. Yes, you have the people you work closest to that help you out and you also have people in other departments that will also help out. Those people are greatly appreciated. As for management at the store that I worked at, good luck to everyone that is still there. You have a store manager that knows absolutely nothing about the store and she goes around proudly letting her associates know that she doesn’t know or need to know how to use a register; please tell that to your customers when there are massive lines and your registers aren’t adequately staffed. And of course if she has a customer in front of her she will find someone to pawn the customer off on because once again she knows nothing or she just doesn’t want to be bothered. Then you have one of her managers that is basically a bully and two faced. You definitely can’t leave out  the other two assistant managers that don’t do much to help anyone. Honestly they say they switch out store managers every two years, well this one is long overdue because she should have been taken off her position the moment she stepped foot into that store."
good,I was thankful for the job offer. and have like my time there . the work on freight is hard but working midnight shift makes it a little better. rest of the crew is great
good,"Learn a lot about home improvement "
good,"The management doesn’t communicate well at all amongst each other, they expect us to know what they want when they want. The co workers talk about each other in negative ways."
good,I worked in the back as a freight team associate and ever time I would pull a pallet into the store people would ask me for someone in whatever department they were in and I would go to the front desk just to find out there is no one in that department. This happened just about every night in just about all the departments.
good,"had ok position, recognized for good work with pat on back but not salary increase. Manager was considering my promotion then he was transferred and I was back to square one. Positions are mostly part time so company avoids paying benefits"
good,The Home Depot is a great place to work. Just the fully flexible schedule that’s non-negotiationable was starting to not enable me to remain doing my fatherly duties
good,"Home Depot tries its best to promote the idea that all the employees are a part of the same team of family. however, employees often prefer to look after themselves rather than their fellow co-workers. The pay is decent, but between tension amongst co-workers, and a fast-paced environment with demanding customers, it can start to wear down on you."
good,I would check in freight as I unloaded trucks and staged freight in the proper departments. the freight personal would then break down pallets an restock shelves. the excess freight would then placed in the over head spaces. We would then clean  the store.
good,The job wasn't that's bad it just wouldn't give any one hours and when they did give hours it was back breaking work for 11.50$ an hour on top of that most of the time I wasn't even allowed a lunch
good,"All was well at first but they don’t reward the good one, the rather reward the bad workers but the hard working individual don’t get much recognition but in all it has been a decent job but definitely not a longtime Career"
good,Pay starts at minimum wage and doesn't stray far from there afterwards. The people who work there are good people and generally want to provide the best customer experience they can. I haven't worked there for a few years and still consider many my friends.
good,"very stressful, obligated hours to work, no set hours, everyday will vary. Management wont stand by you. Crazy hours. Poor customer service. No advancement to next level positions unless managers like you."
good,"I had a less than stellar time working at Home Depot, there are many age restrictions for departments that have no reason to be restricted, as well as many in management who are out for themselves more than anyone under them, and would gladly throw them under the bus in order to keep their job.  That is only a few managers there, though, many in management and supervisory roles tend to care about their employees."
good,"Easy to be released on impulse, despite prior good reviews.  No allowance for normal religious worship. Forget holidays. Some managers lack leadership of fairness."
good,Working for the Home Depot was fun but with very little pay and horrible hours I couldn’t support myself or my family. Also the pay raises I got were insulting at just around 8 cents.
good,"Work was fast pace"
good,"it seems to me that the employees there expected to lift more then your suppose on your job ,title.  The managers had there favorites and you had to work up to there expectations or they talk about you."
good,"Job is easy as walking, the management takes things farther than needed too for what the expectation of getting the job done requires. its a really simple laid back position but trying to progress within the company or ever get full time is a pain."
good,Was a new experience for me. Which taught me a lot about favoritism and lack of acknowledge people who actually work over who your are cool with or not.
good,"As a company, HD is a good place to work, however, the store that I worked at is not a good work environment. Management there does not seem to really care about it's employees, only the bottom line. It is a very stressful work environment and nearly all of its employees want to quit or be relocated."
good,Managers will bend over backwards for some people and then kick others out the door. Seen multiple people get fired or written up for same things others done for months and months absolutely terrible
good,"The managers are what make the company not worth the job, the amount of favoritism there as well as negativity is beyond what I’ve ever experienced. Benefits are truly the only pro."
good,I had never had a job before the home depot. They provided me with great training and an even better example of what not to do. Most workers are lazy and jaded. Workers are underpaid students who stay because the hours are decent. Everyone is stretched too thin and now properly compensated for the work they do. I stayed for too long because I really enjoyed some of my co-workers and my position at the service desk. When minimum wage went up I learned that new employees where being paid 25 cents less than me after 5 years. I spoke with the managers and they just shrugged and said that's how it goes so I left for a better paying job.
good,Just the type of place where u got your job assignment and basically was left at it I long as as u made your quote u was good for and in a way that's what I liked about the job
good,"Nice people and our old manager used to be cool. New manager and his assistant are shady , they lie and do what’s convenient for them. They bring up rules and say things you haven’t ever heard and try to use it against you when it doesn’t add up to what they want. There’s rats. Receiving area is beyond dusty and not a healthy/safe environment to work in; my breathing has become worse because of it. My employees is what makes it bearable and fun ."
good,Overall it’s a pretty cool job but like in everything there’s politics involved! Just go to work do your job & go home. Just know that when they realize your a great worker they’ll put extra work on top of the work you have already without more pay and don’t dear have anything to say about it
good,"Home Depot is a fun place to work for there is a sense of team work, but salary and hours are not enough.  I couldn't live on the hourly salary and the lack of hours.  Home Depot is the type of company that hires part timers to avoid benefits. I enjoyed my short time there, but I wouldn't recommend working there if you have to live based on their salary"
good,"I worked there for 11 years. Met a lot of great people. Management changed, favoritism was on the rise, as management could choose who would get in trouble and who could be saved.y managers in the beginning were great, but my last few years were terrible. No back up, no support. It was pretty pathetic."
good,"I learned a lot at Home Depot in the lumber department. I learned about wood for decking, building homes, projects, roofing and other departments in the store. I received a forklift license, how to unload and load trucks. Opening and closing of the lumber department, based upon the shift. I learned to work the skill saws. How to assist customers and met an athletic celebrity or two, which was good. I worked all the time, where I lost 48 pounds, to show how hard and intensity I put forward. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy lumber when I worked a shift alone and the easiest and most enjoyable was helping customers. I also had self-learning assignments monthly and had to pass a test after 5 months on the job regarding my position and other departments in the store."
good,I been with Home Depot for about 3 years now and it use to be a. Good company until they started adding more rules and less pay with the amount of work they give you in the daily.
good,Too many chances to get written up not enough hours and management that didn't seem to care about you. Which seems to be a reoccurring issue. But it wasn't as bad as Steak N shake due to stress.
good,"Fast paced, sometimes no assistance,  multi-tasking a must, ???managers???  Some supervisors were great,  others were very critical and not so supportive."
good,Being able to make available every product that home depot provides from hard ware to building materials to painting products and lumber materials and water heaters and so on
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Home Depot. I really liked my coworkers working in the Hardware Department. Yes, it was challenging at times when the Pro's came in..."
good,Hire people who have sales experience and like to work.  My experience at Hempstead store no opportunity to go full time with better paid.  That’s why I work for Lowe’s better pay and steady schedule
good,This is a basic job with little room for advancement. Everyone there is very clicky. Feels like High School. The pay sucked but the schedule was good management sucked.
good,"Assisting customers with returns and orders. Fast paced, but I enjoyed the interaction with customers.  Management was not supportive of your schedule.  The pay did not match the work out put."
good,"The breaks were really short and provided no time to eat (15 minutes). Hours fluctuated. Little opportunity for advancement as they hired outside people to become head cashiers instead of promoting existing employees. For female cashiers, there are co workers and customers that are very inappropriate. Overall, the job is pretty easy for the pay. You really just had to show up on time to keep your job."
good,"Not the best job but a job is a job. Friendly co workers but if you find better, please take. Poor management. Low pay for high customer service, knowledge, and heavy lifting."
good,"The managers bring their at home problems to work and treat everyone like s*#t just cause they are having a bad day. I'm the only person that does packdown at our store and never have any help and have to get an 8 hour job done in 4-5 hours. We got perfect scores for three months on packdown from corporate and they thanked the crew and manager , when no one every did it but me, I even do the managers bays. It's not worth the pay. I make less then people that have been there for less time then me."
good,"My main occupation is only a 10 month job, so for the summer I need to maintain employment for two months of the year. Home Depot Hired me very quickly, and I was very happy that thay did  because most employers wouldn't. The pay was low and I was only allowed to work 30 hours a week, but it was better than not having anything at all. I enjoyed working with everyone there, they were very supportive. My co-workers helped me build knowledge and confidence in selling products that I knew very little about.  I loved being engaged with the customers, helping them with products, and learning alittle about them. Every day was different from the last and exciting."
good,My direct supervisor was not good with stress and made it not fun anymore. There is a culture of not following through on the company's mission statements with treating employees with respect the bottomline is the most important thing.
good,"management was good."
good,"The Home Depot is a solid employer priding itself on employee retention. The company does not really offer advancement opportunities for its associates nor does it provide competitive compensation for longevity. While there are supposed to be annual raises based on performance, it's up to the manager and in-house HR to provide it. More often than not, they ""forget"" about it and never assign these raises in a timely manner."
good,"Scheduling was up and down with hours, communication between Managers and Supervisors needs work, a lot of gossip and favoritism within the store. At first it wasn't a bad place to work but there is quite a bit of drama for a hardware store."
good,"Everyday I am told the store is a team.  When help is needed it never or rarely shows up and then when work doesn't get completed, you get in trouble. I am expected to act as a supervisor when I am not one.  I am expected to solve issues that I am not comfortable with and when I do not fix issues that a manager or supervisor should I get  told to basically take care of it next time or it still gets pushed back to me.  If I make mistakes because I did those tasks then I get in trouble."
good,"Even though I enjoyed working at Home Depot, management obviously had favorites and it was very difficult to see other people advance and grow that weren’t capable or were 1-3 months new also very frustrating when supervisors acknowledge your leadership and customers asking if you are the manager but not your main manager or she probably did but was scared I’d probably take her place. Very hard to communicate with those types of people. They have a little bit of I wouldn’t say power but make more money than you and they think they are god."
good,After 5 years i was victim of an inept supervisor and big brother like management. She literally hid from conflict. Had no backbone and lied to customers. You can go as high as you want with HD but be prepared to kiss some butts to get there. They do not want to do as well as they can. They contract everything out so cannot  pay employees that well.
good,This job is a great first job if you want to make a lot of money and get stronger at the same time. Otherwise you may feel overworked and the chain of command will delay your own personal workload.
good,Was part-time but kept getting promised full time and a promotion but it never happened. Left for a full time job. Only basic training and you felt like you were on your own.
good,"no one knows what the otherones was doing, each seft did what they wanted and never talked to eachother, managemnet took what any customer said over workers,"
good,Management was there but did not really care for employees. The environment was dreary. Workplace was moderately safe but lacked education on equipment use.
good,"Inconsistent work schedule for most employees. I earned only a few dollars over minimum wage even after working there for years. Poorly managed store with a high turnover rate throughout most of the 6 years that I worked there. Departments throughout the store were short-staffed. If a worker got 2 days off in a row and a consistent work schedule in one department, you earned it or you were lucky. People promoted to department supervisors WITHOUT having worked in the department first as a worker. Alot of times, they were promoted just because they fit the corporate image or they were friends with someone in management. Working for the Home Depot is like working for the hardware, home improvement version of Walmart."
good,"Inconsistent management practices, prolific employment turnover, inexperienced management (limited people skills), sales associates are often required to work in departments wherein they have limited or zero ksa's"
good,"For a temp, part-time job or first retail job this is a fantastic company. Opportunities to gain knowledge of construction and business are there if you want it. I liked solving customers' problems and was rewarded every day. It never became boring. Great people and great products."
good,"Not enough training for the job requirements, could never find help when needed, overall bad work experience, customers were wonderful, pay was good for area"
good,"The management stresses safety, but immediately contradicts themselves when asking you to perform tasks within the store. The company does not value employees that have multiple years experience within the company as they will hire someone new with no experience at the same pay rate or more and ask you to train them."
good,"La empresa esta buena ya que con los mismos clientes vas aprendiendo cosas que te pueden servir mas adelante en tu dia a dia"
good,The service desk was a little bit busy but in a good. Help locate customers packages. order customers online orders and also do phone sell and help customers in the store
good,Position eliminated without any actual reasoning with promise of placement into another position.  The ISM's that were kept weren't kept because of work ethic but because of tenure.
good,"pretty easy, just clean and organize product, build displays. we would check product inventory prices and locate product to be put on the shelves. maintain product signage, price tags, display photos."
good,Lazy management they walk around and talk and blame others for work they did not finish. I try to help others as much as possible however everyone excepts others to do their job for them
good,Good people to work with. And fun atmosphere always something to eat. Good schedules and nice people who works around you . No chance for advancement in some roles.
good,Work place generally fun.  We work hard when were busy and not so much when it slows down.  Once you learn your job and know what is expected of you your pretty much on your own.  If you have good sales and good customer reviews.  You have job security.
good,"You can go far if you are willing to make yourself available.  Work times are all over the clock, but may have changed since I worked there.  I enjoyed securing a 6am to 3pm job shortly arter being hired. I was shocked to see even Managers working all shifts.  "
good,"The Home Depot offers advancement, but to minorities first. As a manager I was even told to promote minorities over others. They also subscribe heavily to the ""good 'ol boy"" network if you want to succeed. It always seemed too easy for a change to happen based on a person's standing with upper management."
good,My time at Home Depot wasn’t the best.  I  was just working there temporarily until I found better employment. I really didn’t care for the low hours and low pay.
good,"another job injury completely ignored by the company, torn meniscus injured when dismounting a forklift to assist a customer. I wear glasses when operating a saw it is mandatory to wear safety goggles over my corrective glasses,  this fogged my corrective lens which made for a hazardous condition. I would remove the safety goggles  it seems like every time the store manager was there to tell me ""You could be fired"" which got real old in spite of my fogged condition"
good,"ambiente de trabajo armónico, horarios de trabajo con flexibilidad"
good,"Great people, busy all the time makes days go by fast."
good,"Home Depot has great benefits, but it is very physically demanding. Management can be extremely stressful. It is a great gateway company if you are planning to only work for a short period of time."
good,"Its a strange mix, on one hand there is no real standard dress code for employees (besides manager) but on the other hand Apron Code is strict as can be. The store i work at really struggles with in store culture because there is such a mix of working hours. This makes for embitterment between employees sometimes, and no real glue to hold the store together. Im not sure if this is indicative of other stores in my district, or an exception, but a high turnover rate makes it difficult to bond with people that you work with."
good,"The  job has good benefits for those who coming to work part time. Fast paced work environment, always have something to do. Management poor at communicating. Management/department supervisors  lacks empathy, lacks fairness, lacks cohesion and last but not least lacks honesty."
good,"Employees are good to work with, management is garbage. No career advancement, no promotions, awards given out unfairly upper management mistreats lower employees."
good,A lot of unfair management at the Thatcher store... a lot of double standards and management breaking safety rules that they write employees up for...
good,"I enjoyed learning and building customer skills working for this company for over 14 years. The company itself stands for greatness but management were not on the same page. I could of stayed with the company but the lack of support from management team was horrid, it was like being in high school. They were teamed up wit favorites and weren't interested in supporting the whole team."
good,Because it was just a part job at night it's hard to comment on the management there because I never really had to interact with management there. I just did my job and went home.
good,I was hired at Home Depot as a seasonal employee. I worked at night stocking shelves. It was kind of stressful stocking the shelves at night. It wasn't that bad of a job.
good,This is your typical Big Box experience. Everything that employees do is based around hitting goals that are often unobtainable. There was absolutely no flexibility in working hours and the schedule was very unpredictable. There were times that I would finish a shift at 11pm one night and then be scheduled to work again at 5am the next morning. Management was often aloof to the issues that staff were concerned with.
good,"Poor management is all I can say. Lack of career advancement and the pay raises are minimal. It is a good job for those looking for flexible hours, however."
good,I worked for the home depot for 3 years and continued to get paid minimum wage while all the new hires made more than me.  Even climbing up the home depot ladder they only raise your salary by 33 cents at a time. I think becoming a department manager you male 15 an hour.
good,"I was a contractor or 2 and a half years with no increase and no advancement, but such is contracting... It took me forever and a day to get my laptopThey let me go with no real notification. beyond 3 days. I did work from home sometimes so that was cool"
good,"Home Depot was a wonderful place to work for the first few years I was there then the founders left and things when downhill very fast.  It came to the point in my store in which schedules would be posted on a Wednesday or Thursday for the following week.  Company policy requires they be posted at least a week in advance but complaining is not good at Home Depot.  They would have you work a closing shirt u til 11pm and then back at 7am, plus they would change schedules at the last music ute.  Overtime is forbidden normally.  They are always understaffed so it's very difficult to cover your department because you will be all over her store trying to assist with thing of which you have no knowledge.  The benefits were great and Home Depot used to pay very very well for retail but they no longer pay well.  They often work the higher paid employees into the ground in an effort, I believe, to get them to quit so they can hire two people for the price of one.  The burn out rate is very high and the morale is very low in my experience and from talking with friends who are still employed by Home Depot."
good,Given a shift I preferred twice and had it taken without explanation.  I'm always asking for hours only to be given minimal hours.  Later I am asked to work more hours or come in on days off because others quit or are no shows. Little to no appreciation for my efforts.  Paychecks do not cover the bills. No set schedule.  Extremely difficult to get time off.  Almost no training. No care for retaining associates. I like the people I work with but the ridiculous hours do not allow for any planning of a schedule.
good,"There are so many departments and different positions that it felt uninviting. There were always people that you didn't know, even though you worked with them. Wished for a little smaller work team."
good,"Working at home depot isn't an issue. It's just the way they go about things, the hours administered, the general environment, the way they manage things, and their plans for the future that sucks."
good,"Very flexible working with students but don't expect to move up quickly making a career there. Annual raises are very low, and no incentives to move up and learn different departments."
good,poor management doesn't have any effort to find talent and pursue them. even if you show a will and want to climber a later your waiting your time. poor management
good,"Not a bad place to work, people are very friendly. I wanted to change departments for 2 months and they did nothing about it. Wouldn't offer me fill time. Made me come in just to unload truck. 4 hour shifts and no full time option."
good,"Management at the company depends on your manager. I worked 6 different positions at the Home Depot over a period of 3 years. Each position was dependent of the manager you work for. Some jobs were great, depending on the manager, others were miserable,  because you were not provided with the tools you need to help you do your job. Overall, the work environment completely relied on management support. If you don't have the tools you need to do your job, it got a little frustrating."
good,"Very low paying job with a lot of good potential wasn't for terrible managers. Dealing with customers is great and, helping people with their needs and projects is fantastic. However, the store is understaffed (so, managers can get a fatter bonus) which puts a lot of stress and pressure on associates working on the floor."
good,"When other departments are called to assist a customer they will not answer or ignore us and in turn cashiers get yelled at by customers. Associates do not respect each other. Cashiers are looked down on by even management as if they are above us. Part time pay started out for me at around $10.25 which was not enough for me to live on and would not give me a raise until later on, i now make $11 an hour. Scheduling was a disaster due to being short staffed some days and then others would have an over load of cashiers and not enough registers."
good,"I thought this was going to be a great company to work for until I realized that any kind of recognition you get from management would be used by said management to make themselves look good, not for recognizing employees who ""Live Their Values."""
good,"good luck making a career out of HD. In todays job market, they do NOT pay enough with raises according to job performance. This once great company has become a Target and not able to keep employees."
good,"A good place to work with a decent managed, but difficult if you have a poor one. It’s a thankless job where the only recognition is when the job is performed incorrectly."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working at The Home Depot. Although there are some cons of working here, such as: pay is not that great especially if you have bills to pay, security is not the best, and being a female I get harassed a lot by many customers and we cannot do anything about it."
good,"This used to be a great place to work.  In recent years however,  they have stopped caring about their employees or even customers.  They understaff the stores and then demand 3 or 4 different people's jobs from you.  You have to cover multiple departments all the time and are penalized for less than perfect customer service. Pay raises are a joke."
good,HD is a great place if you are young. A lot is expected of one person each shift. If you can kiss up you will do good. Don't have an opinion of your own. Management picks what policies they want to follow that suits them for that day.
good,This is a good company to work for but difficult to move up to a better position. If you're going to cashier I would get used to being on your feet a lot and having random breaks and lunches.
good,"No leadership training in regards to the upper Management staff. They were not willing to train properly but kept expectations high for results. In my nearly 2 years with them, I never received the proper training that was promised to me. It was put off time and time again. The only training I received was on my own with other Department heads. In my experience it is always more profitable for a company to invest in their employees to insure they are properly trained to meet and exceed the expectations of the company rather than always hiring new associates."
good,"There is no growth. There is a lot of employees so you would not get the hours you wish you want. It is east working here, so if you are looking for a slow, part - time, pace job, then this could be for you. You may have to carry heavy objects, depending on which department managements puts you in."
good,I had a very good experience working with the Home Depot. The employees are amazing to work with and everyone can be very nice! The only reason I am looking for different opportunities is because full-time positions are almost impossible to achieve in this work environment.
good,"If you were not in management, they only offered part-time.  Which provided no benefits.  I did have fun, but was looking for more hours and long term/permanent"
good,its good to work there if your in high school they don't treat there workers with the respect they deserve and the workers that go above and beyond they let them go or fired them and the ones that don't do work stay on site and contain there job
good,"Dealing with people all day long, you get 30 min lunch and 2 15 mins breaks. sometimes you have to work outside when its super hot or super cold. work place was okay don't have alot to say about this job it was a job while I was going to college"
good,"the store I worked at was pretty chaotic in the sense that you will get multiple managers telling you conflicting things. it's very frustrating, alot of times it is hard to tell who is really in charge. I did enjoy most the employees I work with, for the most part they are good people."
good,"This place is decent if you arent on the freight team. Only a few managers were good people. The rest of them are rude, an like to point fingers. They were supposed to make me and a few other people full time, which didnt happen.. even though we worked full time hours we were only part time. The pay sucks as well, I only made 12 an hour, even after i got my lisense for the reach truck/order picker. Everyone else made 12 an hour also, even if there job wasnt as hard as mine, which really doesnt seem fair."
good,"The job tasks are simple and easy to accomplish."
good,"There Homer awards are fun but feels like elementary school. You will be paid min. wage to do not just your job but also your managers job, customer services job, the delivery companies job etc. If you are looking for a work/life balance, you will def. not get that! They say a computer makes your schedule and it can not be changed, even if you are working 7 days a week. You will close at 10pm and open at 7am and continue to do this every other day until you snap. They do not want real sales people and will not give you what you deserve, they just want disposable people. When they get a real sales person they just over load you with work with no compensation or incentive and you will be paid min. wage to do so, when most places offer commission as an incentive to sell. There profit sharing is a joke as well. Just avoid them all together as it is not a long term job."
good,It was a fun place but a lot of discrimination when it came down to job positions. Had a lot of fun times there just wish my race or me not knowing how to speak Spanish fluently stopped my opportunity for advancement.
good,"Greet customers and perform as cashier. I learned how to measure, and identify different work tools. Management is okay, but they cut hours. there is a mixture of culture. Lifting heavy objects. I receive discounts and deals from the store."
good,there is ok work placement environment and pay is ok for a starter job. I would say this is a good place to work in the summer time there is lots of hours
good,This is a good place to work if are willing to work overnight anywhere from 9PM to 6AM. The management does allow for the workers to get overtime every once in a while.
good,The people there are good but management is blind to their employees and their skill. The management has their favorite employees and they are able to do as they please without repructions
good,"As in most retail based companies, HD focused more on the revenue it could bring in and knew it had a revolving door of applicants so there was little to know focus on the cares and concerns of the employees."
good,Home depot is a good work plave has room for advancement. Seasonal hohrs arent great when traffic slows down hours go down not so flgreat for someone raising a family but who has already raised one and looking for employment or children in school
good,"Home Depot has the tools to teach a person about each department.  It is a very good course to go through.  I loved my customers and learning about each department,  There was associates that could get away with not doing there job and still look perfect in the eyes of management."
good,Not a bad place to work. Just very slow pace. Part time hours get cut so bad. Management is nice but like I said not enough hours when you get 27-30 then get cut way down to 13-16 a week. No weekly pay is just awful for any family.
good,"Not loyal , need to implement a work life balance,listen  and show interest in the advancement of associates, training properly on all levels ,proper communications."
good,Certain departments had great management which makes your job run smoother than others were too busy showing favoritism and not valuing hard workers..
good,"Great company to work for in regards to benefits, etc...."
good,this is a great starting job for a college student or someone out of high school. Does not pay the bills but it helps with other costs of living. No advancement.
good,"Company recently (June 2018) rolled out a new labor model that drastically cuts staffing throughout the store. Prior to this, profits were at an all time high. This was done as a short term money grab to drive profits and shareholder value. This will eventually lead to a crash in sales, customer service and profits. Company has also ""restructured"" (aka eliminated jobs) at several levels that put previous promotion opportunities out the window."
good,"busy every day, too strict on floor rules, Cashier manager is rude, great HR coordinator, great head cashiers, great customers, great store manager, not easy to become a full-time worker."
good,"Having worked for The Home Depot for the last 3 years I have really enjoyed my time there. I think that The Home Depot could invest more money in their store employees. Working face to face with customers is possibly the hardest area of employment working for The Home Depot. We deal with a lot of customer issues, product issues, and inventory issues. As a Supervisor, I find that I am sometimes a one-stop shop. I manage, I sell, I pack down all my own shelves, I clean and I handle customer resolution for all four departments. On top of my daily duties, I am having to fill the role of what should be two other employees. I think the company expects too much from a single individual."
good,Okay place to work. Have to truly beg management if you want full time. Not good pay an hour. Sometimes fun and sometimes stressful. Not enough positive criticism.
good,Most of the guys I worked with were nice.  Management was not around much during my shift so I can't speak to daily interaction.  I worked evening shift (7pm to 11pm).  I learned how to operate a pallet jack and forklift.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of opportunity for full time hours.
good,"As an example; in a recent month I worked 16 shifts with 14 different start times.  Chaotic conditions.  You learn your role by quizzing other employees.  Management didn't work with each other and no clear lines of communication or authority.  ""Throw you over the fence and hope you make it""."
good,It kept me busy which made the day go by fairly quickly. Management didn't seem to care about individuals. Expect angry/irritated customers. The high turnover rate meant there were new people (which means training people to do the same job over and over).
good,Company is more about making money than taking care of the employees.  Cutting a lot of the part timers hours.  The Home Depot use to be all about their people and taking care of them.
good,"As a cashier your expected to stand on the concrete of the store instead of the provided mats that prevent stress and nerve damage. The management seems forgetful or preoccupied with other concerns and forgets to give associates breaks on time, and clearly plays favoritism."
good,I enjoyed designing and working with the clients who came into the store. Helping with all their needs  The atmosphere was fast pace but rewarding.  As the merchandising Trainer I would train the employers in all areas of the company to assist the customers.
good,"Work day is 10hrs/4 days, plenty of overtime.  Job is physical and can be mentally demanding for most people.  Building is climate controlled, reaches around 80 mid-summer.  Nice breakroom with plenty of table/chairs, microwaves and refrigerators.  Also, have a rec area on warehouse floor."
good,"Management has changed and the way the job I did has changed since I have worked there. It is a physical job a lot of heave lifting. Pro: lot of pot luck meals, management was good when i was there, break room had a lot for employees, training in different areas. Cons: long hours, physical job,"
good,I worked there for three years so it wasn't completely repulsive. In fact I loved it for the first two but then we got new management and I struggled. The job was more about outdoing each other then progressing personally.
good,"I worked for home depot call center when it was originally called US Remodelers. It was US Remodelers for several years, then in 2015 Home Depot bought them out. That is when the company took a tuern for the worse. The management is terrible and they show favoritism to certain employees."
good,"Poor management! It's like a big building where everyone talks bad about everyone, it's pretty sad! That was the hardest part for me working there. Thumbs down!"
good,"I have only worked at this company for 6 months, I don't feel that I have enough data to provide a fair overall review of this company at this time..."
good,"Home depot is very willing to write you up for offenses that are ridiculous, and they definitely have favourites. One worker was written up for 2 days missed and another missed 2 weeks and no one said anything. Another worker was written up for ""not moving fast enough"" in the work environment."
good,aquí desarrolle el tener paciencia a los clientes y darles un buen trato como personas.
good,"customers are funny,"
good,Hardest part of the job was closing the department in a certain amount of time that the current assistant manager on duty wanted so it can look perfect for the next day
good,"Was an ok place to work, they trained me and had me certified for forklift and reach truck as a part time employee and even though i was one of the only ones trained in these 2 vehicles they would not give me full-time, instead they would work me one week at 35 hours and the next at 20 as to not break the cap."
good,It’s a good job but they can pay more and consider the employees instead of rude customers who feel they are above you. I also wish this place had a union
good,The days can be long and boring. When it is busy it is fast paced. The management can be very intimidating at times. The hardest part of the job is helping customers when you don't have a knowledge of the store. They leave that to you to figure out where everything is.
good,"good job until I took a full time position.  the most enjoyable part was that its outside and your pretty much always busy but then they had me doing other lot guys ""highschoolers or plain lazy"" jobs and I wasn't getting paid for doing job too yet they expected it done and everytime I would tell higher ups or managers I would get accused of complaining too much.  When it came to break times most all of the other lot guys took way longer or just came back whenever they felt they wanted and/or blamed the reason on ""talking with management""."
good,"Not much good to say about working here. I injured myself on the job. after returning to work that's when i knew they were cut throat. I was treated like an liability then setup to be fired. i knew it was a setup because once i was terminated, the corporate office investigated my termination then overturned the decision and reinstated me as an employee again but i was relocated to a different store. then one i got there, my hours was cut back dramatically forcing me to quick. at that point i was done. i don't typically write reviews but this has to be made known."
good,"I worked part time at Home Depot. My hours fluctuated excessively from week to week. Some weeks I had 12 hours and others weeks I had 30 hours scheduled. The time periods I worked also fluctuated excessively. I could be scheduled to work until closing one day and then be scheduled to open the store the next. Also, working on a concrete floor all day really gets to your feet & back."
good,"For all to see, hopefully! i don't recommend home depot until they can treat employees with more respect & pay them what they deserve, it's not an easy job having to deal all the bull that goes on there... I can't... I... I've said too much already."
good,"I was hired for a part time position but expected to fill a full time role. I was over qualified for the job and the pay was terrible. At the time I worked here the store had no store manager and no HR manager. They cycled through people like crazy. It was not a great environment. Maybe if the circumstances were different it would have been a better job. However, everyone was stressed out and spread thin."
good,"I have been working at a store for over one year as a supervisor. The work load is far too much than what can be handled. We were understaffed throughout he whole year. Associates, preferably part timers, were leaving almost every two weeks because they felt the work did not match up with the pay. If you hold out long enough you can make decent money and job opportunity is there. But it all depends on your store manager and store you work at."
good,I enjoyed helping people. I did not enjoy lifting heavy washers/dryers/refrigerators for stocking.  Often short staffed so had to cover more than just my department.
good,"I love most of the associates at Home Depot, but I'm leaving because they won't work around my college classes and they didn't give me the job that they hired me for."
good,It's alright for a check but i wouldn't want to stay long. over the years you would eventually see the benefits of working there but its not worth the long wait
good,"not paid of for my position, manager was weak"
good,"New store manager was trying to make a point firing good employees. She wants weak people working for her that wont stand up and just do what they are told. Its really sad because Home Depot preaches good values. Especially about inclusion and diversity in the work place. The store Manager is trying to take that away so less people will complain about her fake, lying two faced ways. Stores that actually live the values the founders of The Home Depot intended are doing well.  Plainwell, not so much."
good,It is very stressful department supervisors do not have a set schedule like associates. There is a lot of drama. Management are unprofessional. Work life balance is difficult.
good,The jobs sucks  but your coworkers are good for the most part. The management team is in need for a lot of improvement. The pay should be a lot more for the work you are expected to do.
good,"I worked overnights, and the culture was difficult to adjust to because there was no type of management around (except for a dept. head, who doesn't hold the keys necessary to maintain discipline) thus the dept. was free to operate as it saw fit because no kind of management was around to enforce rules. This made working there very cut-throat, uneven, and clique like. "
good,As a freight associate we would stock the store and get it ready for the following business day as well as cleaning the store making it look presentable before we left.
good,"I thought, I had found the perfect part-time job, when I was offered a part-time position  cashiering at our local Home Depot.  Training is computer-based and if you're lucky, you may be able to follow and work with a more experienced cashier for a day or two.  Customer service, is the top priority at Home Depot and  needless to say, you will  be reprimanded for complaints.  Scheduling is pretty flexible,  however as a part-time employee your hours are very  inconsistent.  You, will be harassed and hounded  continually to obtain consumer and commercial credit card accounts!!  Short staffing, is a norm at my location and it is not uncommon to have  several departments , wth no one scheduled to work!! Most of the managers, are very nice and are more than willing to help out in an  emergency situation."
good,its fun to work there the culture is great the hours for a salary manager is a lot working 55 to 65 hours a week is a lot that was the hardest about the job
good,"While there are many benefits to working for the company, you are easily replaceable. Your success and any promotion will heavily depend on what member of  management has your back and will vouch for you. It does not matter how many degrees or knowledge you have. You need to suck up to someone who will vouch for you in order to be advanced."
good,"It could improve on staff , there’s not enough help to help the amount of customers that come through the doors. Other than that they have great benefits such as 401k, paid vacation if you are a people person it’s a great/awesome place to work."
good,Flexible with department assignments. Decent Pay. Hours are okay. Recognition and pay raises are scarce. The company provides good training both hands on and self paced studies.
good,Every department was short staffed. There was no morale amongst the associates. Management was not helpful and overworked. Associates were not appreciated.
good,"The work was unsteady, whoever reviewed the job first did not get a first evaluation good. The management gave you no support they had their favorites."
good,its ok to work for them all stores are different. and are not ran the same way so each store is like its own business. the people you work with expect managers are wonderful
good,Worked as a temp spring of 2014 . Really enjoyed the experience . As outside garden there were many opportunities for learning about products through compamy database . These courses allowed me to help customer make informed decisions about lawncare . lawnmowers and grilling
good,You either like it or you don't.  It's not for everyone.  Management quality depends on what store you are at.  I miss the people I worked with and most of the customers.  It was an 11 year roller coaster ride.
good,"Fulfillment was a pretty laid back job, I was in Shipping and receiving and drove a forklift on some days, I worked few hours a week and the pay was very low. Its ok for a part time job."
good,"The ""Associates"" work their tails off each day and are very under appreciated by the shoppers and the management.  In the break room there is a board with the latest Home Depot Stock price.  On it says, ""This is where we are today, tomorrow is up to you"".  Problem with this stems from the fact that not one associate could by a share of stock since they are paid the least and most is hourly.  It is a real kick in the teeth seeing this everyday.  Good people deserve to be paid much better."
good,"Overall, The Home Depot has a place for advancements if you are willing to put in the work.  The job is easy. I would say the hardest part of the job being able to sit in one place for a long period of time."
good,"They gave me a lot of trouble about sick days (despite having valid documentation from a doctor - which is perfectly within my rights). None the less I understand they run a business and need someone to be at work but sometimes you need to stand by your employee for the long term, not burn them when they are down."
good,"Typical Day:  Lots of physical labor, loading block, soils, carrying heavy products on ladder."
good,"Something that i really do not like about the home depot was management. managers might play favorites and do not treat all their associates equally. also the environment on the job is not professional at all. people will try to get on you for the smallest thing you do wrong. personally in my opinion i just go do my job and not pay attention to anybody else actions because if it does not affect me i see no reason for me to over react about someone else not doing their job. i will try to help them, but not try to burn them down."
good,Home Depot is not bad if you really need employment.  They do not pay well for those with a degree.  You can learn a lot of things that are valuable in real life experiences if you own a home or enjoy doing those types of things.
good,Company truck was nice but drove all over the state so kinda had to have one. Long long long long hours. Avg 10-12 hour days and every Sat. Sunday was the only day off. Very stressed to hit numbers and schedules. Vendors pick and chose what jobs they want. Only a few good trustworthy vendors. Doesn't give vendors enough days to finish jobs correctly. Always rushed. Sales always thought they were right on their measurements and fight you to the bone until proven they were wrong and still complain because it took from their commission. Some very good people to work with. Customers always comes first even on Easter Sunday when you have to go see an angry customer.
good,"Overall, I like the concept. But kind of hard to see, the miss management. It could be better. Overall a safe and fun place to work. For part time employee it’s kind of hard. They give unworthy employees full time."
good,It is exactly what you expect. I packed out freight overnight at a retail chain. I was very bored during the work day. My coworkers were friendly. My manager was lazy and demotivating
good,"Worked in recycling"
good,Not a bad place for part time work.i was in aplliances..i learned alot about appliances.thee hardest part of the job was the slow days and the best part was making the quotas and doing a job well done for my superiors
good,The experience was good. But I wanted more for advancement. Jobs open and close any anytime. The more you know the more hours  you get. Weekly pay is better then bi-weekly
good,You have to pull orders all over the store sometimes by yourself with the other departments reluctant to help you. Management is always on your back making sure you finish your orders on time while they sit in their offices doing nothing.
good,"I simply wound up in a position held accountable for achieving sales goals. The problem lies in that I am not a salesperson. However, the other facets of my job require technical, creative, and problem-solving faculties that are an excellent fit. For the most part, we have historically had a management ""team"" with a ""policy of avoidance,"" meaning that they would avoid you like the plague if you needed them for anything. This is a big part of my discontent, as is the lack of ""balance"" in the proverbial ""unicorn"" that is coined as being ""work/life balance."""
good,I was a team member trainer/ Haz-Mat trainer.  I loaded and unloaded trailer of product that was going to be shipped to different store throughout the region.  I trainer all new employees on the different equipment within the building.  The most enjoyable part of job was the team building group that the company did together.
good,i was a hard worker team player stayed Motivated work well others i really liked working there the workers was pretty good working with its products being sold at home depot had real sales during the holidays
good,"Call customers to schedule the installation of their door purchased from Home Depot. Submit a daily schedule of installations to be conducted that day/week.  Provide quality installation and instructions to the customer on the maintenance, up keep and how the door works and functions.  Submit signed waivers at the end of the day of work completed."
good,Organized and arranged merchandise in aisle and handled warehouse inventory. Handled customers realtions in a gracious manner and in accordance to company policies with protocols put in place for you  evironmental concerns.
good,"Promesas para los empleados en cambios de posiciones."
good,"I don't know if it was the location I worked at, or if all of the locations are the same, but my time here was over my stressful and not worth it. The store management was too focused on playing favorites and being popular that hard workers got over looked and people who slacked off were fine because they were friends with the supervisors. There was a lot of shady business going on and the amount of work we took on as cashiers was not reflected in the pay. Cashiers deal with so much and to be the lowest paid is unfair, when majority of the time the people on the floor are hiding in the staff room or ignoring the customers. For minimum wage, this job is not worth it. It stresses you out, the hours are unstable - you can go from a 27 hour week to 10 hours, and they don't respect you, your health or your outside life. Corporate doesn't seem to care and because they're such a big company it's hard to express your feelings because you're easily replaceable. Moving up is nearly impossible unless, once again, you're part of the in crowd."
good,"As a tenured manager who has worked in another Home Depot, I found the culture in the Montana store to be very different. I did not have the same opportunity to advance in my career as in other states. Out of the 12 department manager positions available only 1 was non-Caucasian. My previous experience as an high performing (hi-po) manager in another store was never taking into account when it came time for advancement."
good,"Home depot was a fun place to work because of the people that worked there. Management was not the best and, depending on which department you worked it, it could be a back breaking job or something monotonous and boring."
good,"Advancement is very limited in this job setting. An employee may be asked to transfer from one department to another, but it is more of a lateral movement instead of a promotional movement. No matter how long you have been with the company, they do not take that loyalty as consideration to moving up within the company."
good,"The job was demading and the hours were terrible."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work as long as you have a strong management team.  The people I work with is the best part of my job. The only issue I have ever had is the culture of the building.
good,"Home Depot started off as a great company, but they will make you work 12-14hrs a day in any management setting. They will make you close the store at 11pm and open the store a 4am."
good,"For the most part the store managers wouldn't talk to anyone as though they were too important to be bothered with it. It seemed as though the only reason they would talk to a head cashier was because they had to, not because they wanted to."
good,I worked customer service and it was what you would expect. Managers were not quick to help customers which left a big strain on the customer service associates.
good,Typical day at work would consist of me being on a register for the majority of the day. We usually swap positions (registers) later in the day to relieve people for their lunches and breaks.
good,managment at the 1802 home depot is terrible. they bring their personal issues into the workplace. they treat lower associates like they own them and what says goes. they aren't  interested in ideas that benefit the company but only want you to do what they say no questions asked (even when i could prove mathematically my ways were better and saved the entire store money)
good,"I hope things have changed but Training was very juvenile and included low quality cartoon videos. Communication within work groups was poor. Focus on culture was very high, but low wages and inconsistent work schedules weaken the sediments and efforts to keep morale high."
good,Exemplified the attitude that school wasn't helpful to my career advancement and gave me over 35 hours a week when i was only part time supposed to be working 20 hours and it got in the way of my school work and grades since they weren't accommodating during finals week.I decided to leave and focus on school.
good,"Great Hours"
good,"I don't approve of the Home Depot because I, and so many others, are scheduled for unrealistically low hours every week. 12-14 hours per week is not uncommon. People can't live off of that kind of pay."
good,"It was an good work environment. "
good,the job is fairly simple i would enjoy 6 hours a day and a higher pay than what i am currently getting. i am told by other people i work with i was supposed to get a pay bump when moving to freight but i haven't heard anything like that from management.
good,"I was a Customer Service Rep. and they had me do everything that was not my job to do, but I did it because I am a team player. But they did not want to pay me for my work nor give me a raise."
good,start at 5am got out between 9am - 11am. had very brief interactions with customers. most co workers were very friendly and reliable. i enjoyed the fixed schedule and being able to leave early in the day.
good,"I was a temporary, seasonal employee with a variable end date."
good,Funny how big HD is the companies stories from west to the Texas region seem to operate so different. Managers out west where good at teach helping managers here department call for help instead of helping go I need any available associate to that department for help
good,"While most of the people I work with are great, the few that arent make my job almost unbearable. The manager is an angry and inconsistent man and it is difficult to handle him."
good,we were given goals that were unattainable.  we were set up to fail by asking to do jobs that we not in MET's scope of work. we were under staffed for the tasks that were asked of the team.
good,Home Depot was a good place to work they made sure you were trained well. The only thing I wish I could do over is not take full-time or head cashier.
good,They never know what's going on or how to fix anything .. they choose favorites and everyone else they treat poorly and make them do 100 things while the people they like can walk around and do nothing. The only thing good about the store I worked at was the people I worked with .. they were hard working in garden and did what they had to do. It was only 2 people besides that .. other new employees would hide and talk multiple long breaks. Not the best place to work but it's a job. Also when a DM come through to the store to check up ..that is the only time you will see the managers in the store for more then 10 minutes.
good,"Co-workers were great; however, the pay and career advancement opportunities were very limited. Obvious favoritism amongst Management and upper management. Good place to work if you are in need of a job, but not a place to have start a career."
good,"liked it in the beginning, transferred to another state, different way of management no rules to follow all is hearsay from employees."
good,"Very well organized store, Management was great and very understanding when needed days off,  paid training and a simple training guide they used to teach us."
good,"I've been at Home Depot for 9 years an i have a great rapport with customers.I work in multiple departments which makes me a valuable associate,but recently i've noticed that they hire people in management that have no clue how to run a department.They can't be found in their department because they are in the upper management office or socializing with other managers.Then when it's time for a review, they give you a bad review so they don't give you a raise....they only look out for themselves to move up in the company no matter who's throat they have to step on."
good,"Stocking the shelves with merchandise making sure the store is clean for the next day. fast paced retail environment, dealing with different contractors and customers."
good,"Lots of hours, pay is good  but be ready to spend very long days working from 6am to 10pm a couple days a week. be prepared to work all summer, 7 days a week"
good,"If you have spare time it is interesting to work in this place. You learn while you helped people solved their problems, looking for something they can not find and rendering the best customer service you can provide."
good,Overall a poor place to work but I understand it is not bad for retail. High expectation for a supervisor with very low pay. In my case not worth it. They try to make the culture cult like to compensate for low pay.
good,"average day moving freight, management is average. co workers are nice. there really isn't anything hard to this job. they provide training operating equipment. the most enjoyable part of this job was the ability to work third shift"
good,"Its a good company to work for in general terms. However, the specific store location and general culture of the store can ether can be perfect opportunity for positive growth or a manifestation of transgression. In my time working for the company has giving me collective bag of  mix emotions. Each day you are relying on the support of fellow associates which is fine if there are the proper amount of associate cover the demands of store. On average there is rarely the proper of support in my experience. Therefore individuals who are motivated and hard working are usually carrying the majority of the work to make of for lack of the work force. So the company is really good but it really depends on which store you work for are a satisfactory experience."
good,"With my full year working at The Home Depot, I experienced a lot of favoritism, many unpreventable complaints, and the management didn't care about employees. I would only recommend this job if you have no experience and I would suggest you get out as soon as a year is over. The pay raise is minimal and not enough to keep a worker motivated."
good,"A typical day at work may be heavy customer contact at the register,"
good,"I moved up pretty fast. I was promoted to a head cashier before I hit my one year mark. After a few years I could do my job blindfolded. you must be able to work in a very fast paced environment, be able to work weekends, No Matter how far up you move in the company. They will work around school schedules. But you will get less hours. Usual work over what u are scheduled. And they don’t train properly. They just don’t have the hours. Or the people. Or time of day to trainbn"
good,"Was in between jobs working at the Depot. Workplace is full of kids who smoke pot and come to work high, and adults that seem to have failed in life. Management is cool though, but overall it's disappointing to know that basically no one working in this store has relevant experience to the department they represent. Despite the negativity, I would like to reiterate that the management structure is excellent and I love that they promote in-store and focus on growth of their employees. "
good,"Shift hours varied weekly and daily, working anywhere from 4-8 hours per day, heavy/bulky lifting of products is required, stocking shelves while standing on a secure platform ladder is required, sweeping aisles and storage bins, standing for long periods of time is also necessary. Occasionally there were slow periods where there was not much to do, you can only stock and face shelves for so long, as well as sweeping floors.  I enjoyed talking with customers and especially enjoyed helping them choose the right flowers and shrubs to plant that best suited their needs.  I liked being able to problem solve landscape and plant problems.  I did not like standing for long hours and the job does require a lot of walking and bending.  The hardest part of the position I held in the garden center was in April and early May when we had to water outside and inside plants before the doors opened to the public - sometimes it was very cold and you ended up inevitably getting wet while watering plant life.  Dragging and pushing large carts of flowers is not easily done.  I will say my experience there was good as far as other coworkers helping and the fun we had together while getting our job duties completed."
good,I felt like they could have done a lot more to keep their employees up-to-date on their skills. More team meetings for sure they were not really communicating to each other everybody was always too busy
good,"management limits chance of growth within the business structure of the company, corporate involvement is segregated and have sluggish response time and average worker can tell."
good,I spent over 20 years with Home Depot. The company made a scheduling change in 2016.  I was stuck with the forever shift of 12 to 9 pm.  Allowed for NO work/life balance.
good,I found that working at a call center for The Home Depot is the most ghetto environment that ever existed. If you just got out of prison and needed a job; then I would definitely recommend THD.
good,When we had great mangers it was a fun place to work. Some of my mangers were disrespectful to the employees that worked in the store and some mangers played favorites.
good,Through my experience through working deliveries I have come to notice that there is little communication. Ontop of the lack of communication there is more put onto specific people then there should be.
good,It`s ok for a first or temporary job. The higher up you move the less secure your job and more cut throat it becomes. This varies from location to location.
good,This hardest part of the job is the communication between management personnel.  At times there are three different directions for three different Assistant managers.
good,I worked for Home Depot for 2 years in pro desk averaging 1.5 million a year in sales. Main job was figuring out jobs and making final sale for the contractors
good,Always changing management  .. frieght team  always getting blame always moving always changing the rules and safety rules always making it harder to do your job.
good,"Management stuck in time zone of antiquated thinking on efficient daily operations.  Many people thrown onto floor without enough shadow including licensing on machinery.  Many walk through inspections for ""Show"", yet not reviewing proper operation from a customer perspective.  Also, lack upper management interaction with "
good,"stressful environment management shows no empathy only cares about quanity of work not quality, scheduling doesn't allow time with family not living up to core values"
good,"I did not need benefits from this employer, so I did not enroll in their program.  However, Home Depot at the time in which I worked there did not offer an employee discount to their employees or any perks for working there.  There was a great sense of team work and team environment appreciation mainly cultivated by my direct supervisor."
good,"Temporary position, then I started to like it there, wanted to join the Met group to get in full time, started training me in the vault, learning various office duties, was cashier also, loved the morning shift, did not like working every weekend, great coworkers and customers, all in all pretty good job, left do to moving due to family."
good,"This job is honestly one that I had a love for. It taught you so many life skills and trades. You meet great associates and even greater customers. I came in as a cashier and was advanced to the sales floor in less than 90 days (Probation period) I worked on the sales floor until summer 2015 when i was given the opportunity to advance to head cashier. The position was good it taught you how to be a leader of a large group but also required early rising and late exits. Many times i was held hours past my shift because there wasn't relief or the managers were too busy being lazy in the office. Many associates and mangers lacked discipline, drive, and ambition. Alot of times the weight fell on me to get the job done. I would say I enjoyed the compensation but the overall stress was not worth it and this is NOT a job to get if you need security. HARDEST PLACE TO RECEIVE FULL TIME REGARDLESS OF YOUR WORK ETHIC."
good,"I have nothing to say about working for Home Depot. If you want to know, Go fill out an application. I don't want to say anything about Home Depot at this time"
good,"The worst thing about it there are too many changes in management. You get used to working for a manager that cares about the low level employees, then you get a jerk who only cares about himself and the other managers and it makes for a lot of disgruntled people."
good,"If you like a fast-paced environment, this is for you.  It requires extreme levels of prioritization to accomplish any goals, though.  There are constant fires to put out which take time away from other priorities.  At the end of the day, it is very satisfying to know you are ultimately helping the customer in the store."
good,Changed hours half way thru season from what was expected. Some of the bosses definatel y need to be reviewed as they sure didn't provide the required information
good,The manager at the time was the only good thing there. A lot of people you had to work with was lazy and take advantage of hard workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
good,"I was in the  paint department , I was responsible for mixing and answer all customer questions. Also I had to carry 1 and 5 gallon cans for  mixing. I was expected  to work all shifts and days≥"
good,"was a fun place to work, but not enough hours no benefits. to hard to transfer back to my own area, they were always hiring new management so nobody new what was going on."
good,"you can work as hard as you can all day but by tomorrow all of your work is undone, not only that but you h=get no thanks for any time volunteered for other tasks as the management sees it as your obligation to stay. As a temporary job it is not bad but it is not something to stick with for a long time."
good,Decent job that paid well but a lot of  manual labor and not enough breaks. You'll receive company benefits  after 90 days of employment. Cannot change departments before 6 months.
good,Management is very unpartial and favoritism is shown a lot. If you work hard depending on the manger it is appreciated. But there is a lot of back stabbing and gossiping  that goes on.
good,"Wouldn't want this as a long term job, too many politics within home depot. I was a cashier for a while and I was also part time, they cut my hours so bad that I would work 1-2 days a week so I was getting 10-16hr weeks."
good,"Working at home depot . Management liked to joke and bully employees which came a lot of fellow co workers to quit. Management was never on floor to help, complained when found and ate on the floor. They set horrible examples for all employes."
good,"A typical day is 5 to 6 hours per day.  weekends are required. You must have good communicati9on skills when dealing with the public."
good,"Depending on what store you are at"
good,"I enjoyed working with most customers and coworkers."
good,Working at Home Depot was an interesting job to start with. I did get to learn how to run a forklift a scissor lift and a couple other piece of equipment. Not a bad job
good,The Company may seem a certain way just to get you to apply but in real life on the job is totally different. Don't get to comfortable with any one you will get stabbed in the back in the long run.
good,"Home depot is a good job to start with if you're not trying to move up and you only want to get paid for a physical job."
good,not bad at first and customers were nice for the most part but managment was lacking as well as didnt always treat workers very nice or didnt always help
good,"Not enough open dialogue and honesty. You are told what to believe."
good,"The day was tougher on weekends and mid day during the week.  It was fast paced if you constantly moving.  If it was slow the day seemed to drag on and on. "
good,Culture was poor when I worked here. They were going through a huge layoff of mid management and seem to not care about the employees. The C-level staff were more concerned with their pay.
good,"So far, it was ok when i started working over there. current employees were unwilling to train or help you around. There is no flexibility. Schedules are awful."
good,I loved the people I worked with but the new management that came in was horrible. I had been promoted 2 times in 6 months and then a new store manager came in and fired most supervisors so he can hire his friends as supervisors. He was later then fired. It was slow paced and boring but I did love driving around on the forklift moving product. Way to much unnecessary paperwork as well.
good,The Greeley Home Depot is poor management. The company does not care about their employees as much as they say they do. The supervisors and assistant managers and store manager lie to their employees. For months I have had to unload a truck by myself for months because they are too lazy to hire new people. The pay is low for the type of work. Other companies pay their associates $13-$16+ for the same exact job.
good,Love it here just to much drama and seems impossible to get fulltime when you work hard for it. Also hours are all over the place hard to take care of kids with all over hours. Also don't get acknowledged enough for good work.
good,I had a good experience I made a few friends and most of the customer's were nice management was terrible they wasn't organized need better team of leadership
good,need better management.most supervisors are never in their department or helping other associates lo of times you don't get a day off when you request it.same for vacation days.
good,Management could be a lot better .Only if main office- the suits knew most of their management is full of BS. I think the culture is great. But management just looks at you as a number and lots of feel good talk but little action. If your not in the circle you never get a chance to strive as Home depot I always thought was a super amazing job but I cant say that any longer.
good,During my 4 years with Home Depot I was responsible for ensuring our customers with an exceptional experience.I accomplish this through efficient and accurate training and transactions as well as assisting customers with locating any items necessary for their project needs or future needs to sell and much as I could.
good,"First thing this place could do is pay more considering the work you do "
good,"im a very oranize person every day i come into work i check and see what i have to do and i get rite to work "
good,It really depends on where your location is. Slower paced areas generally are more family oreniented where as faster paced locations are more stressful and stretch you thin while being  more cutthroat
good,"Working part time as a Garden Associate was a fun job with different challenges everyday. A lot of heavy lifting was required manually or with heavy equipment. Also required a great deal of knowledge about gardening (lawn care and equipment repair) with a new customer having a different problem almost everyday. It was a good feeling helping customers solve their problems, and teaching them correct methods for garden care."
good,"Home Depot the 1st 3 years was a great company to work for .Most of my colleagues were there to do their job and have a good time doing it. Everyone from Managers to the sales associates were willing to help out and help out the new employees. as Management changed over and over the only thing that mattered were the bonuses that Management would receive. my typical day at work was i stayed very busy helping and escorting customers all over the store ,(we had a large turn over in employees) Most of the newer employees had not had time enough to familiarize themselves with the many different departments. Day in and day out my repeat customers would come seek me out, either for my product knowledge or my product location skills.That was the most enjoyable and rewarding part of my job putting a smile on the faces of my Customers and knowing that they would be back. While working at the Depot i had every opportunity to brush up on product knowledge from computer use, talking with vendors and also with a lot of Customers that were in the construction trades. Sorry but I learned a lot about patience, and empathy. how to instinctively spot a person not having a good day, How to approach them in a friendly matter"
good,"HR acted like everyone was bothering her. Never even met the managers. The training there is a joke. 20 or so hours of videos on how to keep the company safe (injury lawsuits) and how lucky you are to work for them. Don't ask the HR stuff like "" who is my supervisor? Or ""who am I working with to train?"""
good,"Due to human resources consolidation within the company, JOBS were compromised because the management was upholding the new corporate hiring process and people lost their employment because of it."
good,"Working in a specialty position I was tasked regularly with going to customer homes and delivering/installing customer purchases despite company policy saying not to.  When these tasks put you over your hours for a week, management would do as much as possible to cut your hours down to not getting overtime based on position (full time or part time). Lots of heavy lifting work done independently without assistance. Sales goals are regularly unrealistic depending on the store and if the District Manager likes your store and is looking to get it shut down."
good,"ok job, bad management , no advancement.mainly seasonal .to many people doing the bare minimum and not caring about the other employees.not a team environment."
good,"this company promises the world to employees but does not follow through. they will praise you to your face then you hear them cutting you down behind your back . The biggest asset is the person working beside you ,"
good,i would break down pallets full with product that need to be separated for the scanner to process it in the system.. the people there were awesome.. it never felt like i was never a new person to the work place in the beginning.. the workplace overall was great in the beginning.. thats all.
good,"After many years of working here, weekends are unheard of and you will be short staffed and overworked. If management decides you are not playing by their everchanging rules they find a way to get rid of you. Store manager only comes to work three days a week (if that) and assistant managers are self serving and lack two way communication."
good,"If you need a job, this is a job."
good,"on a typical day we show up to the ware house load up on carpet then drive to the required location. I leaned how to install carpet. the hardest part of my job was lifting carpet, pieces way in around 140-250 pounds on some days but, I was there to get the job done. most enjoyable part of my job was making the customer happy and making sure they was completely satisfied."
good,"hard work fast paced very busy and at times stressful day of work"
good,"Overall, Home Depot is a good part time job. The advancement rate is minimal and the pay is low but one can learn a lot about different home improvement projects and how to complete them."
good,Worked in lumber dept. and hardware dept. helping people with their lumber cuts as well as their hand tools and power tools. Working with management and retail customers was informative and enlightening. Hardest part of job was part time hours.
good,I have been with home depot for about three years and i wish to find  new job with better management and opportunities for advancement within the company.
good,"After working at the Home Depot for 9 months, putting 110 % in everything I do, I've never been recognized for my work, I always help not only the costumers but also all my associates, specially serving as interpreter and in any heavy lifting, but I've seen new employees being promoted just for being always ""nice"" to our supervisors, the general manager is a very polite and classy lady, but the rest of the supervisors are a very different story."
good,"I liked working there in the beginning until management changed then it went down hill,  bad things happened there,  that management was involved in and not held accountable for."
good,Of you work hard and mind your business  your will be successful  for the most part.  If you have a bad management team it doesn't matter this great of an associate you are they will have  favorites and will not consider you at all.  Only a hand full of managers will support you. The others seem to not really care for anyone else but themselves.
good,"Due to the lack of training, the management team was unable to perform their duties to a high standard.  This lack of training was then taken out on the sales staff with goals that were unreachable.  Sales staff was held to a high standard but was never compensated for outstanding performance."
good,The workers are no longer the main aspect of this company. The money has got to their heads. Workers are being paid way too low and are expected to perform as if they were making much much more.
good,"Fun atmosphere and some room to grow but management has no clue how to treat the associates that put in hard work and reward them for it. Lack of culture makes you feel like just another number and not a human, meaning your expendable. There is also zero work/life balance."
good,"Many years ago, HD really cared about their employees, but it doesn't seem to be the case anymore. I have spoken to other past and current employees, and I cannot even write their sentiment. Things have not changed for the better."
good,"Just not where I needed to be. The concrete floor was really bad for me. The management wouldn't allow me to transfer to a different department and refused to train me to drive any of the lift equipment, even though I am a skilled driver. At first the excuse was that I was only a cashier, then I moved to flooring and they still refused to teach me saying that I could get one of the guys to do it for me."
good,Good place to work. Pay is above average or a retail establishment. Can move around store a lot so you are not in one department for long. Advancement to anything above supervisor can be difficult.
good,The management accused 7-9 people of stealing and fired them all even though they had no proof they ever stole anything. They did not have any footage or anything. They literally fired all of the Mexicans. It was so disappointing and sad.
good,"as big as The Home depot is, they employees that do the most. "" Hardware L1"" are overworked with really no awarding compensations. You learn alot from the job but it gets really really tough and leaves you constantly exhausted"
good,it is really fun to work with home depot. also it is good for students and new comers. pay rate is low but also giving benefit for health and profit sharing as well.
good,"While working at Home Depot, I was able to learn and be trained on how to use 2 different types of forklift equipment and obtained certification for each. Every payday, lunch is brought in and made available for purchase by the Employee Committee."
good,"There is a lot of turn around within this industry, lots of new faces that come and go."
good,I was in the paint department. I made paint for customers and helped them get any items needed. I also helped in other departments as needed when I had the time
good,The management needs a lot of improvement. The Florida City Home Depot is very unprofessional. The communication level is below a 3. The company cares more about themselves then who is working for them.
good,The hardest part of the is not having a person to train me for the job. I had to take computer test and they consider that training and that is wrong.
good,"Heavy lifting, customer service, home remodeling questions, fun environment , helping diy customers as well as general contractors, being prepared to learn something new every day"
good,Call Center lacking honest communications. Training staff is fun but not enough essential information during training.  The leadership could stand to take a leadership class. No one is on the same page.
good,The Sales Associate job in appliances is fairly easy once you have learned how all of the software systems function. You have to be on your feet all day and you have to lift some very heavy boxes at at times. Both of these are the hardest part of the job. Standing on concrete floors for 8 hours is very difficult as well.Providing excellent customer service is key to success with this job and has worked well for me.
good,"A typical work day is pulling products forward and trying to assist customers.  I have learned a lot of paint and what goes into choosing the right paint product for the job.  Management is not always there to help and will boost you  up but bring you down just as hard.  The work place culture is nice and coworkers are friendly.  The hardest part of the job is trying to please all the customers, but the most enjoyable part is when you get the customer that smiles and loves the hel you have given them."
good,I didn't work there long enough to give much of a review. Some people were very helpful but most were not. They were busy doing their own work. They never gave me the hours I was led to believe I'd get therefore I quit due to me not really clearing much money after gas and food. It just wasn't worth it for me.
good,"Home Depot does not give you a shift differential pay for working overnight.  They do not increase your pay if you are certified to use the electric machines.  You get the same pay regardless, but you have more responsibility.  The benefits are good - IF you can obtain full-time status.  There are many lazy people that work in the smaller stores (in my experience) and they never seem to get disciplined for their lack of work ethic.  Call-outs happen quite often.  Also, if you work for the freight team, you will be scrutinized for your work (or lack of it) more so than practically most of the people in the store.  That's just the way it is.  If you can befriend the managers, and be a ""yes-man"", you will surely advance in the company.  The people are very nice to work with."
good,This was like working in high school. So much gossip and animosity at all 3 Home Depots I worked at. There were managers that played favorites so job security and advance wasn't really in the cards if your were a good worker but did do any brown nosing.
good,"fast paced, work outside. management often tries to get too much work out of too few employees. the shift a schedule is good but opportunities for advancement do not exist."
good,"No implementation of prescribed systems by managers. Very disorganized and I'll-efficient."
good,"I would say, get ready to become a peon and work for a company that has adopted the Wal-Mart values of how to treat employees. I have not met too many people who have been hired after 2006 that are happy with their jobs at Home Depot. It is too bad. I think there is a great potential to be a great work place. Pay is low for loading up to 50 bags of 80 pound concrete bags. Loading lumber and heavy materials are seen as a peon job because there is now skill involved. It is heavy labor and there is a high turn over rate for some laborious departments. Stay away unless desperate for a job."
good,I worked for this company for almost a year and only had a department manager 2 months. The store manager at the time would show lots of favoritism.
good,My opinion is That Home Depot was a great company to work for but management and some of the staff made it very disappointing.
good,"Home Depot has inconsistant work schedule's. They make you do the job of 3 people, Almost constantly; Tires you out really quickly. Lowest paying retail warehousing Company on the market. Only good thing I can say about Home Depot is they have unbelievable benefits. Some I haven't even heard of that were really neat."
good,It was a place where I have worked while attending secondary schooling - unfortunatly there is a high turn over rate which was hard for long term employee's to have the respect and time off they deserved
good,"It was a good place to work. Management was always helpful and willing to help whenever possible. Whether it was customers or their associates. Although, the location I was employed at had a bit of a gossiping problem. Very high-school and unprofessional among some of the employees. Other than that, I enjoyed working there for the most part. I like that they strive to always put the customer first and make sure the customers needs are continuously met."
good,Given the vendor needs of constant product placement and new items job security is evident. Constant change in product allows for wide range of skilling from electrical to hands on product assembly.
good,The employees are easy to get along with and the overnight managers are pretty nice guys. They are understanding and will help you out if you need it.
good,hardest part off that job was the time that they gave u to clean up any of the new and used cars that they sold  the workplace culture was great everyone is really nice
good,"I worked the electrical department I had 14 aisles that needed to be organized and fully stocked with merchandise, put away freight, help customers with products thru out the whole store, and did a check list making sure that the department was clean and clear for customers to get around. I learned how to communicate with customers, to be a team player and a leader. Home Depot was lacking management leadership, members of my department and others were not doing their jobs as expected. The hardest part was dealing with the fact that the crew from my department was not doing their job."
good,"In Arkansas the company was great in Arizona the management was not pleasant "
good,Always teaching and giving product knowledge.  Management is well trained and willing to teach other associates.  They can improve with the amount of hours given to associates.
good,Home Depot was a place that at time the stress of finding things in the store made the job a little hectic but as far as the working environment if u did your job then the was no hassle from any management
good,I loved my job and was great at it the management was clicky and only recognized certain people they discriminated against illness and lower class persons. after I was let go due to temporary FMLA I reached out to the EEOC and the managers were fired. unfortunately they wouldn't restore my employment
good,"The management is the worst, they really don't have an open door policy. Managerment is very discriminating toward anybody who is not part of the drinking crowd after work which is against SOP"
good,This company seemed great in the beginning. I worked my was from a cashier to management with in two years . Then the company changed in sted of training associates on how to to the job. They would fire you until they find some one that can.
good,"I enjoyed  company's overall prospective.They offered great benefits, however the particular location I worked at had terrible management. They were bias and overall very unprofessional."
good,Overnight recovery team was very lackadaisical. No energy. horrible supervisor. bad communication skills BUT the job was always done before deadlines. Most enjoyable part of the job was to unload the mulch shipments
good,"It is a very nice place to work, however, the part time hours are inconsistent. That being said, the pay is pretty good. The inconsistency makes the hourly wages almost meaningless, and makes it almost impossible to live on."
good,"The co-workers are very cool and laid back and will make you feel like family. A typical day a work would be punching in for work, getting your uniform on and looking presentable, walking the long hallway to go to the customer service desk, saying hi and greeting people, going on break for about 20 minutes or 1 hour depending how long your shift is, going to punch back in and continue working until 12:00pm, then its time to go home. The management could be way better then what it is now. The hardest part of the job is that the managers and supervisors are non understanding to your personal life unless you've been an employee at their store for years."
good,"During the hiring process, some important information was left out."
good,"My job was the management of the return to work program, staff and clients. Overall the program had a high success rate of returning injured clients to work. I learned a great deal about a divers group of people and how to successfully work with them. The job lacked the management and positive support of the clinic and its director, thus the teamwork and respect necessary for rewarding work experience was not there."
good,"This Place is a stepping stone job to move to another company. It is a place where it is hard to move up and to make any real money. "
good,"It could've been a lot better, it wasn't the worst work experience I've ever had though. The management seemed rather lazy, and expected the lower level employees to complete management level jobs while the actual management sat and ate grapes. The people hired and held at the position was questionable at best. The majority it's amazing how they passed the drug screening, if they even took it. They'd come to work drunk or high. They'd get paid to sit around and they'd even fall asleep with no consequences, but on the ones who actually did the work."
good,I don't have enough time with the company in my opinion to provide any details surround the company staff or customers.Fast paced-busy call center that developed over 3 years ago to make life easier for our customers.
good,If you dont have construction backround not a good place. you answer questions in all departments so you can get overwhelmed.
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. It definitely made the day go by quicker. I wish the had more employees and the employees they do had, I wish the would appreciate the hard work all of us put in."
good,management goes out of their way to talk bad about everyone and their personal private business. pay isn't worth it. nobody ever wants to help you either when you get overrun by customers and you're all alone because they don't know how to schedule people properly
good,"The way that the home depot runs their departments is very unorganized. The managers aren't not willing to help their employees. If an employee is having a problem with a customer, and they ask to speak to a manger, and the employee asks for a manager assistance and the manager doesnt come, you have to take care of the problem with the customer."
good,Good company for certain group of people who would like to engage in the things that this company offers to its employees while being employed there..
good,The individual stores seem to interpret the Standard of Procedure for the company as is relates to them personally instead of the total corporate structure. The pay is not consistent with the qualifications of the employees. Home Depot does not consider education or experience in their hourly workers.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers but the schedule varied day to day and week to week so you could not plan your life in advance. I understand that is changed now.  Also although I was more experienced I trained new hires that were being paid the same or  more than me simply because of the market when I was hired.  I was thrown into the flooring department and got stuck because no one else wanted to do the hard physical labor and the mental calculations involved. I enjoyed leading the Do-It-Herself workshops best as I taught ladies to build projects and learn tools.  The attitude of upper management was changing to treat employees as less like individuals and more like parts of a machine so it was often just the department supervisor and myself that were experienced in flooring.   Turnover became bad.
good,Home Depot has pretty decent pay and they are a great company to work for. But store managers there have no values. They are rude. Not much room for advancement.
good,Management have those that were very knowledgeable and those you wonder how they got promoted. I learned many things .  Overall did enjoy working there.
good,"It was very stressful to work there. Every year, they seemed to have a whole new management team with a new set of rules to follow. They were always understaffed."
good,"Overall working at Home Depot was and very educational experience, I met some great people along the way and I also learned great home improvement facts."
good,"I work in home depot , and I thanks the opportunity to have a job but what I have seen is way too low to tell they pay $10 to start then you have to wait a year for a raise that can not be more than 35 cents.the schedule is crazy specially part time.sometimes 3 hours a day and not more than 26 hours a week to avoid to paid health plans."
good,"Good environment, very hard work. Managers were not hesitant to go out and do hard work and get dirty with the employees, that says a lot"
good,"I was able to use a lot of my equipment knowledge, selling and handyman skills in this position. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to do the job that I was hired to do."
good,Enjoyed interaction with customers. Learned Purchase system. Met many great co-workers. Hardest part of job was the standing for 8 hours in one location.
good,Working for smiths was ok for a while but then you have to pay union dues which I don't like too because unions are useless money grubbing thieves. The hrs was good and the pay was good. I was ready to move on because of scoliosis.  scoliosis is a curves spine.
good,"I assisted customers in all departments. Had fun assisting customer with questions about produts and product use. My manager was   "
good,poor work ethic and are known to abuse the employees based on their knowledge however they are the ones not promoted. Management do not know how to perform duties of those they are above. They want more yet do not want you to work over time.
good,I was excited everyday to go to work to help customers. I found it educational and rewarding. The management style was sometimes on the edge of bullying.
good,"The People for the most part were nice; however, they fail to do much of any work and excessively complain about the job. The managers have difficulty executing plans that were given to them including transfers that were asked months ahead of schedule."
good,Too much turn over too fast. Inconsistent policies and management. Low increases. Lower hiring standards than in previous years. Under qualified managers in wrong positions
good,"i have not worked at Home depot for long but i feel as though the maturity of some of the folks there should be examined. Having not even made it out of my 90 day probationary period, i have already been harassed by a fellow employee and witness a harassment claim get filed against the same man...he still works there as do i. i do not feel comfortable in this workplace and hope to move soon. benefits are good and the pay is fine if one is good with customers and enjoys that  type of thing, but it is best that one keeps to themselves."
good,"ringing up customers and greeting them to my cash registers, helping them find any items they were looking for and thanking them for shopping with us."
good,"Very hectic and never enough employees. Managements expectations are unreasonable. Co workers are fun. The hardest part is keeping up with the work load while helping customers."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and cleaning up the department. Ordering the product kept me busy and putting the product away kept me physically fit. "
good,"they work you like an animal. do not get sick for an extended period of time. most of manangement is pretty fair to work with. co-workers were very nice, misery loves company. the pay rate for the job was very low considering what was required of you"
good,I learner to operate all types of forklifts and it helped improve my skills dealing with customers. The co workers are good the management is horrible. My typical day at work is driving a forklift and dealing with customers
good,this job was overall not that bad easy job and fun but theres no room for advancement and not good benefits at all. the managment was also a pain to work with
good,Good place to work when looking to be part of a team. Not a bad environment as far as the people but treat others as you want to be treated.  Elements are difficult during the winter months.
good,"I help troubleshoot customers electrical/wires problems for residential and commercial jobs. I have learned a variety of electrical needs. I have learn as little to read a variety of testers all the way up to wiring a entire house. "
good,Great place for women who are not carrying a high risk pregnancy to work at. Unwiling to work with the women who need to sit during their pregnancy and HAVE to work.
good,"Here is the truth. "
good,"I absolutely love what I do at Home Depot, I just am very upset with what I have to put up with on a day to day basis. When I clock in (usually early) it's more than likely I will be scheduled alone in my department (D21&22). I take 5 minutes to do a quick walk of my dept. and get a game plan (yes it can be done in 5 minutes if you know what to look for). After that I will take about 5 more minutes to see who is scheduled in sister dept's for the night (I'm the closer) and see the most effective way to get done what needs done all while promoting excellent customer service. "
good,"Very nice coworkers; enjoyed interacting with customers; learned a lot about various construction entities, great garden department; good supervisory guidence"
good,Work life balance is nonexistent. Management cares only about your number not your name. Company used to be great about a year ago but has really given into the stock market.
good,"As far as working around my school schedule, Home Depot was great to work for. As far as compensation compared to your knowledge, it needs improvement."
good,I started this job happy and motivated. Currently I feel like I am in a rut. I am a receiving associate and get paid $10 which is equal to the cashier in the front of the building. I work very hard physically and management doesn't do a great job rewarding the receiving associates for hard work.
good,"Had a difficult time at work because an overnight manager and supervisor was very biased towards me, hope this never happens to me again."
good,"Working day to day with customers on their home improvement projects,  Working with associates on merchandising and customer service"
good,Very Intense Job Environment driven by strict customer service policies.  The management was at times rigorous and over zealous with discipline.  Corporate HR was often consulted on matters that could have been handled in-house.
good,"The amount of work to compensation ratio is horrible.  In most stores, the advancement process is based on favoritism.  Although most customers are great and majority of the staff are very nice people, the management is very disorderly causing a very stressful work environment."
good,"Working at Home Depot was that bad. You had to deal with management assigning you to do something in a time frame that is impossible to complete. (Example: Bring in 60 grills from outside the building in less then a half hour, when your the only one working two departments) Made a lot of new friends while I worked there."
good,"work every department starting with garden, and anything that cannot fit on the shelves has to go into the overstock shelve above using various reach trucks."
good,"No work life balance, no opportunity for growth, stressful, poor raise but good coworkers. I have learned a lot on how to deal with customers and coworkers with a positive attitude."
good,"If you allow yourself to accept being taught something, you'd learn something new everyday.  "
good,"Good work, I worked as a cashier for 8 months i handled money and transactions every day. I liked that aspect although the work would get stagnet."
good,"All the work is given to sub contractors to complete at the lowest price.  Not an ideal way to operate."
good,Working at Home Depot I learned a lot about construction material. and many different supplies that the store sold. I think the hardest part about my job was the commute.
good,"Hard laboring job, Constantly under pressure and required to finish the set amount of work. Required to wake up very early in the mornings 4:30 a.m Required to be doing constant fast paced work, breaks are scheduled and can not be taken when desired. Must keep up with the pace."
good,They will use you up and pay you less than the new people and it is just a revolving door of employees. Not learning your job very well is an asset here.
good,Daily interaction with customers by being a cashier. Learned the cash register system along with the electronic scanners. Hardest part of the job at times was contacting the different departments for a price check only to not get someone.  The best part was greeting the returning customers with a smile.
good,Did not work there very long.. seemed like a safe environment to learn.  Was impressed with the number of people working in the offices.  The cultural environment is still in its infancy stage .. I'm sure will steadily develop.
good,"A typical day at work consist of handling the customers ASAP, get them what they want so ensure that they are satisfied with the product and pleased with the services rendered. The hardest part of my job came in stances when we don't have the product that the customer wants and I can't locate that product in any of the closest store.  The enjoyable part of my job was when I see the customer smiling on the services that I provided to them.  Most of the time management does not get involved, as I am able to locate the product and if I can't, will contact management and even other coworkers to see if they know another source for locating the merchandise."
good,Your job is what you make it. Its like high school. Pick your battles wisely or else you will be on the unemployment line real quick.
good,"Working for the call center that managed the Home Depot online department started out good. The environment in training made it seem like a good stable fun environment where people cared and cared about doing their job correctly. I can't say I really learned a whole lot I didn't already know about the call center environment. Management started out strong and caring, but towards the end of my time there it was very poor, not structured, not enforced and basically only one out of 8 supervisors on the floor was doing their job. Most of my co-workers took advantage of this and call avoided and the ones that didn't led to the hardest part about the job...taking back to back calls while those who took advantage call avoided to which management did nothing about it. I wouldn't say this is a place I would recommend...but the satisfaction it produced in helping a customer finish a home project or at least helping them find what they needed was half the reason why I stayed as long as I did."
good,I enjoyed the work and the people.  There was  a consistently change in the schedule or hours.  This made it hard to spend time with family.
good,This is a place to work when you are in High School or just coming out of High School. I was only able to learn about keeping the place clean and helping customers but wasn't challenged at all.
good,"The employees and customers are great without a doubt. I resigned the job because this is extreme hard physical work in flooring. Continually going up ladders and walking at least 5 miles a day aggravated my knees by walking on the hard concrete floors and going up ladders. Yes carpets and tiles are heavy. Now I am ok as I love to walk.If you work part time you get very little benefits and is very difficult to become a full time employee. The varying hours is also difficult to get used to."
good,"The most enjoyable part is working with the people I work with. Everyone is fun and nice. The scheduling is also pretty nice, they work around my school schedule."
good,Supported Customers through service to sales conversations. Managed inventory and transacted sales Interacted with customers and resolved service issues and request
good,"Hard work for little or no money. The people are friendly, so it would be  an enjoyable job for someone who only works because they are bored."
good,Low Pay and little to no opportunity for advancement. Management often does not know what in going on in the company and there is a complete lack of communication between store associates and corporate.
good,work/life balance was not good. Management had lots of illegal activity going on and harassed employees. Supervisor tried to teach me how to do things he was supposed to be doing and put more on my workload.
good,"Meet and greet contractors, DIY'ers, listen to projects, recommend and qualify proper tools and equipment needed to complete projects, last minute customer assemblies in addition to time sensitive customer repairs and rental inventory maintenance and repairs."
good,I dont really know how much someone would like working there long term. There is a lot of micro managing going on. The perks are that the customers are GREAT as well as most of the employees. Upper management really know how to be fake. They tell you what you want to hear but don't really mean it. I learned a lot during the short time that I worked there. I wouldn't refer or go back to this company.
good,"As a lot associate the work is very physically demanding.,Walking, pushing, lifting. The people and teamwork makes it a fun place to work. I've learned that advancement within the company is difficult yet possible with guidance from management."
good,"Though I enjoyed myself at work there was not a lot of room for advancement. There is no guarantee of hours, benefits, or full-time employment."
good,"I believe that The Home Depot is an excellent place for growth and development and work/life balance. However, i don't believe that the call center division of this company allows for this culture of The Home Depot to transfer over seamlessly. The Call Center environment covered in lots of red tape and politics could reduce the morale of associates and hinder healthy productivity toward the flow of business"
good,"A big part of my job at Home Depot was greeting and helping customers. "
good,Was overall a good experience and a stepping stone. Hours more generate towards the younger crowd if in school and older crowd who know the industry better. Although the pay is horrible and they have hardly any full-time staff due to the fact they do not wish to fork out benefits.
good,"For the most part Home Depot is just like any other company, they have benefits that are okay. The pay is a big fail for what they expect of one person, the communication is lacking to say the least and the management for the most does not actually take care of problems that need address. These are the reasons I no longer wish to work for Home Depot. The good side of the company is that they will work with you if you are in school and need to work around the classes. There is some great co-workers and maybe 1 great manager per store. It is an okay place for someone who needs a job."
good,Home Depot has a lot of great benefits as well bonus checks and extra pay on holidays. There are also a lot of possibilities to move up and get promoted. The only negatives are that the hours are crazy and its a very demanding job especially if you work in a busy location.
good,This is a great job for someone who does not have children. The work hours are hectic because Monday-Friday they open at 6:00 a.m. and close at 10:00 p.m.
good,"A typical day at work is  providing excellent customer service, solving customers problems in person as well as the on the phone."
good,Just like most first time jobs this place always tells your there is room for advancement but they will never advance you.  The benefits are better then most full time places.
good,"some SM's and ASM's give this good company a bad name, if your a good worker who newly hired SM's or ASM's don't like very much they will fire you for no good explanation. I did enjoy working for this company overall. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with customers and great coworkers."
good,"jobs alright but wages and raises arent the best as for advancement unless you get along with right ppl good luck,hours can be all over the place, can book days off well in advance they train you in some machine work but only valid at home depot"
good,La Cie manque beaucoup d'estime envers ses employés et ne respecte pas le cheminement réel de l'employé et de ses antécédents d'expériences de travail ainsi que ses compétences et ses qualifications de formations académiques professionnelles et néglige de promouvoir les employés dans des postes de travail plus adéquats et plus performants.  Alors les employés se découragent et quittent finalement cette entreprise. J'ai commencé à temps partiel et je suis toujours à temps partiel et avec des horaires hebdomadaires toujours variables d'une semaine à l'autre ainsi que les heures de travail car dans les rayons ou je travaille il n'y a eu aucune autre ouverture à temps plein depuis sept ans. C'est une entreprise qui embauche beaucoup d'étudiants à temps partiel et qui préfère un grand roulement d'employés au salaire minimum. Les heures des temps partiels sont réduis d'une semaine à l'autre... alors maintenant je dois me trouver un autre emploi pour subvenir à mes besoins financiers et aussi changer d'atmosphère plus saine et sécuritaire.
good,"If your a part timer make sure home depot your second job. The work hours are scarce depending on the season, almost impossible to live off."
good,"Fun job but management is poor, hours are distributed horribly. On the night crew you will sweat and bleed for $9.50 an hour. All the while fighting for 19 hours a week, including 4 hour shifts of 8pm to 12am on Saturdays. Amazing co-workers but just not worth it."
good,"I enjoyed the time training to work there. yes, the computer training can be a little boring, but once your out on the floor, you wish you were back there! everyone is helpful. If you respect the associates they are surprised into being respectful back.management needs a little refresher on staff interaction. they are phenomenal with customers, but if they were half as courteous to the staff, they would be more loyal towards the store."
good,This company offers an excellent benefits package for part timers and comparable compensation. This particular store suffers from poor management communication and too many secrets. This has been reflected in the recent staff turn over.
good,Training was easy due to being already experienced. Team work was a bonus. Management at times were unorganized and support for workers was hard to find.
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis. Mostly everyone was really nice and caring. At the store that I worked the assistant managers were uncaring and often times rude and crass. There were several complaints, partly from customers, about the decrease in morale at a certain point due to the hire of a new assistant manager."
good,"Decent place to work day to day, if you can deal with poor management. Overall enjoyable people to work with, and fairly predictable and easy workload."
good,"Management had become abusive and micromanagement the norm.  The idea that we ""owned"" our business died and all motivation to be entrepreneurial was stifled.  We truly became a ""big Box"" mass produced store.  Individuality was lost."
good,"was hired as a temporary garden associate, 2 months in, was offered a full time position. after accepting, I continued to work hard, when my initial 120 hire time was coming up, I was informed by management that they couldn't hire me because they had to hire someone else who helped them meet EOE requirements. management has since changed."
good,I have been here for about a year im still only part time as a cashier we have a lot more responsibilities then some of the employees that work on the floor and get paid the least.
good,"Good company to work for hard work, learned how to interact with management and  coworkers and to motivate people to get them to do what was needed  and to always say thank you or nice work"
good,"I enjoyed working with the public, that was the best. The actual work was ok sometime a little to repetitious as most jobs are, but I really liked working with the public in this type of environment."
good,Engagement Changes frequently so as a result you always have to prove yourself to new management the over all work is fairly easy but there is a lot of complaining about upper management from associates
good,"I found this job mainly because I could not find anything else at the time, while I was in a slump after oil prices dropped and I lost my previous job.  It barely got me by and upward progression was limited.  I drew the line after the local manager began to talk down to me in front of customers."
good,"Mangement pushed to execute higher level of work without appropriate compensation,  many demands for minimum wage earners then talk bad about them in staff"
good,"regular job, pay is ok, stressful, management not so good, benefits cool, ability to move up in company not so good. It is an ok place to work at while in school."
good,A good job for senior citizen that just wants to work part-time or a high school or college student.  No full time available or benefits.  The hours are not consistent.  You may work 12 hrs. per week or 40 hrs. per week.
good,"On an average day I will arrive about 20 minutes early for my shift to walk my area and get a mental list together of the days priorities, greet my fellow associates, and speak with management about their goals for the day. after storing my stuff away I jump into work completing tasks assigned to me as well as delegating tasks to my own staff and communicating to them of the days goals and expectations. "
good,Home Depot is a not as good as it seems. Management is very disrespectful to employees under and are very quick to insult. Management is very misleading and is willing to go far and beyond to make themselves look good.
good,"A typical day at the home depot consists of clocking in and getting yelled at by your boss because of what someone else has done or not done. I have learned how to create orders for the company and customers. I have also learned how to review the orders as well. The management in this store is disorganized. Some of the managers I worked with were nice and understanding but others seemed to wake up on the wrong side of the bed everyday. Management would also contradict with each other, one manager would tell me to do something and others yell at me for doing what the other manager told me to do and make me change what I was doing. I loved working with my co-workers they were all nice and very fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is working multiple departments with limited pay. They do not pay you for what you know or how many places in the company you work just the minimum they offer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we have our yearly party."
good,"I have nothing to say, this company was ok. It would have been nice if they paid more, and did not fire me when I found out I was pregnant."
good,"overall I loved the job very much, working with the customers and other team members, helping them to learn the values and the expectations of the work place"
good,"Corporate structure in my district was all into documentation-ie(put into writting all the bad things about you) so they can build a case to terminate you.  The pay and benefits are great if you are in management and make enough money to use the benefits.  My co-workers were great, but all had issues with transportation and working retail hours, which are all over the map.  Typical day involved stocking shelves, helping customers, then cleaning up after them.  The corporation keeps asking the individial to do more with less time and help.  So there is a lot of stress to get it all done. Corpoation is leveraging technology at a high level, I just wish with that came some consideration of the individual."
good,Very nice place to work. I assist customers with finding products for there home improvement needs. I learned how to work in a very diverse climate. The hardest part of the job was the swing shifts.
good,"Staff is overworked and not enough coverage"
good,"I always did as I was told, even went beyond my expectatons, wich is my idea of a good worker. I was always was happy to come in on and off day, come in early, stayed late, cut my lunch, even didnt take breaks for the store, wich was fine, but I didnt like how they dangled new oprounities in my face then didnt ever let me achieve them. I always kept mine and others work area clean and organized. A lot of customers knew me by name, described me as a great person and someone they loved to see. I not only did my job, but I also sold our credit cards A LOT and helped the customers with ANYTHING they needed and made SURE they were taken care of."
good,"A lot of work and not to many hours"
good,My Home Depot is one of the best retail places I've worked out but still not that great. The Assistant managers are great but the store manager himself is not so much. For our associates they are really good people and make the job completely worth it and as for the company policy itself its not that bad but there aren't that many who can say other wise.
good,"Great staff to work with, but management staff was not very helpful in the training process. The good managers didn't stay long. Customer service was a high priority but lack of staff proved to be a challenge."
good,"Each day seems to be busier than the next, and anyone on an afternoon shift will see time flying by with a seemingness unlimited number of customer service requests. It is a great environment for practical knowledge particularly for home-owners and teaches life skills along with typical job requirements from multitasking, customer relations and a wide range of expectations. Many problems arise with taking on tasks and retail duties out of areas of expertise, but with a large number of sales staff and floor managers there is backup around every corner. It is not always easy dealing with floor responsibilities and customer experience in an even balance, but the most enjoyable part of the job is how quickly the responsibilities become second nature and a routine is created as an associate."
good,Fun in conceptualizing design and giving ballpark price for kitchen construction for prospective client. You have to be very patient in understanding the customer needs to be able to help them.
good,"- Review scheduling, complete safety check list throughout the store, ensure merchandise is in it's proper place - pricing and available stock."
good,not enough pay; no over time; raises were minimal; management aloof I did like my team members and the job was fun in that there was always something changing or new to keep us busy and on our toes
good,"In general, the position was easy and not stressful, however, there were a number of hostile situations that met the attention of management, and nothing was done about it. Also, a lot of paper work goes mysteriously missing all the time, and most often than not it is important information. Very poorly manage all the way up to home office levels."
good,"love the poeple i work with, learn at of new things everyday. i love helping customers find everything they need and leave happy."
good,"if they force you, to be part time, they don't allow to keep and respect the other part time employment.  Every company got their rules, they know very well."
good,"During the first eight years (1993-2001) I loved going to work every day, never a shortage of challenges, always meeting new people, building relations with customers and associates, learning new ways to merchandise, inventory management, customer clinics were my favorite."
good,"The people you work with are the only redeeming feature of working for the Home Depot.  Assistant Store Managers and Department Heads are abused and Store Managers can be run off with no concern for team or dedication.  Since original owners left company, it gets worse every year."
good,"With the time I spent in Home Depot, I was fortunate enough to work with some amazing leaders. Some were fantastic, and some were not. The best part was the most influential people you met were not your supervisors or managers. They were your co-workers. "
good,"Sometime ridiculous hours. Not a very good life/work balance. Mangers are incompetent. Currently finishing a degree from a very good school, great work reviews and recommendations, and still passed up for promotion due to only working there a short time."
good,"i transfered my job from new jersey to florida,that was good,,but they took money off my pay,,cut my hours,lost my insurance,would not let me go full time,could not transfer to another store,,worked with great people ,,management was bad"
good,I stocked items unload trucks and service customers. I worked in the garden area so I learned a lot about lawn care.
good,in previous years was a decent place to work far as how management ran the store but has since went down hill
good,"Easy work atmosphere,good training and informative for anyone willing to learn other facets of home improvement. Fair hours and friendly staff. Enjoyed the overall work experience."
good,I have gained much knowledge working for The Home Depot and although I enjoy working with the company It would be highly beneficial for me to advance in the company due to my quality of life. I absolutely love the feeling of extended family at the workplace. everyone for the most part is nice. I have been working there 2 and a half years.
good,At home depot you deal with customers all day and your always learning because no one person knows everything and its a big store. Management is ok for the most part. My coworkers are wonderful a lot of good people. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping costumers that don't know what they are going.
good,This was a seasonal job that I got during the peak holiday season. The work wasn't hard and I was actually chosen because of my work ethnic to assist with an inspection of the store by the corporate managers. It was myself and 2 other managers that got ready for the inspection and when we passed the managers were acknowledged with gift cards but I wasn't.
good,"My day is very busy and jammed packed with tasks that need to be done,before I can go home.I have learned every aspect of merchandising for home depot.The hardest part of my job is the very very heavy lifting,it seems to be more of the norm lately.The most enjoyable part of my job,is seeing the finished product,and happy faces on customers and management."
good,"I was tossed into the department in a baptism by fire style and had to work my first few day with food poisoning because they were so desperate for people to work. "
good,typical day is a 8 hour shift correlating from busy periods to slow periods.
good,"great environment.  fast past, customer friendly, loud, home improvement"
good,a very busy workplace most days.a lot of walking was hardest part for me .company was too slow with advancement
good,not bad management could have done a better job. love working with people.
good,"not a viable job for single parents. hours are long. excessive driving. sporatic sales. no base salary. "
good,"Since the Home Depot of Minneapolis, MN was most focused on landlords and other contractors, there were a lot of regulars. The same thing every day, answering tons of questions and showing my knowledge of paint on a daily basis. Never a boring day. The management was awful, unorganized, and didn't seem to do much throughout a work day."
good,needs to work on developing the associates. very hirarchial
good,"A typical day can start at 4 am, with shifts ending at midnight.  There are some stores that have overnight management.  There is customer interaction throughout the day with sales, dispute resolution, or employee interaction.  You either need to have department knowledge or know who is on the schedule that has the department knowledge.  The company has gone from individuality of store displays to uniformity throughout to enhance the customer shopping experience by ease of shopping."
good,A typical day at work is repetitive. We clean and organize each bay. Placed accurate labels under each product. Restock when needed. Also note each of our duties on bay notes.
good,"I worked there full time during the worst senior management period in their history.  In all fairness, that is no longer the case; that chairman was forced out, but it is all I have direct experience with.  My understanding from talking to other people is that the situation has improved for the employees and the customers, but I have no direct imput to this."
good,Home Depot itself was fine. It was the actual security company that was difficult.
good,The day would start off slow at times and gets busy at noon. I learned how to maintain a good attitude and keep busy during down time.I enjoyed the celebrations for some of the associates. The hardest part was dealing with lazy coworkers.Most of the coworkers were nice and friendly.
good,It's pretty much what you would expect working as a freight team associate.  The work experience mostly depends on the store you work at and the management team there.  Outside of that it's just another large box store.
good,"Home Depot is a good entry-level job, but I highly recommend you do not get comfortable, for there is No Job Security which includes from management- floor positions, don't think because your a manager you can't get fired. I worked for the company for 4 years and I have always saw it as a stepping stone. Since I left the job I know managers as well as sales associates with 15 plus years for the company terminated."
good,"Home Depot does allow associates to move up, but sparingly. I started on cash register, went to paint department and learned to mix paint, went on to lead generation and honed sales skills, then went to flooring as a Specialist and is very successful. YTD I made the store $228000 in sales. I like working with customers and problem solving. I also helped train new employees. I am now looking for newer opportunites in different avenues."
good,Coworkers who always put customers first! Enjoy working with people who have the same work ethic as you do and a company who always strive to be the best.
good,the management wasn't that good but the associates were good people to work with.
good,a typical day is inbound and outbound calls to customers and home depot stores across the US to assist customers in the purchase and install of their flooring choices. what ive learned is skills more geared towards going the extra mile to have a situation taken care of . I suppose those skills are more customer service related  and self motivation. The management functions well for the company but not so much for the employee and their needs. The coworkers make the work bareable.
good,Working at The Home Depot is a good starting job. The management is ok. The stress level though working there is very high. Well at least for me.
good,The difficult part of this position was the constant standing and constraint of movement. Cashiers are required to stay within 10 feet of the cash registers. Co-workers were wonderful.
good,only offered part time hours with little or no opportunity for advancement. Management was always in chaos.
good,Home Depot isn't a bad company to work for. The pay relatively well and their benefits are very good. The facility you work in and the department you're in can make or break the job though. Management can be very demanding my facility and as a result morale is low and turn over is high. I have heard good things from people who work at different locations however.
good,Major daily challenge was balancing time between inventory control and customer service.
good,"High volume stores where business come first, customers and associates second."
good,"Home depot was a pleasant place to work but because I was much younger, I was treated equally by management."
good,It is a good position for a person just starting out. Little to no advancement
good,"Typically I reviewed inventory levels and store appearance consistently throughout the day. Directly ensuring that all associates, upper management  and customers were assisted promptly and effectively.  I learned a lot here, such as how to deliver results by providing world class customer service.  My co-workers and managers were really helpful and everyone was very respectful; there was an establish eight sets of core values and each person lived them.  The hardest part of the job was disappointing customers and the most enjoyable came from teaching, training and counseling."
good,"Home Depot can be an awesome place to work.  The store manager you work for and the various assistant managers at a store will be the determinant of your level of enjoyment while starting at home depot.  Their corporate culture will blow smoke and do a song and dance about how much they care about their employees but largely speaking that care comes from your co-workers and not the upper level management/executive level leadership.  If you enjoy helping people, Home Depot can be a lot of fun.  I loved my teammates and my managers with few exceptions.  The pay sucks and they expect a lot but if you're trying you'll do well provided your attendance doesn't become an issue.  Depending on store sales, periodic bonuses are possible but not worthy of discussing.  At my store the store manager was unsupportive as a manage, unfaithful as a teammate and lacking in thoroughness involving serious matters(other teammate's issue with customer and their employment).  Unfortunately, it disgusted me to the point that I couldn't stand working for him or the company that he was a reflection of any longer.  I don't know if other stores were like this or not.  I was not alone in my feelings or my assessment of the manager and while the store and the manager were very successful terms of sales, he had created a very negative environment for himself as the majority of employees were disgruntled about everything.  Hope this store was a rare one and I hope Home Depot realizes that they don't have to be like Walmart and changes CEO soon...executive leadership has made some bad decisions/alliances and"
good,"Stocking merchandise, I learned to prioritize on my own., Management sometimes were not professional and co-workers were trying to find other jobs. The hardest part about working there was not being able to ask employees or management for help without a no or not right now. The most enjoyable part was that working there made me want to better myself by pursuing a BA degree."
good,Unnecessary stress by management. Micromanage you treat you like a kid no matter your age. They have no idea what they are doing. I was a lumber asscoiate but was the only one that knew how to drive a forklift on the busiest days. You do not get paid extra for driving the forklift for the whole store.
good,i will never understand why if someone is willing to go the extra mile to learn during down time it's a problem
good,"Worked for a Dow Jones 30 Company Helping Managers with their Daily Workflow Activities"
good,Management was horrible. Diverse. learning experience. N/a
good,"As I said before, it is a good company to work for, but its tence and gruing and grinding.  You have to drive lift trucks, even if you don't want to.  I learned alot from lots of experenced associates and they were helpful.  You will do heavy lifting, so watch out for your back.  Getting along with co-workers are enjoyable and it could be fun too.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the coustomer who comw at all at once without knowing ask questions of what they need."
good,A typical day at work is to sell hardware to prospective consumers.  It was a busy day. There was a lot to learn.
good,Pallett building is brutal and is a younger mans game. I did work in Inbound receiving on second shift. I applied for pallett build to get on first shift. What a mistake.
good,I learned a lot as far as returning items when I was a cashier and as a merchandiser I learned a lot about inventory
good,"great place to work at. "
good,"I wish I could start over.  Hired for cabinet sales and ended up in appliances.  Part time schedule was closing more than not.  Days ended by moving larger and heavy merchandise without help. Closing included kitchen cabinets, bath, and appliance aisles. Incentives were difficult to obtain. I would not recommend to close friends."
good,scanning customers items and greeting customers as they come in the store
good,"Working as hard as possible 100% of the time, attempting to accomplish more than time allows. Inventory management, organization, department management. Co-workers were generally good, hard working people. The hardest part of the job was watching the company promise things to people such as full time positions in reward for their work, only to lay them off at the end of the busy season. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and the public."
good,"High energy, part-time only"
good,"co-workers are great, work load easy, enjoyable customers. I have worked long hours they give good benefits ."
good,"It was great place to work while i was in High School"
good,it was a good learning experience.the employees were very nice and willing to teach you new things.
good,MY typical day in paint dept I looked forward to.   I made friends I discovered things about myself.  the hardest part was having to be on your feet for hours....
good,"Typically my day at The Home Depot would consist of labor work, sometimes in extreme heat or cold. The hardest part is trying to do a two-person job when people constantly do not show up for work."
good,I enjoyed working with a handful of people here. Management were not considerate of your situation if sudden death or illness struck in your family. They only worked well with employees who would suck up and push others around. Pay was not appropriate for the workload and situations we were forced to work in. Not a pleasant place to work.
good,awesome team got to work with many amazing coworkers and to my surprise customers as well.  I was able to push sales and customer retention in spite of poor management (2 of 6 managers had desirable traits). my advice is find the people with people skills and let them present the problems and solutions you will find while working there
good,"liderazgo, administracion, capacitaciones constantes, buen ambiente en el trabajo, aprendizaje, pero se meten mucho en la vida privada de los asociados"
good,"I was a department supervisor there with keys (next step to becoming a assistant manager), my last department that I was in charge of was Hardware. I've managed anywhere between 5-8 people on a daily basis, and whe I'm the manager on duty. I was in charge of 50-100 employees at the time. I've made my department that was a 3.2 million dollar department when I first started in it into a 4.2 million dollar department within a one and a half year time frame. I've also was a supervisor in multiple departments of that store. I've ran Paint department, Building and Lumber department, and Plumbing deparment. Customer interactions is a every day thing and the most fun part of the job because I know that I have helped that customer in their problems with their home improvement project. I believe the hardest part of my previous job was the company standards with the new salaried management team. I still belive that Home Depot is a great company, however, when their mission statement funnels down to the store leve. A lot of it gets lost somewhere, and that is my greatest frustration with the Home Depot."
good,Not a whole lot of training. They train you by making you redo stuff for free. Holidays are very slow so the majority of the time you won't get a job during the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas.
good,"I started in Lumber/ Building materials being mentored by an individual that would always be outside smoking cigarettes and drinking soda leaving me to do more than my share of the work.  Coworkers here tend to have blinders on, some are fearful of being replaced or so it seemed.  75% of the customer base were nice enough, the remaining 25% are nasty with attitudes liing about anything to obtain a lower price for the item they're looking to buy. Management have pets that do everything but kiss the groud the managers walk on.  Some of the management give unauthorized deep discounts to their friends and family, others punch the time clock for one another so as to not seem late for duty.  The only positive I found was with the Hardware guys that made my day seem like fun."
good,"typical day: open paint dept, prepped machines for the day. I have learned many things to do w/home improvements. Management is less then desirable. co-workers for the most part are good people. hardest part of the job was to deal w/bad ideas by managers. the most enjoyable part was working w/good co-workers."
good,"Kitchen designers in  this company,particularly ones like myself with a degree in design,get no support or respect from mgmt or corporate. This company is geared towards a retail mentality,and doesnt understand or appreciate the intricacies of kitcen design,thus the necessity for a degree in it to do a quality job.They simply dont care how you do your job as a designer.Very unprofessional."
good,I only worked part time here it wasn't bad.  I was still living with my parents so the pay was ok for a single young person with no bills.
good,"Meet with customers daily to measure homes for flooring. Spend most of the day driving and measuring. The most important part of the day for me is, making the customers happy and putting a smile on their face, by answering their questions and arriving on time."
good,"part time is not great, dont see a chance for full time ,,and pay is low"
good,"A company that is forward thinking when it comes to technology and training of that technology. However, they lack training for management and the people skills required to run a customer friendly business."
good,"Busy busy busy    day went fast"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people in my department. We all work so well together, we have a fabulous working system that plays off of the strengths of each person. We coach each other, listen to each other, but most importantly help each other out as much and as often as we can."
good,"i enjoy my job designing doors and windows,and giving advice regarding-installation,learned good computer skills,managment not very helpfull with little experience,most co-workers helpfull and understanding,hardest part of the job covering several departments at the same time,the best part of the job is public contact"
good,"A typical day at work would include servicing bays, which would include repairing and/or replacing displays and fixtures, cleaning the bay itself, replacing damaged and worn labels, repairing product packaging, and packing down stock as needed.  While working at home depot, I've learned how to install toilets, sinks, faucets, and lighting fixtures, as well as perform minor repairs.  The management seems to be rather disconnected from the issues faced by employees, including health issues, as they maintain a system of demerits for absences, regardless of the reason for which an associate is absent, including bereavement and legal subpoenas.  Furthermore, many members of management have little to no understanding of proper hazardous material containment, clean-up and disposal, including biohazards such as various bird and rodent droppings, as well as dead animals.  Many of the store associates are willing to help as needed, while occasionally there is the odd associate who, for whatever reason, would be unwilling to help.  The hardest part of the job, as a man, is being required to lift anything that cannot easily be lifted alone, including anything greater than 30 kg.  Perhaps the best part of the job is being able to learn about many different things from the different types of and qualities of flooring, to the benefits and disadvantages of different types of lighting."
good,Company Policy is to lie to associates. Only people who are friends with(or sleeping with) management will ever have a chance of advancement.
good,"started at 9pm shift ended at 6am enough said, incharge of 10 employe's and stock, the hardest was the hours."
good,I cash people out and help customer when they need help with something
good,Go in to work and complete data entry information for interviews.
good,very busy at times and management didnt work with the fact that i was in school.
good,"Its a hard working job and great people but some co workers and managers aren't so great. Managers unfair to employees, a few racist confrontations between co-workers, a co-worker was sexually harassing females at work and management didn't stop him."
good,"I have enjoyed working there,worked with some great employees and some nice customers,but it is all up to you and the kind of person you are that will give you a positive work relationship.I have worked with good supervisors and managers, but that seems to be changing more now that before. I have seen some young people come in out of high school and work there way thru college."
good,pay is okay.But the schedule is hard to deal with since they schedule you whenever.
good,"Was a cashier but anytime I wanted to advance it seems they didn't have any openings for advancement and then they would hire outside for the spot you were wanting to apply for internally, I did learn a lot and enjoyed running the Kids Workshop when there but had problems with another employee that was brought to managements attention many times and the situation was never handled by anyone which in turn made me leave from the lack of management responsibilities being taken, hardest part of the job was handling irritated customers at returns without receipts or obviously stolen goods trying to return, but the most enjoyable was the kids workshop, I lived and breathed the workshop it was what kept me there till the end."
good,"I'm all for customer service, and the job is alright, but it really comes down to the coworkers and management. i work in what's considered the worst store in the district, and with reason. i feel like there might be room for growth in the company overall, but not in the particular store that i work in. That being said, I do enjoy getting to know customers and solving their problems myself, always a big plus."
good,Hired as night shift assoc. with no shift diverential compensation & no job security ( seasonal position ).
good,"I was a bilingual cashier. Helped many of my coworkers out. watched for the security scanners, making sure I did not witness any fraud. "
good,"This was my first time in retail.  I learned quite a bit about how the retail world works.  I found that the store management people were all approachable and very understanding and human.  District people not so much.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that my hours and work days were all over the place - from starting at 7 am in the morning some days and then starting at 4 pm other days.  No rhyme or reason for the crazy hours and days.  Best part of the job was that I felt that I was really helping people by answering their questions with good advice based on my personal experience with plants, etc."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is filled with back stabbing by management staff as well as peers within the organization. The management staff has their favorites and if your not one of them, prepare yourself for the worst job of your life. "
good,Salaried management like to manage associates with threats an intimidation.
good,The first thing i do is check my daily action list to check what price changes are due that day. make sure that counts for the week get worked before the end of the week. make sure that product has a location so that over people can find based of location given on the computer.
good,Managment is ok but there is little flexability with scheduling. Most people that work there are pretty nice. Some parts of the job can be labor intesive.
good,"I was a cashier. was my first job as a cashier and was not the best experience, but it was experience non the less.  "
good,"I learned through this job that communication is essential to the production and cohesiveness of a company. Although management is often not on the same page with each other, my co-workers do a good job of maintaining a family oriented environment. The hardest part of the job can be the multitasking aspect,which can be overwhelming at times if your time is not properly managed. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with a numerous amount of different people from all over. "
good,fun and learned to work with a variety of people however management has their own agenda
good,"This employer is good about working with college students but the pay is below normal for the amount of work required.  Management does not do a good job on training nor communication.  You learn a lot fast or you will feel out of place.  "
good,"The company was built on a strong foundation of taking care of it's people and respect for all.  Unfortunately, many of it's current managers have no sense of that foundation."
good,Home Depot was ok.  I worked with an interesting bunch of people.  I think most people will like it.
good,"Good if you need a job."
good,"Depending on the time of the year Home Depot can be very busy. If you are a cashier that means more stress on you. Management expects cashiers to do everything and they barely get rewarded for it. Going ""Above and beyond"" for a customer is suppose to be rewarded with a ""Homer's Award"" but in the store I work with Cashier's barely have any. A co-worker of mine has been there for 5 years and she is excellent but she only has 1! but people on the floor has over 10 and they barely do their jobs."
good,It was a very busy place to work. I loved my job for the first six years. I liked it the last three years. The most enjoyable part of working there was the opportunity to help people.
good,"standing for many hours on concrete floors. No way to have a life outside of work, Work every weekend, No time to do anything with family"
good,"I would most often be starting an opening shift at 6 am. Started off by unlocking the gates and then doing a sweep of the front apron. Then I would help customers throughout the day by loading their items. I learned that your customer service skills is never near perfect. The management was good, they took care of their employees. My co-workers were the best part of the job. They were all around my age so the day went by quickly. The hardest part of the job would be waking up at 5 am. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the sunshine majority of the time."
good,"did not like this place, they did not value or honor the employees. Decent chance for advancement and good clientel."
good,"Every day is hard and fast paced. There is a lot of work to be done restocking and cleaning the store. I learned a lot about retail and how to up sale the customer. The Home Depot has a great sense of team work. The hardest part of the job is the fact that you work as hard as you would in a warehouse job, but you are paid like you work at a grocery store. Management seems very stressed, and they tend to show it from time to time. This is very hard back breaking work and there are time where the money is not worth the pain. The best part of the job is helping customer solve there problems, even if they don't buy any thing. The fact of just help someone else with there issue and making there day a little better is amazing."
good,managment needs more training in how to positively inspire their people. Very negative atmosphere.
good,"The typical day at this establishment was essentially a big list of stuff to accomplish, and then you go home. It wasn't bad, but it was definitely a lot more physical than most retail jobs. I enjoyed the work, but the store felt desolate at times. Rarely did you see co-workers, and even more rarely did a customer need help."
good,"Home Depot was an OK place to work the supervisors and co-workers were fun to work with.The supervisors would joke around with you and stop by and ask how you were doing,they got to the point they could tell when something was bothering you."
good,"Home Depot is a very interesting place to work. I had new management almost every 6 months I worked there, they weren't too bright, and when the managers were bright, they didn't care too much about the store as a whole. I liked the benefits that came with the job and the breaks/lunch times, but I didn't like the atmosphere I worked in. A typical day is me clocking in, then going to the register my supervisor assigns me to, then ringing out customers throughout my whole shift. Sometimes they would need me to sell products to customers."
good,decent place to work/unrealistic work hours for someone with young children/disharmony among management staff/formed great relationships with someone co-workers/ too many part time associates with very limtd availability
good,Some friendly and non friendly associate's. The Management could have been way better.
good,"This specific job is good for someone that is a student, or looking for a temporary position while searching for something long-term. The only reason why I wouldn't recommend joining forces with HD is because it is like any other corporate giant. Poor management, poor management decisions, high turnover rate due to employee dissatisfaction with weekly schedule changes, and low pay for a large workload. Training was a disaster, payroll was a disaster, and my overall experience working there was a complete disaster and waste of my precious time."
good,there are some of the management that needs to be dismissed as they believe they are better than the employees that they are working with
good,it is ok at home depot. you often time feel over worked and under appreciated. the good news is the people you work with are for the most part friendly.
good,While working in this position I learned many skills that I will posses throughout my career. With that I will forever be appreciative. In the position I held no one else did my job which meant I had to be consistent and always deliver. Which in return I always did my job and beyond the call of duty without having to be asked.
good,Working here increase my skills with different type of people help better my customer service skills and handling different situations.
good,shelf stocking and departmental returns
good,A typical day at The Home Depot consists of keeping customers FIRST. The goal is to meet the needs of all customers and to make sure they leave happy and wanting to return. The Home Depot provides all of its employees with the training that is needed to be well informed. It is received either on the floor or through PC training. Management is usually made up of associates who have advanced or experienced employees through past employment. The hardest part of the job is the fluctuation of hours and low wages. The best part of the job is hearing customer's testimonies of how info that you gave them helped.
good,typical day was 6hrs of standing at a cash register and talking to the people. I learned to adapt to different computer systems for cashiering. The coworkers were a bit of a closed book they didnt like talking to others and that frustrated me. Hardest part they told me Id be a full time worker and on the floor in 3 months and I worked a year and never made it to the floor or full time. I loved working with the people :) seeing them and talking to them specially the guys who would come in every day.
good,awful place to work over worked all the time with minimul staff present outrages work hours with no help for lifting heave objects
good,Lots of lifting. You learn a little of every department. Management can depend a lot on where you work. Co-workers there can be a lot like high school even worse sometimes. The drama and the shifts.
good,You can't really talk to your co-worker.
good,"Experience depends on the manager of the store. The first store I worked at, it was possible for me to build a strong team and thrive in my department. The second store had an unsupportive and somewhat toxic environment. Manager did not back up department heads or solve problems effectively."
good,Management needs some help but the people that work there are awesome
good,"learn alot of home improvement it was a teaching store, okay on the hours and pay, management was bad all the way around, no room to move up"
good,"Taking care of customers, working the cash register, and manage self check out. Balancing a drawer."
good,"A lot of contractual business during the day, as contractors would make frequent trips during the day for various items. I learned to have a lot of patience, and to step out of my comfort zone and to handle tasks head on. Management was strong however they could be more available to associates and co workers were pretty friendly. The most challenging aspect of the job is handling a high volume of customers while being severely short staffed during peak hours. The most rewarding has honestly been having satisfied customers who keep coming back and asking for your help with their next project."
good,Working at the Home Depot was a good job to get customer service experience and help execute a sale.
good,"This company does not live to what it teaches to its associates. If this company strictly enforces what it teaches during orientation sessions with their associates, it could be a top rated company by employees."
good,"liked helping customers with problems.Hardest part of the job is the lifting of very heavy items head high and above,framed lrg.windows,cabinets,4 gls.paint at a time."
good,Cashier/Customer Services Representative
good,"started as a part time cashier. Before my probationary period was up, i was sent to classes and became a head cashier, shortly after training, went to the service desk and remained a service desk cashier for 2½ years before being transfered to Millworks as a specialist ordering doors and windows."
good,I worked in the Bookkepping department where I dealt with the cashiers tills and also the safe had to be at certain balance everyday at the end of the shift. I learned how important it is to make sure that the tills are correct and that the safe is balanced so the company does not lose money. The Management was good to work for and was easy to get a long with. I worked mainly by myself in a room so I didn't have a lot of people around me to work with. The hardest part of the job would be when the safe did not balance out I had to figure out where the problem was. I enjoyed this job because I like to work with money and also in office setting.
good,Poorly managed company with low morale. Develops and implements new procedures along with adding additional tasks without additional compensation or regard to the effects on the employees.
good,A very challenging company which requires alot of energy to work in. Once a store with alot of employees and alot of customers that has transformed into a company with minimal employees and a never ending workload.
good,"unload trucks, stock new product, management was alright, co workers were fun, learned a lot about home improvement, hardest part of day was paint, lifting couple thousand pounds of paint a night, break time and go home before 12am"
good,"is a interesting place to work at, I enjoy the staff that I work with"
good,The work atmosphere was fun and so was my job but some people did not like me or my position so they made my job a little less enjoyable
good,Few employees engaged with customer service.
good,"The Home Depot has a great system in place, corporate structure, and benefits to offer to employees. Management lacks in encouraging team members to grow within company. During summer heat, management did very little to keep outside workers hydrated. Other than that the company offers competitive benefits like medical, dental, and vision, as well as has a program to help employees who fall on tough times."
good,Provide lots of computer training but little hands on training. Management is hit or miss and makes all the difference on your experience. Are more concerned with numbers than function.
good,"coworkers were good.made some great friends.management was ok ,work was easy"
good,Love coworker and learn something new everyday. Not a lot of hours. Room to grow. Understand
good,"worked in any kind of weather, didn't get much help from others, poor management."
good,"Work schedules need improvement. There is morning, mid and evening schedules. All departments need knowledgeable associates available during all operating hours not just at the so call power hours. A lot of people shop after power hours, depending on their work hours. Waste, so much waste. Don't throw mark downs away, but re-mark them for sale. they will sale. Inventories, not very good, to many losses. Items in the binds/overheads with no location to sale the items. I still found that there are some really knowledgeable and helpful employees and the customers, 99% of them were great."
good,"The one I work for isnt't the best. A lot of favoritism is played and a lot of old ways are dying. They rarely give out any homer awards unless you're apart of the people management likes. The only thing I really enjoyed about the days are punching out. They have a crazy system where you need to ask for vacation time twice, which will result to you not getting paid. They fire you at the drop of a hat."
good,"As project specialist I function as the primary project manager for all orders initiated in my departments. I am responsible for managing the sale of large ticket items, such as carpet, hardwood and millwork installations, from inception to completion, to include after care when necessary."
good,Management and work/personal life not easy to balance. Random shifts.
good,"The main manager I deal with is a stand up guy, very open door policy, willing to help in anyway he can. The traveling to store to store makes for a different experience, but also leads to much wear and tear on vehicle. Co-workers are of the general mix, my supervisor does all he can to try and help you out. The much for advancement is not too good. Unless someone leaves or steps down there is generally no way to move up unless you transfer back into a store location and try to advance there."
good,"I've been working here for a little over a year and while I get paid decently enough it's not worth working under people who don't know what they're doing and refuse to actually do anything but sit around and hide in their offices all day. Then you have to worry about those who are not only not your boss, but are also lazy, yelling at you to do your job when they won't even do their own AND you are doing your job. Another Home Depot might be better but this one is run by idiots."
good,"The stand you at front, not allowing you to help customers"
good,A typical day consist of process and mange price changes.
good,55+ hours per week for salaried personnel (more 6 weeks prior to annual inventory)
good,Safety review of the dept.
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to get time off for certain event.
good,"High work load, short handed, poor management team. lack of equipment."
good,"I will admit that they are good about working with your schedule and the pay was decent. My problem was not so much with the entire store, just my department and the atmosphere. Not everyone is treated equally. There are employees who get away with certain things and those who stay in trouble. Their motto is ""Put customer first!"" but I stayed in trouble for doing so. Never have I had to resign due to the atmosphere and mood swings of a boss. There was nothing that could be done considering I had to wait six months before transferring to a different department."
good,A company that makes decisions without thinking about the consequences.
good,Consistent work load with providing customer service through product stocking or product knowledge for the customer. Over 600 + hrs of web based training in several areas of merchandising and store operations. The physical lifting of certain products would the hardest. helping a customer fix or build something is most enjoyable.
good,"A typical day depended on the shift that was given, when you opened the department, there were many tasks that had to be completed in a short period of time. Closing the entire department was cleaned up by one person usually. I learned how to make repair equipment in the store, assemble products, setup good marketing structures and signs that would catch the eye of customers. I also was given new coworkers to train who were assigned to me to lead in completing tasks and taught how to open and close the store. the hardest part of my job was the miscommunication that was constantly received by managers and supervisors to do tasks without sufficient or reasonable time to accomplish. the most enjoyable part of this job was that feeling of sheer accomplishment when a task was complete or when the department was closed and even when knowing a customer had received good service with a product they needed."
good,Management doesn't really concern their daily troubles with associates in mind. They tend to look out for themselves.
good,The people were enjoyable but the company itself was very disorganized. Company very demanding about working hours.
good,"The Home Depot will continue to do well, they just cycle through management so rapidly that no consistency will be reached."
good,This company is very focused on learning all aspects of the position as well as an overview of the entire company. They provide computerized training for all facets of your position.
good,"work all hours, even overnight. bad, bad, pay. But can quickly move up in company if willing to give up your life"
good,"No comments on working at Home Depot. I worked there for a long time, the solution to most issues at a large corporation is fixing the leadership at district levels."
good,Good job for teens looking to make money other than that it very fun just pays good and there super strict about what u do.Suoer good first job loved it for a little bit then just got tired of it because I worked alone with no help 4-7 days of the week
good,"el ambiente es muy relajado, no hay precion laboral"
good,the atmosphere wasn't help every customer it was doing your job and stick in your own apartment. I'd like to walk the floors and help every customer that came through the door but I was told I couldn't do that. I believe the culture in there is adequate. Management is adequate.
good,"Enjoyed my job until we got new management, they became lazy and careless. When we called for manager to assist a frustrated customer they would take forever coming out of the office or just send someone else."
good,at the Florence home depot the management doesn't really do a good job running the store. the associate are real fun to be around and know how to their job.
good,"Did not really like the work and family time balances they had there. You have to fit your family life around home Depot time, so I wasn't too happy about that."
good,"Our days consists of loading and unloading, stocking, and providing customers with exceptional customer service. Great company to work for. The team is nice and very helpful. Management can be challenging and unfair at times. overall, I would recommend."
good,"They are good at celebrating national and local holidays with good food prepared for associates. There is opportunity to learn on the job. But at times, managers are prone to showing favouritism which is quite obvious and doesn't help with team morale"
good,Good company to work for unfortunately its slow season and not many hour for work.  Consideration should be given for associates working with seniority even if they are part time associates.  Everyone should have a working schedule every week.
good,"The way to succeed at this place is by kissing butt and selling credit cards, that's all they care about. Management seems genuine at first but are just very good at wearing their BS mask. Other than that it was decent."
good,Not a great company personally to really work for the managers are all idiots and they shouldn’t even be managing an office max....they just won’t everything.
good,Management seeks to use favoritism and make you feel unwanted. Not care much about associates.  Most managers are not professionally trained to communicate with associates
good,Enjoyed being employed by this company even though supervision was lacking and management plays favorites. There was plenty of work and plenty of employees to help show the ropes
good,"They pay well and give you many hours at first however out of seemingly no-where they will cut hours of all part time employees, No employee discount."
good,Home Depot is a fun work place but not if you have young kids the higher you get in the company the uglier you schedule gets and as a single mom it is hard
good,If you're not a manager then don't put too much effort into your job.The people in charge love to play favorites and take advantage of people to ensure that their bonuses are as large as possible.
good,"Corporation is everything. There are such strict controls that a qualified person is not rewarded for individual action. Everyone is treated the same whether you work in the lot, or have specialized training for a particular job."
good,"Can use some improvements in certain areas such as product shipment errors, order errors, low pay distribution due to split  pay percentages.  Pay-out errors and pay cycle should be weekly."
good,Working at home depot was ok.. Not the best communication when it came to work or even just friendliness socially between the staff but other than that no problems
good,"Good, stable company; preferred schedules-that lets you work a set schedule; they work with associates for time off; training can be a little skimpy; hard working environment"
good,"Coworkers are nice, but management isn’t the best. Not easy to advance in the company, takes a while to get a raise. Lots of micromanaging, also not a lot of recognition for work."
good,Working at the Home Depot was a pleaser but they did not give me enough time to work and management was not great. If I was to change one thing it would be that I could have had more communication between my co workers
good,Was let go because management didn’t do job correctly. They make you work through your break and if you do work through break you don’t get one. You can’t use the bathroom or get lunch when working on a truck even if you’ve been in the true for 3+ hours. No appreciation for work.
good,"It's a good company, but in my role there was not a good work/life balance. Otherwise, it's a good company to work for depending on your position, mindset and your goals."
good,"I liked most of the people I worked with, management at my store was terrible. Lazy managers, favored certain people regardless of their work ethic. Bad pay but flexible hours."
good,"The Home Depot I worked in was perpetually under-staffed, so working in plumbing, was often pulled away to help in areas in which I had less expertise.  Customers were often flustered and impatient as they floundered in lumber and paint departments that were not staffed properly."
good,Company needs to pay employees a better rate of pay. You have people that have been there over 10 years & not even making $13-15hr? Company waste alot of money by not giving employees discounts on products that they throw away in the trash which impacts the environment!!
good,"the company is great if want to grow, but the task and job is demanding and you almost have no help with you fellow employee or management. Not enough hours are given to make end meet  or the pay either."
good,"It's an ok job but when they ""think"" you are doing wrong they don't give you a chance to explain just jump straight in as you've been doing this all along. There's too much favoritism shown towards certain people. They talk about co-workers without knowing facts - so it's just hearsay."
good,"The company gives employees decent benefits, and for the most part they work around your schedule if you're part-time. Terrible pay, and the company and managers care about nothing but customer satisfaction and good numbers, though they're too stupid and greedy to realize that they need to satisfy their employees in order to satisfy their customers."
good,Need more employees on sales floor and need spotters to have more knowledge on their responsibilities and be hold accountable and have more certified equipment operators
good,"customer service, cashier, scheduling"
good,"Home Depot is a very stable company to work for. Scheduling is not beneficial to work/life balance. Pay is very low compared to other similar companies, but advancement opportunities are available."
good,"my days can be very stressful or high-paced about 95% of the time. The hardest part of my job is when i am working alone and theres nobody to help, but i manage things the best I can. Management tries to do their best with what they have for employees to help other departments out if they can. I have learned so much from working there anything from planting plants to doing some electrical to ordering parts for customers to problem solving to cut boards to running a fork truck in all kinds of weather. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer comes back after i have helped them and i get to see the final project all done and hear about their experience."
good,Don’t really have anything to say because I’m pretty sure all Home Depot is different I don’t know how long I will be working there I just need something better
good,Meet alot of friends at home Depot. The management was not the greatest. The culture of the company is good. They do alot of promoting with in the company
good,"Only part I enjoy about this job is my coworkers. Other than that, I'm getting less excited about being here. Management often times do no understand that one can have schedule conflicts, and would not compromise with one. Being on the front end is not a cup of tea either. Favoritism is shown. Also, when one is not able to get a credit card application, management would often threaten to write them up. Unfair treatment."
good,"It was ok. It was just my specific position that wasn't great. As a cashier I had a great time at my first Home Depot but when I transferred for college this new Home Depot just had a different management team and I generally felt drained after everyday at work. So I switched to lumber from cashiering and while I was free from my terrible cashier supervisor, I had gained a huge workload by having to clean up the building materials department (concrete), lumber, and millwork (doors) all on my own for most nights. It was genuinely too much work for what they were paying so I quit. That being said I really loved working at my first store."
good,"Home depot is a decent job to work for. Working there when you first leave high school is recommended, but working there for a career will not get you as far as you want to go."
good,Don't work here if you expect more than a childish atmosphere. You will have cliques everywhere and the managers will also lie straight to your face. The Store Manager is absolutely fantastic! I wish it was his final choice and I wouldn't have been terminated.
good,best part of the job is the fact that i am not sitting down doing nothing always something to do wether its loading or unloading customers product or getting merchandise down for customers
good,"This company does not value employees previous work experience, in engineering or fairly compensate for experience. Managers in Houston store 0566, were the worst people to work for, they didn't care about or help employees. The manager at the 3821 store are very reasonable, good managers, listen and assist employees with work and life issues. Great team at 3821 store."
good,Over managed    theory based  non realistic expectations  .  abundance of  guidance on what not to do .  no  guidance on what to do -  regularly disappointed on outcomes.
good,Toxic and knee jerk working environment with no clear path career advancement opportunities. There are no clear communication channels with regards to management to department heads/supervisors.
good,Competitive pay rate is desirable  and a well oriented schedule over time would be great but not manageable for living capacity and it’s not affordable to living coasts
good,"Home Depot was my first time working in a home improvement warehouse. Management was good, training was excellent, hands on training was good. You are paid to stand at a register for 8 hour a day and help customers."
good,Working for the company is ok. Need better communication from manager to the employees. Better and more steady hours. There is some flexibility with the schedule when hours are available.
good,"No matter your position you get paid poorly. Management expects you to do your job plus theirs, if you don't then they do whatever they can to make your life horrible there. They push and push until you finally quit. The hardest part of the job is how so many people at The Home Depot don't care. Even if you are the type of person who tries to make a change they just ignore it and move on because that means they would have to listen and care about some ones concerns!! The Home Depot is not a place I recommend to anyone, Unless they get new managers and a new store boss"
good,"If your looking for way to start build experience. Thats a good place. Management is okay, they dont acknowledge good workers. They put alotnof pressure on the workers who are willing to work."
good,Need improvement; part time employees could be offered some more incentives.  It is an okay place to work. I hated working in the garden center. Too hot and too cold
good,"Home Depot is an honest company, willing to work with your schedule. Family-oriented and fast-paced. It's a warehouse atmosphere so comfy shoes are required."
good,Management wont work harder than the employees. Management is lazy an unconcerned about team effort. Favortism is high in but pay is worth it. Bonuses arent great and those who work hard get let go for stupid reasons.
good,"great employees and work enviroment, but very little chance for advancement. The scheduling is somewhat flexible, but there is no consistency. There are weeks that you'll be scheduled in mornings, evenings and overnights all in the same week."
good,Its a fast pace and working at nights people are very weird. Try avoiding working in the night crew only do it if you have too. Other than that the management as they listen to your concerns.
good,Company threw me under the bus after the management approval.  I was  dedicated manager that was customer focused and wanted to accomplish the goals for the company.  I believed in the company culture but I found that the company does not believe in their own published culture.  I am very disappointed.
good,"It's a good place to work while you're looking for a better job. The pay is not great. The store I worked at was understaffed. You were expected to keep the shelves full and still be available for customers. The store manager was great, very encouraging and motivating. The assistant managers were problematic."
good,"At times it is a very fast paced customer oriented place. The management team is very do as I say not as I do type of team. Very few of them will get out there and work with their associates. When you go to them with concerns they tell you to ""handle it"". More worried about what people think they look like then showing them."
good,"very stressful environment, management is clueless. would work for company but some stores are terrible. if you get full time which is rare no matter what they say benefits are a joke."
good,"Overall, Home Depot is not a bad place to work. My specific experience was not good. My compensation was low balled every time I qualified for advancement. Resulting in my quitting the company."
good,Once you start working here they say that you can grow and advance in the company but management has favorites and sticks to their small circle to build them up. You have the opportunity to cross train but they don't wish to raise your pay for more that you learn or do. There is loads of gossip throughout the store and drama and cliques. There is time where employees slack on their job and duties and one person in the department has to pick up their slack. Also lots of call outs. What I enjoyed is that you get to work with great people and you meet the regular customers. They also have some money bonus possibilities but its larger with the amount of hours and years you've worked there.
good,"The Home Depot call center offers recognition to top performers.  The training process is good.  However, management makes promises of the ability to advance within the company.  Unfortunately this is a political / popularity process, with an internal process that dismisses previous experience in other call centers.  Likelihood of advancement would take years.  Supervisors have little to no previous leadership experience, due to Ogden, Home Depots career pathing."
good,"As a forklift driver I'd think they paid a bit better. Expected to go out your way to help others then management complains your own work isn't done. I see favoritism from management and sometimes employees get warned or written up for trying to help a costumer out of your dpt. or vise versa for not helping the customer ??? managers aren't in the same page."
good,"Variable hours. "
good,"Worked 16 yrs , let go because of company policy that ASM followed for associates and not themselves.Loved working for company but management leaves alot to desire"
good,"In the end, it was a revolving door. I did not recognize coworkers because they were always new. All the managers were completely different by the time I left. I gained customer service experience."
good,"Meh, they cut my hours and tried to get more but to no avail. A lot of rude customers, short staffed, and the training is from videos rather than from an actual person"
good,They're a great company but they lack in communication and cause a lot of internal conflicts amongst the employees. They constantly put you in stressful situations in short notice and they do not help you when you ask.
good,"Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Sometimes receive conflicting or unclear instructions from management.  For example, safety requirements state not to be disturbed on the forklift, but got in trouble for not being available to help customer while using the forklift.  Asst store mgr had all associates go help unload Christmas trees while leaving the store empty.  "
good,"The Home Depot is a good place to work only if you want to make a quick buck. The associates are pretty cool, at least at mine. I barely learned anything from this place except how to sweep soil & mulch. If you’re stuck in Garden, get out! You have to deal with snide rich people most of the time. I was a PT associate so the benefits were trash & so was the pay despite getting $12/hr. Can you believe they don’t support employee discounts? Me either... If you don’t finish something within a certain timeframe because you have to deal with customers you are deemed lazy & get coached or a strike. I told management many times about OSHA & NFPA violations but they were never resolved."
good,They will try to minimize your disabilities to fit their needs. Even with written proof of disability they will put workers in departments they shouldn't work in
good,"Managers at my store would break store/company policy just so they don't have to argue with customers, making me and my peers look like chumps. A few will demand you to do things not in your job description and threaten to write you up if you say no."
good,"Fact paced work environment, safe work environment, horrible pay but guaranteed 40 hours a week. Overwork their employees. Other then that good job for someone fresh out of high school."
good,"Some stores are better to work in than others. I worked at Gainesville, TX Home Depot. At first it was great. But very soon I realized that management was terrible. They suck at scheduling and delegating. They will not take responsibility for mostly anything. They will blame the associate to save themselves. They never schedule well. You get some training but they will throw you on the floor by yourself and you will have no idea what you are doing and the customers are savages."
good,"I had put a lot of energy into this company in hopes that i would be able to move up in my career only to find out that, no matter how well your interview went... Most are already preselected."
good,"It is a good place to work but there is a lot of walking, odd schedules, very little chance for advancement and low pay. The work atmosphere is good and the associates you work with are great for the most part."
good,I did like working at homedepot the culture was fun and the pace was right up my alley but the pay is a bit low to live on and the fact they don't give employees a discount of any kind was a bit hard to swallow.
good,"Open and Close Tills"
good,"Not a bad place to work as far as retail goes, could use an increase in wages for freight.  The staff and management were great to work with.  Need to be more aware of people who are not slacking all the time and not pulling their weight and reprimand then accordingly."
good,store manager is barely present through th store and people get paid more than others who work harder than most tired of their excuses. people that bust there butt do not get anything out of it
good,Typical manual labor job not much else to say. If we get a big enough truck or two floor trucks it goes by quick. Unloading is probably the most arduous task but not too back breaking. Receiving > Freight anytime
good,"Their Value Wheel is garbage.  Starting wage is 15 but by 6 months you'll be at 16. The only time you get all your hours is peak season and OT is rare except for some mandatory Saturdays during Winter peak. Do not apply in the summer, there's too much VTO and no work. Management tries to get you to say any injuries that happen on the job aren't their fault. Just. Don't. If you value yourself as a person."
good,I enjoyed my time there however there is a lot of responsibility and not a lot of management to turn to. They preach that they are there but time again they did not have our backs when it came to conflict with fellow employees.
good,A typical day is very aggravating because things are never in order which makes it difficult to work independently and vigorously plus it needs tremendous improvement and dramatic changes also fairness to the employees.
good,"I would consider this a job of last resort, the company is trying its best to cut costs, by eliminating full time positions so that they don't have to pay medical insurance, which is a joke anyways. most of the managers\supervisors could care less about you as long as you are meeting store goals. You're just a body filling a space and are easily replaceable."
good,There is no coverage most of the time for people to take breaks. It is sometimes busy and sometimes slow. The hardest part of working here is the customers can be rude. Like they look down upon you. Management can be understanding but not all the time.
good,But u get down time especially if you been there a minute it’s very cliquey get in the right clique and you can make great money and get away with anything
good,"place good to work,all know each other like family,management they did not like that{new manager}.customer were friendly and comfortable because they know you.they said tell customer to  not talk to me,do not take coffee from customers.most part of my job supposed to fix tool not deal whit customer but never happen especially last 2 years.i help them different area even i did not have too,but i am team player."
good,Friendly place but poor management and can be time to time fun place and good place for learning if have good material oe class to teach u whatever u can.
good,"From what I hear, other stores were much different than the one I worked at. Although I generally liked the co-workers I had, salaried management lost touch with reality, only seeing what corporate wants, not what's working. Much of the time, cashiers were ignored and had to go without only to be talked to by salaried management for not doing a better job. Salaried management has hung up on those in need in order to avoid helping their own. They were very unreliable. Supervisors were a different story. Most of them helped their associates and coached them in times when they wanted to learn or needed help. I would have quit a long time ago if it weren't for the dept. supervisors at my store. "
good,Working out in the lot at Home Depot is a physical job that requires a lot from you. You essentially get paid to cross train and do things that aren't your job. Okay for a small period of time but not worth it when other places will pay you better for a fifth of the work.
good,I enjoyed working there. Somewhat of a relaxed environment. They are very strict when it comes to the policies in place. No real experience needed to work there.
good,The job's ok mostly. The other employees are mostly nice. But the management kinda sucks(In my experience).                                                                .
good,Pay isn't bad starting out but the benefits are horrible. Might as well flip burgers after your benefits come out of your check. Pay sucks until you hit management.
good,"Had fun mostly driving the forklift and helping out customers, I'd recommend not to get brainwashed into going fulltime unless you really need it. Great part time but terrible management in my facility."
good,There was a disconnect between the team and store. So many different personalities (not in a good way) and cliques could be good if everyone worked together.
good,Sometimes you can find a coworker that’s willing to help you at all times even when management can get very lazy. Customers help the day go by faster but also can be rude because customers come first.
good,The long shifts is not what I wanted. Job to physical for 9 hours shift exposed to the weather. Other co-workers did not do their share of work. I have good work ethics.
good,"It’s a great place to work if you’re looking for a part time job. If you’re full time, they want to work you like a dog until you can hardly move. It’s not a great place to work but it is good if you are part time."
good,It's just a stepping stone job to get where u really want to be at in life. A day there is very long and some customers are very rude but you do have good days just like any other job.
good,its a fun place to work but the management is having a power trip. you also have to be ready to deal with rude customers and know a lot about the department your in.
good,"Everything had to be self thought, a lot of turn overs so you have to be on your ""A Game"" all the time. Management was fairly new to becoming management so we had to figure out how to operate the system our self's. Associates worked well with each other, the hardest part of the job was filling in for people who would call in, managers did not handle call ins well or would find out to late. Communication was the issue. Enjoyable, they would buy us food and munchies at times once every month,"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me working with my fellow co-workers and every day customers including the regualars that typically come in every day for various projects. "
good,"Working for the company itself was alright, but management was horrible. Too much turnover and the managers who were there were not looking out for their employees."
good,It's a good place to work like every place it has it's workers that slack off and you have to pick up that slack because things need to get done.some of the managers need work example getting angry with an employee for asking questions about stuff they don't know everything about and needed help also they have a problem with making sure things in the store are working properly and are slow to get fix it's put to fix said machinery
good,A lot of people who did not have good work ethic or little experience would get raises and opportunity to move up.  Those who actually tried their best to move up and show amazing potential would be ignored and dismissed.  Management at The Home Deport unfortunately is inadequate. There is a lot of favoritism.
good,"if you want to grow with in the company,  you'll need to put more effort into management, be a lead generator or a credit card generator. they will not grow you if you dont push it. they hardly ever offer you a full time position. i'm been stuck in same department over 4."
good,"A typical workday was eight hours after my full school day. My coworkers were friendly to me, but not to each other. Sales were everything. I learned to state my boundaries at the beginning of a job so I couldn't be taken advantage of like I was. The only enjoyable part was the occasional free food."
good,"i would not recommend unless you would like to lie your way to the top. There are nice people there to relay your messages to, but responsibilities that aren’t yours, will soon be yours due to poor management"
good,"A typical day at work is good depending on what type a client u have assigned to you. Ive learned how to do different thing with clients that they are facing as far as certain health issues like feeding tubes, colostomy bags etc. The management is excellent, very nice and professional and understanding. The hardest part of the job is when a client dies. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the clients and seeing that their needs get met daily."
good,"It's a good job for a teenager to get, other than that there's no pay raises and some positions are expected to work in countless other positions. hours are constantly cut."
good,"Very good company but pay too low. Also lots of favoritism if ur the golden people lol .."
good,La empresa es buena pero no hay crecimiento laboral
good,"I'm not going to speak badly about the company I just saw alot of things that I didn't like.I would ask to get certified on equipment that I used in the Army but it would get avoided or brushed off I use to see co workers with less experience get promoted over me I have close to ten years as a store manager but at Homedepot it was who likes who? "
good,Management is all over the place. The worst communication from a management to associates i have ever seen in any store. The main positive of working at the Home Depot is the fact that associates are always helpful and really work as a team.
good,"Lots of incentives and upward mobility opportunities are promised during on-boarding, but after nearly three years this has proven to simply not be the case. The majority of the associates are incredibly friendly and willing to help fellow employees, but the individual store management is hit or miss. Rules are followed differently according to who is in the store, and in general there are just too many empty promises given out that I don't trust anything I'm told about bonuses or future full time openings. This company tries, from a top-level, but it feels entirely too often like middle management is pocketing everything that corporate tries to hand down to store level associates."
good,I didn't get the hours I asked for. The environment was okay. Customers often were angry because a majority of the on floor associates were never where they were supposed to be so when you call and ask another employee for assistant no one would ever show up. Other cashiers would constantly complain about this but the issue never got resolved.
good,Offered good training. Lacked in coverage on floor causing you to answer question in other areas that you had no knowledge and unable to find other personnel to help.
good,"Management micro-manages everybody. They tell you when you can take lunch. they have a bunch of women in charge who do not know their jobs at all, which in turn makes it very hard too be told to do the wrong things. The schedule is terrible, sometimes they will have you by yourself for the whole shift, which makes it very hard to take a lunch or take a break."
good,"Management does not do what they tell their associates they do. They bend the rules for certain ppl, play ""favorites"", ect. They put all the work on the same employees, while other employees walk around and do nothing all day."
good,Depending on who is the manager of the store the work environment could be great or not! My experience was just a place to work for a check since the manager lack from skills of how to manage people
good,"It's a job. Work hard, work every weekend and you'll still be part-time. They will always keep you at about 38hrs so they don't have to give you benefits."
good,"no complaints for the home depot. Deep down I feel as though they are using their employees. You sign on as part time, there is no option for full time unless you enter as a manager..... No health benefits unless you are full time - which from sounds of it, takes near a year's worth of part-time work. Head Cashiers get paid only a $1 extra over the minimum / normal cashier pay. Cashiers are given a goal to reach an amount of credit cards, yet given no reward, just a lottery gift at end of month, and a sticker... 35cent gum was given to all employees for saving the home depot nearly $20k in merchandise that was almost intentionally or un-intentionally stolen by customers. You are audited on something that wasn't taught to you, you learn by getting in trouble. Training is pretty much self-taught. The days can be very boring, or very rushed, there is no in between. I still do like my time at home depot, but with all that said, I would not suggest it to anyone looking for a job tbh. Your times that you work, are scrambled, no consistency, however if given early notice, you can ask for a day off in the future or even a shorter work day - both of which do need approval by manager but an option. you learn about prices of trade goods which is a plus. enjoyable part of the job are the times customers bring in their dogs, even though store does not allow them.."
good,adequate place to work. Friendly staff.  not much room for advancement. VERY inconsistent work hours. Management is friendly and helpful. Ongoing training every month.
good,I was a student at the time and the extra spending cash i made was a great way to make sure i wasnt starving and an even better place to make some good friends but the wage and benefits weren't exactly the best for the workload given
good,"descent place to work. i would not recommend staying for numerous years. but The Home Depot is a good place to earn valuable skills as customer service and machine operations, such as the Forklift"
good,"I've worked at the Home Depot for almost 3 years now. I loved it for the past years, but management has been horrible now and really impacts everything, as far as for me it made me not enjoy my time working at the Home Depot. Just a good temporary job."
good,"In the late nineties was hired and was a much more professional group sought in hiring process to the floor,it was competitive and driven to excel,then management and district managers were being terminated,it all changed on how they took care of their own people."
good,Wanted to work as a part time cashier however I always got scheduled 30+ hour weeks. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that Home Depot associates all got along really well.
good,"While I was an employee I took it upon myself to learn several roles; I worked the lot, the garden department, the paint department and the lumber department. I also learned a few skills regarding electrical and flooring, however not enough to feel confident enough to work solely in those departments. I worked greatly varying hours from day-to-day (early one morning, close then open the next) and was never really given a consistent schedule. "
good,"The Home Depot is not a place that I would recommend building a career around. It is a job that I would recommend to a college student looking to get some work experience. "
good,"the Home Depot that I work in is a stressful place with people watching your every move. the management for the most part is terrible, they are good people but overall bad at managing. the work place culture is a mix between 16-19 yr olds just working for a pay check who could care less about the job to 19-25+ yr olds who either take the job very seriously or who try to find any way possible to slack off.  The hardest part of this job is to stay busy and active yes there is a lot to do but if it is a slow day everything gets done fairly early and you find yourself sweeping the floor for an hour. The most enjoyable part of working at The Home Depot is some co workers are really nice to be around and work with, you have a work place friend that helps you when you need it and doesn't distract you from actually doing your job."
good,"Easy job , Gabe opportunity to learn a new skill but the way hours are set up really suck last if you have adult bills, everyone starts off as a part time worker and hours vary . If you need specific hours don’t apply it’s like an as needed basis on hours not structured 40+"
good,"The company was a great place to work in the beginning. Over the years it got less and less enjoyable to work there. Raises were decent, management was easy to relate to. The later years morale was low. Even for those who probably wouldn't admit it."
good,"As much as I loved working for this company, the hours and pay is very poorly. There’s not a lot of chance to grow, make more hours or do something with a better pay. Love my coworkers tho."
good,"Nice place to work.A fun challenging work environment where team work is held at a high level.A continuous learning environment with understanding and passionate management, eager to teach and help you grow in the business."
good,They are willing to teach anyone who wants to learn but only promotes males under 25. Management plays favoritism and doesn't hide it. Always make minimum wage.  You'll get a raise of $0.35 once a year and then state minimum goes up $0.50 and erases that raise so your back at minimum.
good,I was stunned to learn that flexibility is a major guideline in working for the Home Depot. It can be a normal practice for someone to work till closing one day and will have to come back the very next morning to open up the store for another shift. Team members have no real say in what shifts they re scheduled for.
good,The most enjoyable part of my jobs is my customers.  I enjoy the relationships I have developed with my many customers and some of my co-workers.  I have dedicated 14 years to this company.
good,"It will be better is they paid fair for the job. Need more associates. Its a fun place to work. Nice co workers. The health insurance is really good. Discounts to movies tickets, cellphones companies."
good,Not the best place to work not very flexible on the work days mangement did not show much care for employees personial life's if your not full time not a good place to work.
good,"Management took a huge turn about a month after I was promoted. They became extra stiff in a not so good way. They would push their employees to such a high expectation that many couldn't reach. They would start to tell us to push the credit cards on people in ways that weren't fair to the customer. I had one manager indirectly tell me to lie to customers just to get more credit cards opened."
good,"I started at a Home Depot out of state. It was a great place to work. I transferred to a store in Florida where the management was terrible. One bad manager ended up firing half the store employees. When the store employees petitioned for being fired unjustly, the company simply 'investigated' and fired all the store managers without hiring any employees back. "
good,"They kept changing my agreed schedule."
good,I mostly enjoyed the customers while working at THD. I learned a lot especially when working the Service  Desk as well as Bookkeeping. Management not fair!
good,While work load and hours were fine the overall atmosphere and morale of the store was very low due to poor management. With disrespect from managers down to subordinates being very common.
good,"typical day was helping customers and meet their expectations"
good,people do not seem like an important piece to home depot.  anyone can do the job and they will replace anyone that doesn't meet metrics that do not apply to each store
good,This job can be fun at times depending on your position within the company. They had some DIY classes in the store on the weekends that everyone would come participate in. You're able to go from dept to dept so you pick up on how to do various things easily!
good,"I worked at the Jacksonville, IL store for 7yrs and it was never that great of a place to work.  The pay raises were 2 cents a year some years others maybe 5 cents.  When I left I never made over $10ph. Management did as they pleased and never followed company policy.  You may work in lumber but be told to cover plumbing, in which you know nothing about, so that makes customers very unhappy."
good,"Working at home depot in Tucson, AZ was a tough job and low paid. Part time shifts during the weekday and weekend. Job duties were to clean the parking lot clean from trash, collect carts and return them to the front of the store. On some days were too hot and humid. Another job duties were to help customer load heavy merchandise onto there vehicle."
good,You get treated poorly if you try and ask them to work around your life schedule for school and other jobs. I personally did not like how I was treated. The managers need respect and an attitude check.
good,"I learned a lot, they provided a lot of training. Most of the employees were easy to get along with. The difficult part was the odd hours I had to work. There was no routine work hours. Every day had different work schedule."
good,"The first years the management  was awesome, my coworkers  very nice , but then they change the manager and she change a lot things a lot people quit because of the lack of oportunities to growing inside the company, the schedules are crazy no much time for family  or friends the pay was extremely  low, and became fulltime  almost  impossible the training was very long ."
good,They go on and on about how you can move up but you can’t. Promotion spots are very rare and when they do open up they go to favorites or they hire from the outside. I’ve given up on moving up and am looking for other work. Also the hours are extremely inconsistent and in the off season they’re non existent.
good,It is a good place to work but thw salary is no good for some line workers like me. It was first time working there. The managera and HR administration have no regards for some employees at times. They are rude and callus.
good,A typical day at home depot consisted of routinely replenishing stock unless it was a day of four hours of training. It was boring but I learnt a lot about supply chain logistics.
good,"I would recommend this job for anyone who is retired and single, with no children to support. Annually review for increase in salary are more often than not to get a favorable review."
good,"Not a bad place to work but , managements is not on their level. They have favorites and never acknowledge associates. The hardest part of the job is the atmosphere."
good,"Was hired temporary/seasonal but told would be kept on several times..I worked overtime and weekends..released after season over..I really enjoyed working there because I knew about the store and liked helping customers. But some of the employees do not work, gossip and try to get others in trouble. Management could be more involved with the workers and stop some of the talking thats hurtful..none was to me but some to others"
good,"We were expected to hit the floor running and everything should be completed by the end of your day."
good,"flexible hours, typically given free meals during holidays and family events, advancement of placement possible with a timely manner, good environment to gain knowledge"
good,"The management was never really informed on what was going on, so I never was really given a permanent placement in the Home Depot that I had worked at. I worked everything from Garden Center to Receiving."
good,Home Depot does not pay enough to live off of or support a family. The managers and coworkers are great people and really care. The customers are wonderful also and are always happy to see a smile on your face.
good,"Fast paced, never a dull moment. A lot of interaction with the customers.  team oriented on all shift.  Mgmt are penny pinchers when it comes to proper raises."
good,Come to work clock in do your job and go home. Work your hours take your lunch break go back to work. Hardest part of the job is working with people that don't care about what they do . The best part is knowing some of the nicest people that want things to go forward
good,My store area manager managed by fear of the loss of your job.  This is the only employer that I walked off the job on due to the fact that he continually threatened to fire me for his mistakes.
good,I was a cashier so I got to see the new appliances that had just came out. The hard part about the job is that you are standing on cement all day which hurts your back a lot
good,At home depot you find good people customers and co workers but it all comes down to management that determines what kind of feel your work place gets
good,"When I went too work for Home Depot in April 2013 it was a bit intimidating, I was a little slow at learning but I picked it up. It could be stressful sometimes but I went with the flow, The management treat me well. The holiday season was stressful. I enjoyed helping customers and my co-workers. It was good company too work for."
good,"The culture at my store was never great. We had over an 80 percent turnover rate for a couple of years. Poor management, poor communication, and the shift scheduling was HORRIBLE. Plus the company has been making shifts with new labor models that force employees to work in departments they aren't familiar with (which makes customers and associates both frustrated), and having less coverage in general."
good,No raise in three year but i got promotion.  Make no sense looking for another job. I work hard but here are no rewards/ nothing more to this not good
good,"Upper Management reduces staff to save cost but OVER WORKS the little staff that is remaining to work! The ""7 minute rule"" pertaining to the time clock will get you fired the quickest, no matter how good of a worker you are."
good,I loved working at home depot up until the last 2 years.  My hours were always above the 25 hour mark.  The associates I work with are like a second family even a few department supervisors.  When the off season comes hours are cut there is very little but up to now I still managed to have over 20 hours a week until now.  The HR is not approachable and there is favoritism.
good,Working was great I learned a lot about my department.  Customer assistance in my area with learned information was enjoyable. Co workers were great and helpful in their areas
good,"Home Depot would be the place to work if you plan on making a career out of it.  I was not happy when I was told I would be getting 27 hours a week, when in reality I rarely have seen more than 22 hours a week on average.  Having a degree I thought I would advance or be paid slightly more than average, but that is not the case with a store of this ."
good,Good place to work for a part-time position. The pay rate is low but you can create your own hours. I you like working with people you'll like Home Depot because you meet new people daily.
good,you become very close with coworkers and customers you work with regularly. The company is constantly changing managers and procedures. if you are not a supervisor of any sort your job is not as stressful. They keep taking away help but dump more work onto individuals which drive people out the door. they want double the work low pay.
good,It was a good place to work with a great bunch of people to work with did not have to run a cash register which is one thing I don't want to do the worst thing is having to climb latter's to the top of the bays and get stock down
good,worked as a cashier and made decent money. flexible work hours. hated standing in front of a register for hours on end. the job was boring and usually uneventful except the occasional shoplifter taking 500$ worth of tools...
good,"The absence of proper management leaves for bad morale. Store management more worried by things that affect them than what affects the employees."
good,A large percentage of the management members only focused on personal relationships with their favorite sales associates as opposed to managing the store.
good,"Was not a bad place to work but I injured my back. Otherwise, if I had not hurt my back, I enjoyed my time at Home Depot. Often we did not have enough associates to get the job done. Many times I was the only one in my department. The workers were diverse. From all over the world."
good,"Not much room to advance, especially as a female. Hours are all over the place and usually mid day, good place to work as a kid in high school or first job. Can mind your own in this environment for the most part, good benefits and bonuses. Management is always changing but did learn a lot of things about basic home skills going forward"
good,"It's an Average Job. Some of the people there makes it an hard job to do with all the drama and SOMETIMES management doesn't help. Advice to you: STAY TO YOURSELF, DON'T MAKE FRIENDS!!!!"
good,"The morale at my first store was awesome. The mgr was retired Naval officer and the culture of HD was strong."
good,"The Home Depot is a great company with American values. I believe they should be harder on associates with lackluster performance. It's a good stepping stone, and if you're so inclined it's a great career opportunity."
good,Worked as tool rental associate for 18 months after completing biotechnology classes and new I'd be eventually moving on.  I eventually started in the biotech field.
good,I left THD because of the new personnel model. My schedule was cut back with no notice. Management at the top matters a lot and my store went from having a go-getter and earning bonuses to getting minimum bonus.
good,"As an OFA my life here has been an interesting one, but to put it bluntly, this job has made me into a completely different person by exposing me to the reality that is working for the public. The management at this facility can be described as ""Questionable"" overall an Alright place to work if you are trying to save up some extra cash to move to a more profitable job."
good,"Work was stressful. Had no support or help from management. Management would be in back not willing to come out for customer disputes or complaints. Company has changed a lot. Used to be all about your family and they would work around your home life. They cared. Not now, not anymore. All about sales. Numbers, statistics, metrics!! Corporate greed. Job was very hard, fast-paced, and had to be able to multi-task. Very demanding as well. Company used to recognize you when you were a hard worker. Not anymore. Barely recognized. Too much politics and favoritism. Most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I built on my own with my contractors."
good,"Corporate does not investigate allegations against employees in a fair and thorough manner. Knew an employee with high integrity that was accused of racial slurs by anonymous call to corporate headquarters. Employee was immediately terminated due to false accusations that could not be verified nor was the employee ever interviewed on their on behalf. Totally unfair and a disgrace to the operation of the company,"
good,"The company has decent benefits but tbh if anything I found myself disliking a lot of the employees. Very biased and judgemental. The customer base itself is as any customer base, it has its good and bad people. Be prepared for weekend rushes where customers will be furious because they cannot get the items/help they need because the associates in their depts can't be found. Or when you need to close 3 aisles to drop a pallet from the overhead rack and dealing with angry customers b/c goodness forbid you are ensuring they do not die. I've learned that while working here you will see the very petty side of people rather quickly."
good,Grande possibilité d'avancement de carrière. De simple manutentionnaire de nuit a préposée a la réception des marchandises de soir.
good,Management spends a lot of time writing lists to give associates but very little time training and/or working on the floor with associates. They are very biased and have obvious favorites.
good,The hiring could be better is understaffed and you cant get the help you need promotions are rare work can get a little stressing sometimes when you don't have what you need in front of you tool etc.
good,"I keep this short. I worked at the Home Depot for 5 years. Loved the co-workers, hated the fluctuating hours and the constant bi-polar nature of management. In other words, they constantly changed your tasks and job description on a weekly, if not daily basis. As long as the company is hitting sales goals and management gets their bonuses they'll leave you alone, otherwise they go on a purge to see who they can get rid of. The customers where not that bad."
good,"When I was hired we had an agreement pertaining to my schedule and hours.  This was to ensure I was able to spend time with my kids when I had them.  When they switched managers, the new manager would not hold up to the original agreement and prevented me from spending time with my family."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers. The management at the current store I work at is unprofessional and they have hard time dealing with all the problems that go on in the store with associates, customers and each other. No communication makes a lot of our jobs very hard to do. I have learned that if you want to have a day to run smoothly you must let those coworkers around you know that they can not be stressed as things will not change the fact that we are overwhelmed. They can then relax and try their best 1 customer at a time."
good,"When working for THD, as a part time associate, my schedule was very hectic. They had me working over 20 hours most weeks and had me doing all shifts, morning, days nights. Anything they could put me in. The main issue is that the management was not that well, when asking for a day off a month in advance they denied it. Then during a high volume time of the year they let a lot of higher ups take time off leaving the store in chaos. They say they have an open door policy but no one felt comfortable confronting this scheduling issue."
good,"ok spot for a young kid to learn a few things about home renovations, also a great second job for someone wanting to learn the same kinds of things..."
good,The home depot has great employees but the management crew is only focused on making their quarterly bonuses and not appreciative of the employees. Sales goals were outrageous
good,"Never in my life have I ever seen a company with so many ups and downs as Home Depot. Some of the greatest management I've ever worked with has been with this company, and also some of the worst. It's a non-stop revolving door of management at the store, district, and corporate levels. Associates get pulled in all directions. Especially when you move up into a management position the responsibilities and pressure from the job doubles, while your pay stays relatively the same. The benefits from this company are outstanding especially the higher you climb the ladder, but there is so much miscommunication here. It never felt like we could get a routine going as there were so many changes in the direction of the company way too often. I did learn the most I've ever learned about management, and it's definitely shaped me into a thicker-skinned and extroverted person."
good,Was told old management has been removed and the culture is a lot better now. I do miss the culture and over all company. Just bad management at the time I was there.
good,"It was a decent job, but management was definitely not top notch.  Schedules were all over the place and make sure everything is in writing, don't assume because you were told somethong was ok, that it is."
good,No room for advancement unless you give into the politics and drama within the stores + managers usually get away with being useless. Managers also love giving away free money to make a customer happy but don't care about associate feelings and how they handle situations when they go against a decision that an associate has already made.
good,"managed a variety of operational areas, including: inventory, customer relations, performance goals and planning, department sales and service levels."
good,"Typical day at work was extremely stressful, had no idea where you were going to work that day. Workplace culture was rough, management didn't do a well job at keeping the workplace a non hostile environment."
good,"Schedules vary, pay is not sufficient and there is no room for advancement.  They like to hire from outside of the company for management.  Little to no training to help you complete your job."
good,"I didn't have the best experience at Home Depot. Management was okay depending on who you were dealing with. During the spring/summer season they will put you in the mulch pit for multiple days in a row.  Anything dealing with garden tools and house tools as far as plants, lawn mowers, etc. I learned about the materials that home depot provides in the store.I also worked around older and younger people who showed me a lot and shared their knowledge."
good,The staff all worked together but you always have some that are just Lazy! If hired make sure in good with the HR department to report any wrong doing
good,The way they promote from within is nice but they don't pay enough for the positions they put their associates in. The work can be very strenuous. Morale was a foreign concept at my store.
good,"In this position, you are expected to help all customers who come into the department (sometimes up to 5 people at a time on average), down-stock the department, and clean the department by yourself. Due to the labor model, the department is only given a specific number of man hours per day to work. That normally makes it to where there is only 2 people in the department the entire day - 1 person from 5am to 1pm; the second person from 1pm to 10pm. You are given no time nor help to complete everything that needs to be done in the department. You either help customers and leave the department a mess, or you clean the department and neglect customers. Either way, you do not make the sales plan created by the company due to the lack of coverage and then you get penalized for it. It kills the morale throughout the store."
good,Cosistantly hiring new people with little or no experience in the departments they are assigned causing conflicts with the customer. Assigned hours are not regular for part time employees.
good,prepare to be overworked in your department. home depot is a huge business that hires many people on a daily basics but yet there was still almost no employees on the floor to help customers. they dont offer that much benefits. its a great job if your doing part time because they are very flexible.
good,Home depot is consistantly busy and stressful for you if you have and laid back kind of attitude. And there are never enough people scheduled to be on the registar.
good,"Anything dealing with garden tools and house tools as far as plants, lawn mowers, etc. I learned about the materials that home depot provides in the store.I also worked around older and younger people who should me a lot of knowledge. the hardest part of the job was working outside in different weather. i enjoyed talking to different people and helping them with anything they needed."
good,"The 'nice' attitude of managers doesnt medicate all the problems i had. i was working 8-9 hours a day in the hot sun, i got heat sickness multiple times and no one did anything."
good,employees would do a lot better if they had a regular hours and the work was varied and not always trained for or backed up by managers.  not enough sales associates to help all people.
good,Low pay and hard work. You'll sweat your butt off and earn every penny you make. Managers are ok.I worked at night so forget about having a life. Work /sleep and on your day off...... definitely sleep!!!
good,"I worked  for Home Depot for three and a half years and during that three and a half years I saw so much favoritism, gossip and drama... it was so thick I had to leave September of last year."
good,I liked talking to different people everyday. and it was nice to be able to help someone find something or make them have a pleasant experience. IT was fun learning new things about hardware
good,The management does not hire intensively greatening the stress and workload to an unfeasible rate. Poor scheduling by management that leads to unsatisfied customers and poor service.
good,"Home Depot is an American home improvement supplies retailing company that sells tools, construction products, and services. The company is headquartered at the Atlanta Store Support Center"
good,The company is a okay company for a person who has financial support outside the company. But I personally need a change and a better opportunity to make enough money to obtain financial stability.
good,"A typical day for me at work is coming in working the folder's such as the refund tab, calling customer's about their refund's. Working the call list, calling customer's to schedule a pick up date for their orders. Asisting customer's with their credit cards payments.Helping customer to apply for a credit card .Answering the phones and taking messages if needed. Canceling orders and calling to get RGA'S for orders which means calling the vendor."
good,Company's consistent scheduling is non existent. during summer months you will only get 12-16 hours a week. Raises are miniscule. Management cares more about  making the sale then taking care of employees.
good,"its pretty much what you would expect from a retail company, the pays not great but depending on how flexible you are with your schedule you can probably manage an average of 25 hour s a week part time. It's not easy getting full time."
good,"Nothing special I can really say about working here, the benefits are good and the schooling is great. Management depends on your store, I have two managers I get along really well with."
good,"As a cashier, you get the least amount of respect among the workers. Though roughly half of the people I worked with were pleasant or better, the other half made it difficult to enjoy my job. Our hours were restricted, we weren't allowed to gain the same benefits as the others in some cases. Overall I wouldn't ever work there again, but it's not a terrible company."
good,"You can not make a living wage, unless you ""bleed orange"" and become upper management. They are restructuring the labor model, and it only seems to make things worse so far. Employee moral was already low. This has made it worse."
good,"It started out as a great job. Once you’re there for a while people pretend to be your boss/supervisor to get you to do their work, the hours got cut to 10 a week and everything moved too slow."
good,"Everything depends on management, when I first started it was great but it become poor. It works if you need a part time job or you're looking for extra money."
good,"Very fast pace but fun"
good,"lots of internal politics,dealing with customers supposedly a proirity and certainly enjoyable, but more empasis on stocking and shelf work  not enough training"
good,"Stock shares are steady and growing. So is the employee turnover."
good,It's a good job to work for but there are too many lazy employees that managers don't pay attention to if you need time off or you need something taken care of from a manager good luck it takes forever and the pay rate is unfair they pay the slackers more then the hard workers
good,"The training is questionable.You more or less have to ttrain yourself.Management does not always communicate thoroughly with associates.Some of the department supervisiors at times don't have enough knowledge to be helpfull.which brings me back to the part about training.The company thinks that merely doing your training on their computers is satisfactory enough.As a result, the associate is poorly trained and will not be helpful to the customer.They will hire most anybody they can right off the street.They just want to make their hiring quotas and have more orange aprons on the sales floor.I spent 12 years with the company and was never really comfortable working there."
good,This is a good place to work to learn about the products of the construction industry. While the compnay stresses customer service it does not staff adequately for that. The company asks alot of its people for low pay. While your responsibility may be sales they actually want order clerks and with heavy inventory responsibilty.
good,"Enjoyed helping customer and variety of tasks. Had to be in garden whether it was freezing or hot as Hades for hours with no relief. Preferential treatment of cashiers, other staff. They received $100 bonuses for doing nothing but stand there instead of helping customers. Manager knew nothing about running the store-didn't like to get his hands dirty. First thing he did was remodel his office. Staff room didn't even have a proper trash can with a lid! No chance for advancement-dusty environment. Workers and customers ripped off Home Depot like crazy, stealing tools, wires, cash and everything else possible. "
good,"Management at the cedar city location did not care about the turnover rate of employees as they would consistently underpay staff and would rather hire inexperienced employees in sales positions than promote from within. "
good,"How the day at Home Depot works depends mostly on management and how they're willing to respect and back you up, Most of the time management went back on instructions they gave you and make you look bad in front of customers."
good,"your coworkers are great, im very productive ,always seem to get a smile or hello  from some of the management, would like todo something else in the company"
good,This company offers a lot if you want to stay in retail. The biggest problem like most retail big stores is you are just a number. You can be replaced in a heart beat. Their upper management has no interest in keeping a good store manager in one store very long.
good,Pay need to be compensated for short staffing and stressful situations. Employees should be help more accountable for their actions. Management can do alot better when it comes to being professional and not holding grudges
good,"A typical work day at the Home Depot can be slow and unproductive at first and slowly increase towards the middle of the day. I've learned a great deal about plumbing and gardening issues that I wasn't aware of before. "
good,"It’s a good job in the retail environment, but I work there while my child is in school so they provide the hours I can work which is good but I cannot move up so it is not as flexible as I would like it to be."
good,"Workplace and management constant pressure on job performance  far exceeds employee staffing, compensation and training. Employees cannot live on the compensation offered which drives continuous employee turnover. Management unwilling to take corrective action to address/fix known problems..."
good,"The Home Depot ids very flexible to needs, but will pressure you into fitting their needs over your own at the same time. THey provide training for growth within the company, but do not always allow for time to utilize this resource."
good,"After awhile of working for the company, I was a bit perturbed by the lack of understanding that not all people come from the same place in life. Seriously, I believe that all people be treated equal in accordance to the law, which has not been upheld thus far in my experiences. However, such passive intolerance may not actually reflect company core values. Although, no such inclusion and appropriateness to acceptance of all individuals per workplace professionalism has been seen to date. To be fair, locations may vary in relation to area. But considering as how I reside within New York City, I was surprised, but not shocked by some people's behavior. Some coworkers were worth the stay, but at some point one must consider their own overall mental-health in the matter. Give it thought before looking into employment opportunities, unless a specialized area of expertise grants unique employment privileges."
good,Learn about products you need to sell. Also need to know how to multitask. Very crowded place full of everything you need to sell for building and repairing your home.
good,"If the home depot you are applying for is in the right area, I feel as though you can thrive and actually enjoy your job. If it is in an area with poor demographics then look forward to a lot of ""angry"" customers trying to get over on the company and managers keep ""the customer is always right"" attitude and granting returns on old paint sprayers and beat up lawn equipment. There is also not a lot of space to grow within the company. If you want to grow, you have to do some major sucking up."
good,"As a designer my job had a lot of responsibilities. A lot of times as a designer you’re often doing multiple things on your own, and I mean completely alone. There’s hardly anyone to help you aside from other designers if there are any working that day, occasionally a passing manager. The designers were very under appreciated for all the work they did. We often had times where mentally we couldn’t progress due to lack of support. It’s not a job I’d recommend."
good,Constantly dealing with the shortcomings of people who do not want to do their job to the best of their ability or to any degree of their ability at all.
good,"Great support, never slow, always learning. Everyday brings something new to the table and as long as you bring an open mind your possibilities for success are endless."
good,"The Home Depot is a difficult place to work as a GM.  They actually encourage turnover, and talent isn't valued as much as the number of years you have on the badge on your apron.  Tough place for a college-educated person to operate within a store--especially when most of your superiors grew up pushing carts in the lot and worked their way up."
good,This is a good place to work if in college or retired. The management only wants results and will work any department head to death to get their yearly bonus.
good,The two different stores that I worked at provided the meal at these two hour meetings. They also used this time to pass out awards to individual employees.
good,Management changes a lot and some of them are idiots that delegate too much and sometime you get the rare smart one. Some days are dreary and boring but they have lots of events to liven up the day.
good,"I did customer service. It was as any customer service desk, with returns, exchanges and purchases. I didn't have too many rude customers. Very few actually. I had so many wonderful customers who were kind and patient. I guess I was fortunate. We would have a couple of training videos we needed to watch just to keep us sharp and updated for our work. We also had accuracy carts to make sure we are looking through everything in a customers cart so we do not miss anything and to make sure we are accurately charging our customers for what they want to purchase. The co-workers were great, management was good and training was spot on. They want to make sure your well trained for your job. I enjoyed working there."
good,"The good and bad days come and go but the feeling of exhaustion is everlasting, There's those great customers who are sweet and make you happy and then there are people who just want something for free and damage merchandise just to get it marked down. Then you have management thats kind of criticizing as the rules change from person to person, some call it favoritism, others call it politics. It depends on who's in your corner whether you get annoyed with rules and issues or not. The environment is great and the co-workers you have will always make you laugh or just enjoy your day and some customers are completely insane but they do lead to great funny stories later on. How much work you do depends on who works before you, sometimes those who come in early dont do anything so whoever closes gets the leftover stuff or if your closer doesnt care whoever opens has a disaster on their hands."
good,"The company puts their profits before the customer and employees  you don't always get a break, they tell you get a bonus but you lucky if the bonus is $50.00 and they offer no discounts for their employees"
good,I often find myself doing things outside of my job description. I am used to doing so but I often get talked to when I don't get everything I am supposed to do along with everything for everyone else done.
good,"Was hired in under good management, then management was restructured.  Restructured management stank, did not care about customers or employees, only the stores bottom line.  Seems to have good managers back in place, even consider going back to work for the company."
good,Each store is run differently. Policies are very gray. Upper management has bad communication skills. This is a company that is seemingly starting to be more concerned about the money the name is making and less on the lives and incomes and families of their managers
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work for temporary status.  A typcial day at work would be greeting customers, assisting them in what they need, working together with associates and meeting people.  There is  sufficient training and education to perform job duties.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to help customers find what they need and help them determine what they need to purchase for it."
good,"Depending on the position the job  can be laid back, but some mangers do  show a lot of favoritism among employees. Freight  is at your own pace, there is a lot of heavy lifting, and you do work hard each day but its defiantly fun working as a team"
good,If you like customer service than this place is for you.  It drives the mission just like most retail stores these days.  Not much room to advance as management gets shuffled from store to store usually.
good,"was a cashier, already knew what to do, management wasn't all that great.  the culture wasn't as customer friendly as i like there was no hard part to job, the customers"
good,Only part time available so there are no benefits. Schedule changes weekly making it hard to make other plans in advance. Immediate supervisors were good to work with.
good,"Very repetitive and often times boring, the pay is decent and the hours are flexible.The management is very lazy and often times takes very long to help you."
good,Every day is a different challenge. Need to stay on your toes and make quick decisions. Your store manager will set the tone for the whole store. Hard to keep hourly employees.
good,"Home Depot is a good place to work as a foot in the door job, or if you are retired and familiar with the trades. I advanced quickly with the company going for part time to full time within 3 months and promoted to department supervisor 3 month after that. There are two problems that I face as a still green supervisor. One is the lack of training offered by the company. They just threw me into the role without any in depth training. Trying to learn the new role on top of a new department in which I had no prior field or product knowledge will burn a person out fast. Second the lack of proper staffing. In the department that I currently work in they schedule a very small crew. (most times I am by my self trying to help customers on top of stocking shelves and maintaining the department.) The department is a very busy one and could use more staff members."
good,"wouldn't work here again, the hours could be all over the place, very political, and it may have just been my location but it was not the best work environment"
good,"It was ok no room to grow in security field. No set schedules, a lot of policy changes. Normally only support you have is no more parent if you lucky."
good,"This company, while providing good training and pretty good pay, wants workers to push credit like crazy, even threatening write-ups if you do not get credits. Doesn't want to hear about shortfalls and gets defensive when anything isn't blindly accepted, especially when it comes to staffing. Department Supervisors are run ragged."
good,I loved working there it had its ups and downs like all jobs but i like that finding something to do was simple just ask someone in a department if they needed help.
good,"Really depends on the store manager, i worked at a store in WA that was wonderful and one in OR that was the exact opposite. works well with those who need flexibilty"
good,It is a job you will always be busy at. They tell you there is always something to do. If you don't have anything to do find someone and ask them what you can help them with.
good,"Benefits, and stock are a plus with The Home Depot.  If you can work your way into salaried management the pay is much better.  Work/life balance is horrible."
good,"My time at Home Depot taught me many things, In the beginning the focus was customer service, We were trained to always find a solution to help the customer. As the years went on the company changed its mission statement. Our well known customer service became a mere former image of it self."
good,"each day was pretty much the same, organized the store all the way around, stocking products, helping costumers find products. ive learn to be more organized, to categorized items by departments. management wasnt on top of employees needs."
good,"the managers are not that cool, and often pick favorites. The job is pretty simple, its just a grind.  The managers would often have me do things that were not in my job description, which was annoying because it was usually physical labor that they didnt want to do themselves."
good,The Home Depot is a good place to work as long as you are flexible to their hours they schedule you for work and the days they schedule you. If you work part time they will work with you more on your schedule then if full time.
good,"Depending on the position you start at, advancement opportunities can be slim. Management at the store level is more concerned with what the corporate offices think than their employees."
good,its a long day of standing on your feet you get good and bad costumers. good working enviroment and accentives. hours are duable need better pay ok benefits
good,"Benefits were good, but the lack of of communication and structure is what brought me to decide to leave this company. Most of the staff are amazing to work with."
good,"It's very busy in the spring/summer months. If you don't have the patience to deal with lines out the door then this job isn't for you. I learned if you great a customer with a smile (typically), they'll be more patient with you and your help. Being computer savy does help, as does not taking things personal. Management is iffy sometimes, but you'll find that anywhere."
good,sad job but good people. management needs to be retrained to be able to work with the employees and the customers.  I feel very strongly that management has forgotten there place and what needs to be done.
good,Depends on the type of management who covered for the day of the schedule each week. Will explain in detail if asked. From the time I started about four years ago until currently I would say the ways things are done things need to be changed in order to be more successful.
good,".  The only good is the benefits, par time people get benefits. You have to be available to work until 11;00 pm including weekends.Part timers have different hours every week. I only recommend this places to work if you are going to school."
good,"Not a bad place, But better wages would help the company in keeping good people. I have worked for both Lowe’s and Home Depot, the biggest difference between the two were wages. As far as how the employees were treated, not many differences."
good,"Management are bully's."
good,"Light hearted friendly environment. A place the young or retired to get a check. Lots of benefits and incentives. you get rewarded for every good thing you do. You can definitely move up with the company, quickly if you have the drive."
good,It is a convenient job for students or people that just need additional funds. It is not likely that you can survive off the income if it is your only job.
good,The hardest part of my job is having to tell customers we dont have a certain item in stock. i love to help people so when i cant do that its the worst feeling.
good,it was a well managed store with opportunities to move up but the pay didn't match what i was doing. i was getting paid the same as people with less experience.
good,Great Associates and a lot of knowledge . In the 12 years that I was with the company I got to network with the vendors and learn from them . Worked for some good managers and some managers that were better at following and not leading.
good,Nice place to work at if you like moving boxes and placing product on the shelf on the freight team or merchandising team they just underpay you and in some cases you may be understaffed which means more work.
good,Good company with a clear emphasis on customer service. Empowers employees to do what it takes to satisfy each customer. Has a goal of being the top retail company.
good,"A typical work day would be very stressful due to balancing hours with other associates. Most times it would be stressful and drastic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, positive environment. I learned a lot of work skills from working at this company considering it was my first job."
good,"Fast paced, stressful and competitive home improvement warehouse.. High volume of purchases for home  construction.  Seasonal impact on company which makes sales decrease."
good,"Lead various teams of 3-15 people, resets seasonally, receiving merchandise, stocking  departments. Writing and delivering developmental reviews, disciplinary  notes. Cash and vault verifications, Manager on Duty responsibilities, opening & closing the store."
good,"have to be retired or a yourn addult living at home with parents to make ends meet at THD.  Management or supervisors can make a living, but lots of hours and red tape to accomplish advancement"
good,"Working at the Home Depot and learned a lot about teamwork, about customer service skills, patience how to multitask and also that the customer is always right."
good,"understaffed retail store, pressure is placed on employees to pick up slack when others don't complete their job, management will not call in workers when others call out sick placing excess load on workers, excess responsibility does not earn additional pay, no effective means to suggest improvements or correct bad processes, politics and favoritism  are rampant,"
good,"No comment at all since I currently work here and this isn't the time for me to make this sort of evaluation. One thing I will say is that if you suck up enough to the right DS, you can go far"
good,"Waisted 10 years of my life with a company that was never about taking care of there associates ,why I stayed u ask ? Is because I have a family that needs to be taken care of ,poor management and lousy pay .I wouldn't recommend anybody work there ,unless u want to make a quick buck and not a career"
good,"The Home Depot can be an interesting place to work.  It is based off of the immediate leadership you have.  You have to keep a great attitude and do the right thing even in spite of what type of management you have.  One manager can ruin the  morale in the store.  I was always my best when dealing with my associates and customers.  That is the basis of our business and it will reflect all the way to the stockholders.  That is also the most enjoyable part of the job.  You get to make an angry customer happy or an unhappy associate smile and turn theirs days around.  You get to make a happy customer/associate happier.  I learned quite a lot as a manager at The Home Depot, especially dealing with people.  That was one of biggest strengths coming into this position and I only got better."
good,"$10 an hour, not really any room for advancement, management was indecisive.  It would have made a difference if they offer employee discount........."
good,"My day would start out by opening the lumber department by dropping bunks of lumber, what ever was low, So the contractors had good building supply's to choose From."
good,Home Depot at one time was totally invested in it's people and truly cared with so much growth & advancement over the years they have strayed away from that & it's no longer a people oriented company.
good,"I was hired on as a regular associate in the call center and moved up with in 2 month to Team Lead. They had quick move for advancement."
good,"some people had it very easy if your friends with the right people, others were run into the ground until they quit. district and regional management made it impossible to run a store properly. District human resources routinely would twist the arms of store management, and wreck employees, they violated their own policies, many times colluding with district managers, then turned their backs on management in stores, leaving them to take the heat for what was done."
good,Some of the management were awesome but the overall store manager was terrible and really did not seem to want to help college students work there.  Most of coworkers were great.
good,"Company always involved in fun events with community, morning meetings and employee events. Only issue was with management, and the lack career advancement."
good,"Helping customers in every area of the store. Fill stock in bays. Load trucks with fork lift , pull appliances down with order picker or reach truck. Help people with where orders if they have any problems. Keep customers happy , solve problems in all department. check signs and change if price has changed. Did not pay well.  Had some great people to work with."
good,"Good summer job that worked with my hours and overall relaxed about when I frequently went on LOA because of school."
good,"I worked for home depot at a bad time with a very bad ceo but today the company has changed and went bad to being the company they started out as, they still need more people on the floor workers"
good,"overall ok place to work, pay could be better but with good management team it balances out, i would recommend this company to anyone seeking employment"
good,"I had a great experience working with some awesome people who are passionate about their job. There are lots of tenured associates with 25 plus years experience."
good,"Average at best customer service job, not all days were your best day as often customers were rude and demanding however many days you found yourself helping with a project that would positively effect the community."
good,"Home depot work enviroment was nice, difficult to froq and salary very low . The work place is safe. Unfortunately  theres more preferebces towards friends and family. It was really hard to find someone to help woth reach truck or when i needed to cut a big carpert..  in weekends  it was overwhelming wheb  it was about trying to make sales and taking care kf customers on site"
good,Nothing special about the home depot. Show up to work. Work hard and get paid. You will only ever hear about the boxes you forgot. Annual raises average around 30 cents with a few exceptions.
good,"A somewhat relaxed work environment, but not a smoothly functioning organization.  Many of Home Depot's problems originate at the corporate level.  "
good,"Not too many chances to advance in the company. Lots of favoritism, so that is the best way to move up. They pay too little for all the work they expect from their associates. When there is an upset customer, for the most part they won’t stand by their associates in fear that the upset customer will contact corporate, even if the customer is wrong."
good,"great place to work if you do not pursue management. i enjoyed working in hardware and multiple other departments, unfortunately when you get promoted they care more about doing paperwork than they do customer service"
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers, I feel they do not have very qualified people working in some departments and they did not seam to care either. I think it is important to serve to public"
good,"This job has many of the mainstream retail expectations. Stocking outs, front facing departments, and applying security devices to high dollar merchandise. Assistant managers; however, do not follow through on department walks at this location and there are no associate discounts offered at any home depot location."
good,The first couple of years were great. New management came in and everything changed. Didn't care about the employees only about the numbers. Loved the employees that were there.
good,"Work in lumber, moving heavy loads, and very fast paced when building contractors are there.Then deal with DIY and hobbiest making suggestions and precise cuts. But get paid the same as the janitor. No incentive to do a good job or handle difficult customers."
good,The company is having trouble deciding what type of place its going to be. At my store we have had a almost 300% change over in salaried managers in the last 2 years. We have some great people working there but a lot of people that would have issues keeping a job in fast food
good,For the most part it was a great place to work from what I remember.  If they wouldn't have changed their salary plan I would consider going back to work there.
good,The company overall is okay. There is not enough room for advancement. When they hire in house your resume is not considered they just pull random people from the floor and ask if they'd like to fill a position.
good,"HD as a company is great! They offer great benefits and pay with tons of extras. At store level the culture is changing for the worst! The stores in Lubbock TX are taking the orange blooded associates and replacing them with young ""attractive"" butt kissers. Say goodbye to the orange blood that represents customer service and loyalty. Now it's about...are you young✓ do you not have your own opinion✓ will you do everything I say whether it's the right thing or not✓Will you refer to me as a boss not a leader✓ Your Promoted!!"
good,Home Depot is very poor at developing a good work life balance.  Manager for first 5 years was good.  The manager based out of MSP was very poor at communication and expectations.
good,Home depot was a good place to work great environment. I would recommend employment to anyone that wanted to work for this company they great benefits and competitive pay.
good,Management is very poor. The company itself is very good. Advancement is very poor. A lot of favoritism with managers. Very bad Ops ASM. Very stressful and management on your back at all times.
good,It wasn't too bad but the managers are way too strict..as if you take too many step or whatever the case may be they yell at you .The open door policy is bs.
good,"I mainly stayed indoors and was often asked about items such as grills, outdoor furniture, power equipment, and lawn mowers. I would also go outside and help people pick plants and how to maintain a lawn. I was often in charge of the cleaning aisle so I became proficient at helping customers who were looking for a specific product."
good,"As a part time associate, I am scheduled 90% evenings.  As an evening associate, you feel as if you are the night maid.  When you arrive, you began to clean up what was left from the earlier shifts, such as baskets of freight, baskets of broken down displays, and stray freight from the shelves left in baskets."
good,"loved the job. but i kept on geting right ups for going to class on saterday.so i made up my mind one day and just decided to go back to school. so it is a good job, loved it but school was more emportent than a job that would not help me."
good,worked there for about a year and a half. got fired because I used too many points. Was told by every supervisor to come back in 6 months. waited 6 months and reapplied. They responded that I cant reapply for another 7 years.. makes no sense.
good,"Fast paced environment but depending on which warehouse you work in, you find people in each department willing to work with you. Also they say that it's equal advancement but it really comes down to if your friends with the hiring managers or not."
good,"Seems like a great company to work for...IF you end up with an okay supervisor or a decent amount of hours. Hours are randomly subject to being cut even when you've been there for far greater a time than other associates. You could end up with less hours than those who were hired after you even if your more reliable and do what your supposed to do and go above and beyond. Favoritism isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Many people get to do things NO ONE should be allowed to do and many don't get to do what they should be able to do. I've been told many times SOP for getting full-time is that you be there as a part-timer for AT LEAST 6 months.Well there are some who get a full-time position within weeks when they should automatically be disqualified and others have applied who have been with Home Depot for years. The pay is nice and the raises are more than you would get in many other places in my personal experience, but it's counteracted by low hours and lack of any real benefits as a part-timer. Micro-management can be a seriously frustrating issue as well. Full-time is basically out the door and there's not much room for advancement. As far as I can tell this is simply because they hire people who already work in 1 dept in a FT position into another recently vacant spot. Too many people apply internally and externally for 1 position for you not to get looked over. I've tried numerous times to get a FT position and it's just not happening. 1 reason for this could be that Home Depot looooves to switch management and supervisors to different stores in a region or district every"
good,"I felt like I was just a number and an employee. Too many rules and regulations. Little flexibity. Were watched constantly, and they were very obvious about."
good,"Wasnt a good job, they would pick favorites. If you enjoy overtime ,then they'll give you a lot honestly this store works you to your last bone,so bring a pillow with you you'll be tired"
good,"Go to work and do phone sales, will-calls,online orders, installs,leads,measures,deliveries,cashier, and customer  service. Learned how to put on a good example to make others want to follow and always look forward at the good besides the negative. Best part is getting close to the associates and also daily customers."
good,It really is a good place to start and learn some essential people skills. The time I was there as long as you do your job you will be just fine. I worked for the corporate side of home depot but still had lots of customer interactions. Home Depot MET is a great start.
good,This Job did not pay well for the job description. You never just work in one department although you are only trained in one department. When and if promoted the raised is not worth the new job load. If you you need something in between jobs then I would suggest home depot.
good,This job was low paying.  The duties that they expected from you did not reflect your hourly rate.  No employee discounts and some of the employees refuse to help you with a customer
good,if you re someone who is with the in crowd or favorable amongst higher leaders it will be easier and less pressure to work.  As a manager it was very high paced and could be stressful if not supported with the right resources.
good,"Management plays favorites. Customers are terrible and rude. Expect to be yelled at by strangers daily for no reason other than that they want free things. Scheduling is terrible. Never enough coverage in departments. Can't ever find help when needed. Simply put, don't do it."
good,"the management at my store is abysmal. The store manager runs the store with an iron fist and has the assistant managers do all of his bidding. whenever he's on the floor doing something it's only to let people know what they are doing wrong or to be imposing on everyone's work. my typical day is different because i work deliveries which means I'm constantly on the move and my pace is never fast enough for management. They think you have all the time in the world to get things done. "
good,a typical workday consisted of helping customers find certain items around the store and check out their items. the hardest part of my job was the fact the there was never enough coverage in the store to work effectively.
good,"Too much stress and anxiety for the hourly rate. There is a thorough"
good,Shifts that are available will not give you work/home life balance. Associates on the shift will not have an opportunity to work on the day shift until at least 5 years on the night shift.
good,It's a good place to work if you can get in full time.  The work environment is fast paced and very customer service oriented.  The training is all on computer and at times very boring.
good,BIM was a know it all. Wouldn't listen to any ideas.  Everything was always someone else's fault other than his.  Previous manager was great. Most the team he had quit once the new BIM started.
good,"Call on customers for specialty products was a Typical day"
good,"The Home Depot lifestyle can vary from store to store with each management style influencing the atmosphere.  At the Fairfax, VA Home Depot, the management needed much improvement and a better way to reward those that work harder than others.  Customers can be unforgiving but with the right knowledge and attitude, they can become loyal customers.  It is unfortunate that some customers expect employees hired from the street to know everything about all 400,000 + products in the store and that is hardly ever the case.  As most businesses are, maximizing profit while cutting costs is a prime directive in most businesses.  They exploit their hard working employees and threaten to replace you if you don't meet their expectations of you, which can change from person to person.  As a former employee, I constantly strove to better myself and take on more roles in the store to help out the team and the store as a whole.  Unfortunately this is not recognized when you cap out at what you can personally do and they expect more from you.  They do try to pull the best from you, unfortunately this job will pull everything from you.  This company provides great benefits and is a great place to start employment, but it is hardly a place to establish a healthy career."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. Is management that makes it hard, it all depends on who you know to be able to move up in this company, corporate don’t care how you are treated as long as there numbers are good they don’t care about there employees. They are never able to keep workers for a long time at Home Depot."
good,"It was a mixed experience here. Good and bad bosses can make or break the job. Friendly coworkers help too. If you come with a positive attitude and the people are friendly, this might be the job for you."
good,"Use forklifts to help stock products into rafters in a quick and efficient manner, Stock the shelves with products you pulled off the pallets,Stock the garden area using the forklifts as well"
good,"worked overnight stock, hours were ok but refused to work with you if you need to changed them, never had enough people to work, they give you food once in a while for hard work"
good,"My experience revealed a poor management system. One person doesn't necessarily know what the other is doing. Lack of respect for the managerial ladder. Training was not overseen. I ended up not getting the appropriate computer classes at the time I needed them."
good,"It really all depends on which  one your at! The store manage at my store is easily referred to as ""the Warden"" because of how she runs it....noone likes her and she continues to cut everyones hours."
good,"The job wasn't organized, They had a poor management and they didnt respect some of their employees. I worked there for almost a year but I could take it anymore there. I left that job for a better paid job."
good,"Management provides little to no product or sales training. The management requires the 100% commissioned sales associates to train new hires and generate leads without paying any compensation. As a sales professional; paid on 100% commission on jobs sold outside of the stores, it is unacceptable to be required to do work in the stores with no compensation."
good,Associates friendly customers are taking care of in timely maner. upper management are not worried about associates until they are not getting them profit to the store.. Pay is negotiable and the more experience the better. If paid hourly and not management it is a pretty stress free place once you move up the stress can get to you. If you have a family it's hard to spend time with them b/c of hours of work
good,A typical work day at Home Depot started early and ended late. While working at HD I learned that working from home is not so great because you constantly feel obligated to be working. Management is okay but at times can seem cut-throat.
good,Company not sensitive to employee needs. Do not have a feeling of Job security. Very little in the way of advancement. Poor benefit package for part time help.
good,They wanted me to move and drive in 8 hr it was a 18 hr drive. i got off at 9 pm and they want me at work at 6 am the next morning. So when i didn't make it in time they fired me
good,"it is strongly based on a buddy system, regardless of your work ethic or your attitude towards things you can do whatever you wish to do if the managers like you. Some of the hardest workers tend to get the most BS so if you plan on moving up be prepared to tend to egos and put on a fake smile."
good,management is extremely difficult to work with and plenty of health hazards. overnight is for people who desire only work. only positive thing is the people you work with.
good,I worked for Home Depot for fourteen years seven as part time employee and seven as a Supervisor. I ran three different department in three years and shipping and receiving for the last four years. Home Depot consistently rotates upper management and at time places people in positions they are not capable of running. When your boss doesn't understand the aspects of the job and tells you how to run your department it does not work.
good,Home Depot was a great experience for me. I learned many new skills related to various types of projects and home improvements on the job. I tested my physicality and ability to learn and adapt by working in almost every department in the store over the course of my employment with the company. The staff was generally very supportive and positive in every location I worked in. There were opportunities for advancement and a fairly solid company culture and agenda.
good,The management is to dependent on the lower staff and asks the lower staff to do all the dirty work while the upper staff just sits there and looks good
good,Ok place to work at they are very busy and you will always have something to do. Management is not the best but they are constantly rotating the managers
good,"the worst is the pay compensation very low and they expect a lot out of their employees "
good,"For the amount of work you do its not enough pay. Mileage that they pay you doesn't cover your gas for the week, No overtime if you have overtime they will fix it or you will have to cut it on your lunch break by taking longer lunches"
good,I got this job as a second job overnight to help out with some bills. The work is pure manual labor but simple enough. The issues I had mostly came from poor management that showed favoritism to particular employees and also corporate ruled down a mandatory schedule change for my whole department with only two and a half weeks notice that put almost everyone out of a job.
good,"Need to dedicate more time to training program.  Need more systems to recognize good employees that want to work full time."
good,"Pay not bad, benefits O.K., hours awful.  Hard to balance work and family - especially having school aged children.  Opportunity for growth, if you proved it."
good,The company was a great place to work before the founders left. The leadership that followed them changed some things they should not have. I had planned to make it my last career and watched as the replacement leadership systematically went about changing the company culture not always for the better. I understand the current leadership team is much better. but have no first hand knowledge as I am no longer with the Home Depot.
good,good place for a sheep to work meaning that if your open minded or free spirited than you will likely get put on the black list everything has to be done BY THE BOOK or else....
good,Understanding the materials and tools is hard sometimes. The customers have great questions and always needing help from a different co-worker to gain the information.
good,The job is hard and great pay. You learn about each department that around your own department. Free opportunities to be creative. Always willing to please customers and to help them in any way. The cons is that the store will have more then one assistant managers that never really agree with one another.
good,you are just a number to them. the only way you move up is to suck up to mangers or be able to sell credit cards. the mangers put unfair stress on you.
good,I am working for Home Depot while in school. It has been a fantastic job but with new management my schedule continues to conflict with school. Some policies have been changed in ways I do not agree with.
good,It is a fun fast paced place to work.  Really enjoy the associates and vendor partners.  It is a full time 11-15 hours a day job that truly doesn't have a work life balance.  If you love working and not seeing your family this is the job for you.  Dont trust your HR partners at any level they arent there to help you.
good,"Most of the employees at the HOE depot are great people, however, the Management at this particular store was poor. Lack of communication between the ASM and each other was an issue. I enjoyed the people and learning about home  improvement but the morale was low due to the Store Manager."
good,"homedepot over all is not such a bad company, but there really isn't much place to better yourself. Also management happens to be a big issue with this company."
good,"Pay raises are rigged to be denied"
good,"The management was poor. He never knew what was going on and seemed to care less. They worked us like dogs. I had to load lumber, sheetrock, plywood etc as he let the lot guys sit around all shift. "
good,Training could be more hands on. Short staffed most of the time. Management does not know what the associates have to deal with. Benefits offered are good but price is increasing.
good,"Unfortunately, advancement opportunities seemed to be limited.  Even after being persistent in asking about transitioning to another position, I felt like I was left in my then current position to satisfy store/management needs only.  Hourly employees start out part time only. I never got a raise even after getting good reviews. Going full time was difficult and I never knew when I would be eligible to change status. I think overall THD is generally a good company but my biggest complaint is how to advance within the company.  I think THD loses a lot of good employees.  Then again, it is the retail industry."
good,"Home Depot is a fast-paced environment, great opportunity for knowledge growth about construction business and networking with a variety of businesses"
good,"The company routinely talks paying in accordance with ""industry standard"" but clearly that is at the bottom end of the ""standard."" If you work here, make sure you negotiate coming in the door and avoid HR areas, as they are the ones that will low-ball you financially. Company is also GREAT at promoting from within, but does a poor job at developing leaders. Decent benefits, good networking opportunities, relationship building opportunities and good overall ""taking care of our people"" culture.......outside of HR."
good,Management is ungrateful to those who put in extra work. They never see their mistakes and its their way or the highway. Very understaffed and always have a huge workload. One manager likes to sit in his office on saturday and sunday all day watching football.
good,"There is a lot of favoritism that goes on and when you are on a LOA they take a very long time to give you money, but that's if they approve of you not being able to work."
good,I learned a great deal about paint when I worked in the paint department. With a good team and a cool department supervisor the paint department can be a lot of fun. I also learned a lot about flooring and wall tile in the flooring department.
good,Job satisfaction working at the Home Depot is really hit or miss depending on your store. Your managers and department heads truly affect the mood and the environment of thw atorw hwhec
good,A consistent flow of customers. A good environment to learn diy projects and home improvements. Both men and women can learn everyday household improvements with their knowledgeable associates.
good,"I worked in the garden department, and i'm minorly prissy, so long story short i hated it. The only thing that was good was that you could call out often"
good,"Employees are overworked for minimum wage.  Lack of communication between management. One manager tells you to do one thing, another tells you to do something else. You'll get written up for choosing one manager over the other pretty much. The most enjoyable part about the job is your fellow coworkers getting you through the day. Also, some of the customers will treat you like a slave and think they're highly above you."
good,Upper management only cares about the numbers NOT the people. . can be very cut throat. they love to get rid of tenured people.good old boy mentality.
good,It was a decent starting job for 19 year old me but other than that I don't have to much to say about it. hours are very inconsistent and you have to work weekends so take it or leave it
good,Work there an liked it was fun till I got a new ASM an then we did not see eye to eye so I was let go an I am a hard work an work very well with others an I became a survivor 30 days after I started there..
good,Unless you are upper or lower management you wont get the hours plus some of the management leads are lazy and love to tell people what to do but not pull their weight.
good,Have been with the company for 3+ years as a General Warehouse Associate. Its a great place to work if you are in school because they are fairly flexible with you. VERY repetitive and physically demanding work.
good,"great co workers to work with,pretty good benefits and pretty easy work but where it fails is management. "
good,"ok work environment - good fellow co workers, management some were good some were none existant  The stock plan seems good with 401k and health plan if you work full time."
good,you would work schedule hours. you wouldn't get more than 23 hours a week unless you got called in to cover someone who called out. If you are a student they will work around your schedule
good,Working here had way to much serious booty kissing and favortism if you were not among the CLICK then you got hammered on for stupid stuff no matter how long you had been there.
good,I had fun working at The Home Depot. I'm looking forward to working there again. I worked hard there myself and it was rewarding. It is a family oriented place. I wish that I still work there. I like the renovations that were done while I worked there. It was a good interesting experience that I wish it didn't end as soon as it did.
good,"Its a decent place to work, works with your schedule, rather for school, home life, etc. Well it was like that when I was their. I'm not sure how it is now since I left and my General Manager left."
good,Great place to shop but tough to work for due to days off are speratic no set schedule. If management doesn't support you they find ways of forcing you out.
good,This is not somewhere you want to make a career. You can definitely make more money working somewhere else that has a less stressful environment. I would not recommend.
good,The atmosphere was good to work in but the management seemed to have favorites and if you werent part of their favorites then you stayed on peoples watch
good,"Most customers want to get in, find what they need and leave as soon as possible, those customers often ask for the location of the thing that they are looking for and it can get hectic at times. You have to learn fast and know where things are.  A line of communication between the department heads and the other associates is almost non existent, especially for newcomers. Allot of times the department head will not tell you if your doing something wrong and may even relocate you to a different department or fire you. You need to know your stuff if you want to work here because their is little time to learn."
good,Hard to please several customers in a row or at the same time.Long days on the floor.Lots of trash on the floor and parking lot.keep the shelves straight and organization of meteral.
good,"The scheduling is a mess you may close at 10:00pm then have to be there at 5:45am the next morning. The team on the floor is under staffed so you are continually trying to find some one for the department. Some team member are carrying three different department phones. "
good,"Trabajo realmente fácil de realizar y un ambiente laboral comodo,el personal es agradable y enfocada a su área de trabajo"
good,"Overnights at the Home Depot can be a stressful job. At my location, we have trouble keeping a full staff, which requires more output from those that work at nights."
good,"Worked there for 23 years!  Great company to work for and eventually retire with, but its a lot of hours and very competitive.  The culture is vey infectious, it can be a fun place to work."
good,"They love to use 1 employee for a million things in the store. Work in different departments, help multiple cust. All at once! They overwork people and want you to keep getting credit cards."
good,"You would get a variety of customers, but if you enjoy working with people than time would fly by. I met many great people coming in for paint advice. I had many customers who were impressed by my customer service skills since they did not get that interaction with many of the other employees. Some of the other employees would gossip, which I'm sure you'd find in many workplaces, but sometimes it would get out of hand."
good,"I have worked as a garden sales associate for 6 months now. I received consistent hours through the beginning of the summer, but now they are tapering off. I spend most of my day stocking, as there aren't too many customers. It gets boring quickly. There is a big gap between associates and managers. I have talked to my store manager maybe twice in the time I have been. I rarely talk to managers. I never receive encouragement or anything. It's an okay at best place to work."
good,A job with adequate pay and responsibilities. The management has high turnover and sometimes the job is stressful and physically demanding. It is mundane and repetitive.
good,"As much as the management isn't very good, let alone helpful, the employees are fairly productive and always busy with something. Typical work days are very busy, always something going on."
good,"Its a job.  You can make money and support yourself, but its not a lot and when your a temp. your hours can be cut severely with little warning.  Its very fast pass, busy, and exhausting."
good,"Originally when I applied and got hired I was expecting to work my scheduled shift, work as part of a Team, pull my weight as others too.  Yet, that wasn't the case.  I be told the same day a few hours before my start time I would have to go in for OT without prior notification.  As I work the overnight shift those that leave 11pm & 1am normally don't clear their tasks and its doubled unto the midnight shift.  This pattern made it a more stressful situation and animosity towards the 11pm & 1am crew.  Yet when you think about it its more the Managements fault as they allow this and other behavior to occur.  Their is also too much micromanagement yet those that are on numerous unapproved smoking breaks throughout the night aren't even addressed due to their years at the company and who they know."
good,"Worked for a number of years for company. Team Depot projects in the community are amazing & very fulfilling. Somewhat good culture, better management that most. Higher positions are often eliminated but have other associates move into the responsibilities of the job that was eliminated."
good,"I was working part time and would put upwards of 18,000 steps in an 8 hour day on the store floor. It's a burn-em-churm-em environment. In the year I was there, I got one compliment from a manager. One. Wow, talk about feeling like you just don't matter."
good,N/A   Questions on working for THD were answered above. The quality of products is very good.  Transitioning from part time to full time could be quicker for the new employees.
good,"Pro:  My fellow workers and my supervisor are good to work with. "
good,"Hired to work in one area but expected to cover any other department at any time. Hourly pay never changed but hours fluctuate without notice (20 one week, 30 the next). Only benefits are the ones you pay for yourself.  Don't expect any holidays off. Store managers are good people to work with and most of the hourly are good people too. Big store so get good walking shoes."
good,"The actual day to day work at home depot is actually not bad, its easy and you can even learn a thing two, however there was at least in my experience working here alot of negatives from very poor management (hr especially), lazy entitled coworkers, unchecked racism and sexism, zero preperation and protocol for unreasonable customers ( customer spits in your face there is NOTHING you can do about it and if you were to call the police in that situation you could be fired)"
good,I enjoyed working there but was forced out at the end because my position was deleted and they could hire new for less.  Open door policy was a joke. Best to keep to yourself and not trust anyone lots of clicks.
good,"Management was not very friendly, and they could definitely improve with training new employees. Other than that, the schedule was very convenient. I liked it."
good,Ok company I like the experience gained and the sales that I generate for the company. It has taught me alot about flooring and and the different aspects of the home depot.
good,"My position was to greet incoming customers and help them locate what they needed,and possibly guide them on how to go about using the item, and also maintaining cleanliness throughout the store"
good,"great place  to work. "
good,Must be able to assist customers with what's needed. It's what you make it. The company has great benefits for full-time employees and some good ones for part-timers as well. Must be willing to learn and be a team player.
good,"This place likes to make you feel like they care, but in the end, its just a call center with bright colors. The so called upside down triangle is a lie and nobody takes ownership of the lopsided disconnect between leadership and the peons."
good,"Great atmosphere, a lot of good people working here. Pay was better than minimum wage and benefits were ok. It's a great place for someone who's looking for a job there first time."
good,"It's all about who you are to succeed at this Workplace.  Home Depot was at one time a very fun working environment.   However, Management Changes and Department Associates have horrible communication.   Turn Over is Huge."
good,"Though Home Depot is one of the best paying entry level jobs in the area, they seem to have a lack in strong management and leadership. With the size of the store, the employees should be adequately dispersed and coverage should not be a problem from shift to shift. Many times there is not enough employees to cover mandatory breaks. However, there are some days where there are too many employees on the floor for that particular day. Lack of communication and understanding is the biggest problem in this location."
good,"Generally a decent place to work, but the recent changes passed down from the corporate level regarding compensation and benefits have hampered the workplace.  A good place to start, not a place to stay."
good,"a typical day at  work quick"
good,Now that they are under new management things may have changed a bit. The atmosphere was cut throat competitive. Favoritism was out of control. I enjoyed working with the public. I enjoyed helping the customers and making them happy. I loved being able to train the new cashiers. Over all unless you are in the beloved circle the atmosphere was repressive and demeaning. It was a man's world at the depot. The idea was to keep the women up front in the kitchen so to speak and the ones that got out typically didn't get there through hard work. The store was absolutely scandalous while management wore blindfolds. Even so on the upper levels of management.
good,ayudar al cliente y cuidar al asociado revisión de mercancías por embarques y recibo
good,"Started at cashier. Some customers are great, others not so great. Moved to Flooring and enjoyed it much more. Always something to do if there are no customers to help. Worked several shifts in the department alone when there was not much coverage."
good,"While in this particular store, the standards and lines of business are not very organize. Most coworkers and areas are good. Good to earn money while looking for something better."
good,Home depot is the perfect job for someone just looking to make some extra money or a college or high student looking for part-time work its a temporary job for those looking for a career unless you are willing to sacrifice your time your family and your life itself I would not make a career in retail
good,The ammount of work that they have you do is a lot and the money that they pay you is very low. They would have you work your whole department by yourself from 5am till early afternoon and then get upset when the customer service dropped.
good,theres many pros and cons to this employer. pros- they have decent hard working people working with you. cons- management is abismal. they dont give you enough sources to get your job done and they still expect it to be done. communication is awful.
good,Travail peu stimulant mais parfaite pour un étudiant! L'équipe de travail ainsi que l'ambiance était la meilleur chose de ce travail. Faciliter d'évoluer dans l'entreprise si vous le désirez.
good,"Homedepot is an ok place to start at an entry level position. Minimum wage level pay, raises are not that great. Homedepot does offer a wealth of trainining and knowledge to their employees on the various products and departments within the store, so that's good. The culture is the best part of homedepot they really try to stay positive and optimistic and motivate their employees."
good,Liked the work and some of the people.  Management was a little lite.  Unprofessionalism in some of the management.  Would have liked to have off every other weekend.  Management gave you a hard time about taking lunch and breaks.
good,"Home Depot can be a fun workplace. You're constantly interacting with customers with questions and concerns.You have to put customers first. There is a lot customer accounts that you, as an employee have to handle"
good,"The one i worked at was alright, work wasn't too bad. Team leads did get annoying and too antsy sometimes. Pushing carts isn't that hard, it just sucks when you're solo doing it."
good,"Working here has its up and downs but over all its frustrating,  your not appreciated,  ur disrespected by mangers,  and they don't care about your where snouts of the job,  they lie about your hire job and give u another job to do.."
good,Great job to start off as a high school student or to start building your resume. The pay is about accurate for day time work but for night time the pay is well below par because of the workload and the physical demand.
good,Working as a freight associate at The Home Depot definitely kept me busy. However I feel that they pay way too little for all the work you do. Management was very disorganized and always on your back. If you did a good job they rarely acknowledged it yet were quick to give you warnings if you accidentally messed up on something . Overall the job showed me how to open up to customers but ultimately stressed me out do to poor management.
good,"While the wages and working conditions are substandard, this particular store is able to recruit some exceptional employees.  Unfortunately, the demands of the job, lack of growing opportunities and wage structure make it difficult to retain good people.  This is a sad state of affairs because heavy turn-over is a major expense for the company and provides less than the best knowledgeable and competent staff to serve their community and customers."
good,"To start at this job, is great. For somebody trying to have a career, it is not ideal. There was no room for advancement, there wasn't even room for a full time position."
good,"always busy constently asked to do extra work not my own"
good,I enjoyed my work in the Garden Center.  I liked my fellow employees. The management at the store level was unprofessional and disorganized.  Overall it's not a bad place to work.
good,I liked working at the Home Depot. The Home Depot was a great working experience for but it didn't fit well with my daily life. The training was easy and my coworkers were very helpful and welcoming my first official day
good,Very stressful environment management sucks and the play favourites. Not a very good overall rating but they do have good benefits package and bonus at end of year
good,"My mother said if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. Working for the Home Depot isn't like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It's retail... just like any retail job."
good,Worked 9 hours at night. Had to make sure freight was put away then on top of that had to maintain bays and cleanup after the day crew. Hardest part of the job was trying to make sure everything got done.
good,Great people. Not a lot of hours available for most part-time positions. Pay is not great and the benefits for part-time aren't great. Seems to be high expectations for the rate of pay and with the number of staff working at a given time.
good,Just like any job- Just too much nonsense go o there and the company refuse to make accessible to promote within.  There is a lot of nepotism and the bonus is lousy -  Again just a lousy paycheck
good,"I love working with the people there, but some days can get real stressful, especially during peak season. some customers can be very nice to you and some can be very mean."
good,"I worked at the contact center for 4.5 years and always felt like a fish out of water.  The environment is better suited for high school graduates or recent college graduates with no work experience."
good,"Not the ideal environment, but not horrible.  Nothing really stands out to me as a glowing positive, but I wasn't treated badly. Maybe just wasn't a good fit for me."
good,Decent place to work for.  Hours vary per week and holidays are expected to work.  Sometimes you can get a lot of hours and others you can get 8.  Management varies per store but most seem to be ok.
good,AT home depot being a cashier you clock in and wear your apron; the workers are expected to be on time or they will get points. I feel like its ridiculous that you cant call off when you are sick
good,"I would enter the establishment on time, set up my register, initiated bringing over customers off other lines to decrease the amount of people and provided the best customer service. I also helped clean up the aisles and the front end."
good,"The day to day activities are mostly enjoyable, but settling customer complaints is draining. While there is rom for advancement, if you are you are not friendly with management and/or you have a change in management with different leadership styles, it makes it harder to excel."
good,"working at the home depot was a very rewarding career and made me feel accomplished."
good,"The Home Depot company takes very good care of its workers, the problem is that they have a hard time hiring and keeping any decent Upper Management. Store Managers are usually rude and do not try to keep a pleasant and respectful work environment."
good,good job but no room for advancement 2 managers there are really just not nice at all but other then that its a good place to work they have a monthly lunch party thing witch is nice also it is really clean and super safe
good,"I have enjoyed and appreciate my time at the Home Depot however, there has got to be a better job out there for me.  I love working with the other associates in the store and everyone is really helpful and accomodating.  The management is cut throat and at times snobs in the fact they have no care but there bonus's and not to the associates that actually help the customers.  frustrating at times but also rewarding if you get a decent customer that shows up.  You find out real quick how alot of people in the world feel entitled to whatever they want and that the rules will not apply to them.  So like above at times fun and good times, and the rest is frustrating to the point where to convinve yourself this is just not for me."
good,My direct coworkers were the only reason I stayed for so long. The management team plays favorites and do not care for their associates on a personal level. Lot attendants were getting hired making more than I was after I had been working there for 2 years.
good,Great place to work family environment can advance word gets slow sometimes but is  real good coworkers are not so great but the CEOs awesome  I really enjoyed to work there  would definitely recommend it to someone
good,"this was my first job and it had taught me a lot l, I had a lot of learning experiences with this jobs a lot of rough times and a lot of good time but I want anew experience"
good,"It's a very easy job, you have to work in teams to get the merchandise out. The manager buys lunch from time to time. Management shows plenty of favoritism regarding dress code. The shifts are short"
good,"We are required to consistently do more  with less.  Eventually this type of system will implode. Assistant managers take the brunt of this punishment, while store managers/regional/divisional managers reap the benefits."
good,"a bit understaffed for the customer volume and can be chaotic. Strong management focus on associates value, but not always carried out. good opportunities to advance."
good,Great place to work to learn new skills.  I would recommend it as an entry level job.  I believe being a part of the management team definitely was rewarding.
good,Home Depot overall is a good place to work. The only downfall is the compensation and the hours. They do not pay very well and there is very little room for advancement.
good,My job was to help people chose and find what they needed for their projects.It was fun and enjoyable. I was laid off before becoming  a permanent employee
good,"They promote customer service first, but there are never enough personnel on the clock to make this happen. The pay scale needs to be adjusted to make it competitive. You have some employees make $30.00 / hour who have been there awhile. Then you have people starting out @ $10.00 / hour with a slow course of merit increases."
good,"The management is very bad. They do not know how to manage the associ, they would rather tell there employees what to do with a harsh attitude​. They also need to stop having favoritism they have for certain employees."
good,"Could not work the flex schedule and never had two days off in a row."
good,Not every manager is on the same page and often times you will be given jobs by two different managers that contradict each other. I wish there was more consistency.
good,"I did not learn the products well enough to give great info back to customers "
good,"se manifiestan muchos conflictos de intereses, ya que no se siguen los valores que profesan,"
good,"While there are some wonderful employees and members of upper management, I have struggled to have basic conversations with my immediate supervisor and his manager. There is a lack of communication, complete failure to properly train new employees (computer training without interaction) and a lack of ownership and vision to rectify existing issues. Lower management is responsible for the attrition I have seen over the past year."
good,While working at the Home Depot i've noticed that its a diversed atmosphere which I like but it can be stressful when you don't receive enough hours. The pay is great but sometimes the mangers are uptight.
good,Home depot is great for part time. It's super flexible but if you're trying to build a career its difficult to advance. Pay isn't that great for the amount of work you are required to do. It's a hit or miss with managers. I've had experience with great managers who are willing to be out on the floor and be proactive but i've also had managers who don't do anything. It's discouraging to work in an environment that doesn't give you the support that you need when you need it.
good,Great employees but management does not have structure and were careless . The company does not pay you fairly. I was doing twice the work and i was part being giving full time hour with no benefits.
good,"A typical day was usually non stop working with customers, vendors and associates."
good,"In my experience at the Home Depot I have learned quite a bit, from using lift equipment to just about any product in the store. It's a unique blend of warehouse and convenience store. That being said, it has a few issues with the following: Scheduling, executing new ideas, and properly training associates. The scheduling issues make it difficult to keep people in the departments, and even harder to perform our daily tasks without borrowing people from other areas and leaving departments empty. This leads me into the new ideas comment. Every time they want to impliment something new, there is rarely anyone around to do it. We are left short staffed constantly, usually all remaining being new employees that don't know how to cover their areas properly. Lastly the training. Home Depot has a bad habbit of throwing newcomers onto the sales floor before they've finished their training. More often than not, they're put in without any training at all. All of this makes it a struggle to help all our customers and keep the store in the shape it needs to be in."
good,Great for part time work. does not provide living wage even with tenure. The work is easy to learn but does not provide adequate challenges to further growth.
good,"When I first started working for this company it was great, our DM was a jerk but our store always made and exceeded sales plan for they year so it didn't matter. Then they changed our DM and Store managers and assistant store managers and everything went south. The priority use to always be customers, with the new management it wasn't. I resigned and took a lower paying job so I didn't have to deal with the management anymore."
good,"Moving up in the company is very difficult at less you are willing to move to remote location. Regional management team is more concerned with putting together their ""own"" team and filtering out the current team."
good,"Most employees are wither 50+ and on their second career or are very young; management is focused on daily/weekly/monthly quotas and little else. All that said, there is very little micromanagement, even as advancement is very slow."
good,"Home Depot is an ok place to work, it would be great for the first time worker who knows a little bit about tools and hardware. The pay is terrible  9.00 to start had to take it to provide for kids. Management was shady."
good,"On my feet all day.  Up and down ladders, don't know where anything is.  Supervisor hard to find for support.  Learning on my own.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing what I was doing.  I had no idea how to work with the tools or being able to find the right screw to fit the part.  The leadership no so good."
good,On a given day at work i help customers complete their purchases giving them a great customer service experience. Downstock shelves daily and order inventory.  As a supervisor I drive overall performance of associates and customer service.
good,"Home Depot is a structured and secured company to work for, except the tool rental department. I was hired due to my past experience working on small motors and farming equipment. the rentals we offer were in great condition and all was smooth until we began fixing personal equipment for customers. the repair orders ranged from small handheld drills to 3/4 horsepower tillers and the parts were almost impossible to acquire due to the companies rollout of there inventory system. Overall I would of been happy at this location if the process was implemented properly."
good,Company is what you make of it.  If you work hard you can feel good about your day from within.  Very little praise from above and benefit package not the greatest either
good,"Home Depot used to be a great place to work. But these days if your not a favorite then your out of luck. I'm the most knowledgeable associate in the department, and their making me work 2:30-11pm every shift. So basically I spend 8 hours cleaning up after everyone that knows nothing about paint."
good,"Working as a measure technician is a lot of driving. You only get paid per measure, so if you live in a very rural area, you may only get to do a few measures a day. But plan on doing 250-300 miles per day. "
good,"Retail environment is great. If you like customer service, this is the right company for you. The clinics are amazing for learning."
good,They have took full time positions so that they don't have to give benefits to employees. Most employees take years to ever getting full time positions. Always understaffed in all departments.
good,"Paid and hours low, managers don't allow you work more then 28hours a week even they don't have nobody to cover the shift,  manager ask your to cover different department even you are no have training in that department, in a few occasions I have to work by my self y the customer service desk for hours in Saturday's really busy day, they always promising to find 40 hours, raise after a year was .25 cent. Love the job, but management is the store is really bad."
good,"Great Benefit, Need more woman drivers and need more woman in management. other than, that the company fits whoever is able to join the crew."
good,"The company as a whole is structured very solid, however management and fair treatment of associates is less than desired.  The benefits are good, but the ability to advance is very limited."
good,They are LGBT friendly. They weren't very accommodating to my life schedule like medical appointments. The shifts varied. You can get cross trained if you like.
good,"not something anyone can make a career out of these days, wages are just too low and hard to move up the ladder unless you knw people, or you will be stuck at base level positions,banking on your little $0.25 cents raise every year, good job, horrible career"
good,"Worked at the Kings Canyon and Chestnut.  Employees there will talk smack and try to fight you.  Work given is ridiculous and management is horrible.  If you have friends who work with you, that will be the only why you like working there.  Other than that everything else was horrible.  Pay was not good for the amount of work doing and amount of BS you have to get from customers and department head and other employees. Hard work will never be notice from managers or department heads."
good,Typical day can be busy/slow depending on time of year. Training in beginning is thorough but as time goes by it is dependent on management approval. Management may/may not be supportive depending on their discretion. Hardest part of job is getting coworker cooperation/ easiest part of job is customer relations.
good,"Within IT, the managers/leaders are not good, most were promoted into the role and do not have people skills.  "
good,I learned many new skills - home improvement skills that have stayed with me. This allowed me to better assist customers and also  allowed me to utilize those skills in making my own hoome improvements. The management varies from store to store.
good,"Did a physically demanding job (freight) with little appreciation. Manangneg talked poorly about employees to other employees. "
good,"A typical day is standing at your register, mostly by yourself for the entire shift. You help customers by telling them the location of what certain item they are looking for, and you call the correct department if the customer wants someone to help them in detail. You get a 15 minute break every 2 hours, and a lunch in the middle of your shift. The work environment is very friendly and joyful."
good,as a seasonal employee treated very unfairly compared to the full time associate. managers did not really care about employees and that makes this place not the best place to work at
good,"dislike working there customers were rude , you always catch people stealing even the old contractors that have been buying for years they see a new cashier and they try to make you look stupid plus there rude while there at it . if your available to work any time they will put you to close every day and push to work over time if you dis agree your hours get cut really bad over all I didn't like working there."
good,"load and unload trucks and rail cars,re stack inventory. work with management to see that loads met customer demand.promote a safe work enverioment for customer and workers."
good,"Great for young college and students and retired people looking for part time work.  I do love talking and helping customers with looking for products,"
good,"Don't be late !!! They have a point system for attendance, no exceptions."
good,Similar environment to competitors and like minded businesses. Opportunities available as long as effort is put forth. Atypical customer base diluted by oversaturation of market.
good,"Typical day at work involved standing long periods of time on concrete floor, management tended to hire very immature young employees who didn't want to work and had negative attitudes, and were rude to customers and co workers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with insubordinate co workers who liked to goof off and not pull their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and product knowledge. The company was always having contest and competitions among employees which did not help with low moral issues."
good,"Good ethics and training, corporate has great people who build their stores. No perks to promotions, yearly pay increases are cents,  no employee discounts. You will learn a lot about home improvement, customer service, corporate retail and politics that come with it."
good,"I enjoyed the money aspect of this job. I ended making $13/hr. by the time I quit. Theteam leads were great, management kind of rude. But always willing to give a few chances."
good,"Working with customers do identify solutions to home problems, Cutting wood and lumber for exact fits and helping contractors load material and cleaning as well as forklift loading, customer service"
good,"Responsible for ensuring that customer phone calls and transactions are handled quickly and accurately. Special Services interact with customers and associates over the phone and/ or in the store, to ensure that excellent customer service is achieved. Answering customer calls to the store, responding to general questions, finding customers the proper associates to assist as needed, setting expectations, facilitating will call pick-ups, and resolving any issues that arise. Responsible for providing a safe working and shopping environment by following all safety policies and standards."
good,"Great Job to work, Friendly associates and management, Friendly atmosphere with their customers, respect for Military, Current & Former, Healthy work environment"
good,"I met a lot of people and worked well with others, but the management was horrible. The store manager had people that he knew to be hired and those people didn't do any work."
good,"I have learned a lot of new things. A good variety of people, most good to work with. Almost always get my breaks and more breaks than the other job. Nice to not have to buy a uniform. I enjoy working with the customers."
good,What can I say about the orange life..... it was a fun place to work with a lot of great people.  They would try to work with you as much as they could when it came to schedule requests and hours.  Winter was always hard and lots of people never got hours.
good,The people are very cheerful and good to work with however everyone is very tense when it comes to management. There is way too much corporate drama at times.
good,Home Depot is a billion dollar company but the pay increases are very minimal and hard work does not always pay off. Each store needs to be judged individually because some stores have wonderful management and associates and some stores lack moral. I was very fortunate to work with some great people and that is what I miss the most about working at The Home Depot.
good,"I worked as a temp employee and never intended on staying anyway.  Stocking shelves was not what I wanted to do for a career,  It was an OK in-between job."
good,"Has a Quality control issue, management is not as engaging to maintain and implement a standard in the work place. Most of the staff never real receive proper training."
good,Have did years of hardware jobs and Home Depot did a good job of the things that they had and sold. Management did not take care of employees or help them when needed. The hardest part of my job was helping other employees when needed because management did not like us to help each other.
good,"Depending upon the area you are in, you may experience favoritism and lack of opportunity.  The work itself is not difficult, but you must go through multiple resources for to request the training that you need."
good,"Fun job. The majority of your time working in overnight stocking for garden only requires you to be exposed to customers up to an hour a day. You must be able to know what your doing and get the job done without little or no supervision. Positon for the able-bodied, so get ready to get your hands dirty and have some sore muscles."
good,"Individual teams were cohesive, but not over all site.  "
good,"Supervisors are very lenient they work around your schedule and you can give your hours away they always buy us pizza,the department people help out cashiers and cashier help out lot asso.I loved working there everyone does it perfect"
good,"You have to run the department, do all the work of a regular associate, all of your own work, plus whatever extra work that the Assistant Store Managers and/or Store Managers ""Delegate"" to you!"
good,"A typical day would be working the register and assisting customers, learned more about customer service, management wasn't really the best trying to communicate with. I got along with my co-workers nice people, hardest part was dealing with communication with peers, helping customers and learning about hardware and different things"
good,I didn't work long at Home Depot. I was never put in the right department to succeed. I was first put into Tool Rental and that only lasted 3 days then I was put into Paint Department after I asked for Seasonal Department. It only lasted just over 2 and a half months.
good,"Was quite happy with this company during my time there. However, there was a recent shift from putting people first and coaching employees to be successful to setting unrealistic goals and focusing only on production numbers. Disappointing to watch"
good,You get really good pay however you only get like 25 hours a week management is pretty good from the time i was there though it seems like it would take forever to get full time
good,"Working the nighttime shift, so they hired anyone they could. This meant people who physically or mentally shouldn't have been working were. As a college student, I had to make many friendships with people more than twice my age, many resented me for being younger."
good,the home depot is a good place to work if you are fresh out of high school in my opinion. You can learn a lot about household needs and things u will face as an adult. If u are young expect to be ran ragged. Advancing at home depot can be very hard unless you are bi lingual. The hardest part about working at home depot is keeping a good perception the managers only listen to the department heads so if your not good with all the department heads it can make things difficult.
good,"Good place to work, good atmosphere and people. Good management, fun place and good customer pace.. pay is good,  pretty dead during winter and booming in the summer.. good summer job for kids"
good,"a handful of nice coworkers however the pay isnt all that great especially with 9years of retail experience. Bad scheduling, seldom weekends off and really just bad morale."
good,Laid back easy environment. But a lot of favortism in regards to advancement. Positions are changed with know communication as to how or why prior to it happening.
good,I worked there for almost two years loved the job and the work i did but when they change the management things went down hill .
good,"Your typical workday will be filled with the day-to-day tasks that all large organizations require employees to perform. That aside, customers can be a delight (especially when they have an unique project (e.g., rocket launch pad for model rockets) or out of the ordinary (e.g., 150 year old home with special needs) and they have never worked on a house project before. Then there are those customers, for whatever reason, believe that all homes are ""standard"" and why do we not stock their parts. You are both a""parts-person"" and ""educator/counselor"" when it comes to assisting customers. It takes an agile mind to determine what the customer is really seeking and give them what they need. "
good,"Typical day at work in the lumber consists of a lot of tasks that require tiring physical labor. I mostly learned about different types of lumber, cement and other home improvement necessities."
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers get the products they while at the same time, complete the tasks that management tells you to do. Some days are pretty easy because it doesn't get super busy and other days it's non stop with customers so you can't get anything done. The best part of the job is definitely my co-workers. They are awesome people who want to help if you need it. Most of them do anyway. The hardest part of the job is dealing with needy customers who don't want to do anything themselves. They will make you do their shopping and get very upset if you don't know everything about all the stuff in the store. Most of the customers aren't like that though. But overall it's a decent place to work that pays more than most places around and they help students with tuition if it's a certain degree, like business."
good,"Good job as a stepping stone to other positions."
good,"Home Depot is an alright place to work, however the pay does not match the work effort that you have to put in and there is very little room to grow and advance to a better position. For my job I am required to constantly walk around the building and keep my eye on customers. I apprehend those who have been caught stealing. I learned how important it is to pay close attention to details. I thoroughly enjoy apprehending those caught stealing because I would like to be in the criminal justice field."
good,"On the whole the company was pretty good to work for but the management in place at my location was shady at best and at times, they were unethical. I enjoyed most facets of the job, but given the poorly utilized resources, unstable work conditions and unclear expectations, it became clear to both parties that I would be better suited elsewhere."
good,"Good people to work with at Home Depot."
good,"Home Depot is a good company to work for all together, but the hours they give to part time employee's isn't enough. They care about their employee's but just don't have the hour's to give away."
good,"I can honestly say that, for the most part, I truly enjoyed my job at Home Depot.  I was trained well and encouraged to become even better at what i was doing.  I worked in 5 different departments, and was comfortable in all of them. "
good,I loved home depot it was a great job to meet people to get into a different line of work I got to meet a lot of my friends there
good,"Working in the Lumber Department is rough at Home Depot. A lot is asked of you for such little pay. Back breaking lifting and dirty environment get old, and being constantly understaffed makes it all that much worse. It's good if you need specific hours for school or what not, but other than that stay away from here. Depressing atmosphere."
good,"I have worked numerous jobs with customer service at the core. This company, and I hope it was just my location, was one of the worst when considering employee to employer relations."
good,"It is a high paced call room center. You are there from 6am till closing at 11pm if you choose to. The calls are from different customers about their cell phone service, either satisfied or not. You have to have thick skin to be able to work in this environment."
good,"I ""wore many hats"" there, being that I filled in for other employees when they were cutting hours, eliminating positions or if people quit without notice or were transferred to another store. You get nominal recognition for work well done & possibly a minute raise for meeting or exceeding expectations but if you exceed expectations a 2nd time or more may not be compensated accordingly. my co-workers were amazing. We worked congruently as a real team. Hardest part of the job was the understaffing and having to do your job in addition to that of others who left or were fired without much notice. I enjoyed working with the public, enjoyed the praise I received for being knowledgeable & helpful in several departments. My multi-lingual skills/communication ability came in handy with non-English speakers of several continents. They appreciated my patience and ability to discover what they wanted or needed. Languages are one of my personal interests. I made it a purpose to teach myself useful terms & phrases."
good,as a company its a great place to work but on a store level management lakes the knowledge and the people skills to be efficient in performing job duties. There is to much favoritism for some with management looking the other way and then repremending others for minute imperfections. the company has lost a lot of good employees as a result of the actions taken and performed by certain assistant managers that think they are above or untouchable by corporate policies. makes for a very negative and unpleasant place to work. The company used to be a good place to work There needs to be more corporate involvement in governing and reprimanding managers that issue all the laws that they feel is right at a store level for some and not for others. Those certain assistant managers that feel they are above corporate law in their job performance need to be weeded through just as they have done to associates that work under them.
good,"Love the people."
good,"Very nice enviorment to work lots of changes, training program is a plus, Management could use some help, my opionion though."
good,Pay was reasonable and you don't have to work in food.  The management structure was lacking.  People was promoted based on personal relationships and not experience or work ethic.  Schedule is awful.  No structure what so ever.  You work night or day.  I often closed one night and didn't leave until midnight or later and the opened at 6 a.m. the next day.  Would not schedule days off together either.
good,"The hardest part in working at The Home Depot, there's not much opportunity for advancement in some positions.  There is no available training for other positions of interest."
good,"At least that was my experience. A bunch of petty back stabbing high school drama, managers were no help. People tried to get me fired or tried to make me quit by making my life difficult, even managers. I did my job. I did it well. Its a bunch of petty stuff. Pay is okay, better than any other job I've gotten. Work is EASY if you can put up with everyone being out to get you. If you're a nice person this job isnt for you you will get eaten alive. They want me back, and idk if I will take it or not, they treated me badly."
good,Day to day workflow is not too bad but has a high turn over. a lot of work to do on a daily basis without enough support i.e equipment and staffing. Great to interact with customers and ensure excellent customer service great benefits.
good,"I would open the registers on the opening shift, and distribute all the cash out."
good,There is really nothing to say. I don't agree with their tactics as far as how they proceed in handling certain situations. Some of the the things created within their policy needs to be changed because it just simply does not make sense.
good,"It can be hard work, depending on what department you're in, but it changes every day, pretty dynamic and fast moving."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ringing out customers, showing them where a certain product is. Management was decent and my co-workers helped out a lot when needed."
good,"A typical day at home depot was more stressful than it needed to be. There was a constant battle of changing roles of projects while the project was being executed, as well as lack of clear instruction, proper training, and professional attitude. "
good,"Worked overnight as an order picker. Thank the stars I did not have to deal with the customers on day shift. They are relentless and treat you like you work at Walmart."
good,"Depending on location and department, the work can be fast paced and physically demanding.  If you enjoy learning new things, the training is excellent, and the opportunity for moving to different departments is good.  Advancement opportunities are average.  The management seemed to be restricted by a very rigid corporate structure that was profit focused - very little room for creativity or input for improving operations.  The attitude toward employees was pretty much that they are a commodity and easily replaced.  But the starting pay was decent compared to similar jobs."
good,"Good team effort among the associates although it is poorly managed. The assistant managers tell you what to do and expect it done without considering what else lies ahead of you. After finishing the task, another supervisor or assistant manager will tell you they want it differently resulting in a very little efficient working environment.  The employees are either good or bad to work with. You very seldom deal with a bad customer, but when you do it isn't fun."
good,My working experience at Home Depot was good at the beginning. It was an ok place to work but it has the Good Ol Boy type of mindset going on. But overall it was a decent experience.
good,Micro-Management to many Bosses. part - time no benefits for part time people. Weekends were always scheduled. I liked the work just wasn't managed very well.
good,"Fast paced, easy to communicate with people, and constant work flow. The day goes by fast and there is always something to do."
good,"General customer service including supervising associates, maintain in stock level, and ensuring general store appearance. Supervising store associates including interviewing, hiring, teaching, coaching and training. Providing associates semi-annual reviews as well as additional associate disciplinary actions when necessary. Operational management including front end truncations, special services as well as back end operations. Business acumen to drive sales and profitability. Implementing plans to drive sales based on trend analysis."
good,"A typical day at work was controlled chaos, ran every department at the absolute bare minimum for being the highest volume store in our region, no room for advancement, they didnt seem to like to promote employees, rather it seemed that they preferred to hire new employees at part time because they could pay less and still require the same amount of work."
good,"The company asks lots of you.  It can be fun, but usually management is on you about something.  Always have 3 to 4 people pointing you in a different direction.  Pay is horrible but benefits are good.  If you are salary/supervisor and expect to have a life outside of work, good luck.  Worst work/life balance company of any I have every worked for."
good,Job is very customer service oriented. You have to deal with unhappy customers and come up with solutions to make sure they walk away satisfied. My biggest issued I had with Home Depot was the management. They like to micro manage and make you feel unwanted. I really enjoyed the people I worked with that were at the same level of employment as I was. They also worked with my school schedule very well while I was getting my degree.
good,Hard to move to other departments or obtain full time unless the managers like you. Flexible work schedule. Able to cross train in different departments.
good,"really enjoyed engaging customers and interacting to help in kitchen and bathroom design consultations. I wanted to work full time, but the opportunity never surfaced even though I positioned myself through certifications and relocation"
good,"High stress environment, poor management, high turnover employee rate, poor scheduling. Other departments dump their work on the lumber and building materials associates because they don't want to be trained in operating a forklift or reach making some of their duties impossible. My favorite part of the job is getting to help customers with their needs and seeing them leave legitimately happy and satisfied, knowing they have the right tools/materials for their project."
good,"A typical day at work would entail greeting customers providing customer service working with customers to satisfy their needs . I enjoyed spending my work day with most of my co-workers , the hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy customers , which would then upset them. The most enjoyable part of the day would be spending time with my  service desk co-workers  and inter-acting with the customers ."
good,fast paced and never a chance to be bored.  Horrible work life balance working anywhere from 4 am until midnight or later.  Overnight shifts with little or no notice and 4 hours between schedule 11 hour shifts.
good,There is no directive - they say one thing but only in words no action. They talk about customer service but it is direct opposite.
good,I enjoyed working for the Home Depot because I was able build my on my experience and used that experience to get a better job.
good,"Very busy always on your toes. I learned about many store items, how to check what is in-stock and how to locate them through out the store on the electronic hand held that is giving to you for work use (when there was one available). The Management was alright depending on the department. There were not enough Co-workers from my experience. The hardest part of the job was not having enough necessary tools to go around at needed times. The most enjoyable part was providing good customer service, and having them exit the store satisfied willing to return for future purchases."
good,"typical work day always busy something to do all the time"
good,Management does not give equal opportunity to their employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the public. The co-workers were easy to get along with and most of the time very friendly to one another.
good,"Working at Home Depot there was little advancement, unless you simply greased the wheels with your managers. Plus there are at least five different people who give you five different tasks to complete, and some of those tasks may contradict another task you are required to complete."
good,the group that I work for were amazing group. The department was outsource to a different county. This was very heartbreaking because they advised us that we would not lose our jobs. But that is business.
good,"No two days are ever the same, you have a lot of tasks and duties; hard to be bored working here. You are always busy. Great co-workers, you meet the nicest people in a Home Depot!"
good,"I got to work and pulled out the hose, turned on the water, and went from table to table watering the plants. I enjoyed working with the other employees as they were cheerful and would always take a minute to tell me where to take a customer inside the store if I was asked a customer question and did not know where to go. The heat was sometimes bad, and I would have to take frequent breaks to stay hydrated. The most enjoyable part was taking customers to the area they were looking for and helping them discover which plants they liked best for their purpose."
good,Very high turnovers in sales and service and company headed towards more of a supply company and less of hands on service. Great products for the patients and awesome benefits but not employee friendly.
good,"its ok place to work but trying to advance in this place or the location i was at is hard and there is a real ""high school"" feeling in this place, all the clicks and everything else is here. so as far as management is good just need to improve on how things are as advancement."
good,this is an ok place to work for everyone is very friendly but most will stab you in the back for their own personal gain management doesnt know jack from shinola they are very safety oriented but go way over board on the safety the choice of music is something left to be desired nothing but light in the loafers boy bands and god awful chicks that someone lied to them and told them they could sing
good,this is a great job to learn alot. if you are inclined to go the extra mile you can learn alot about pplumbing electrical gardening reciving and even driving a forklift. but the opppertuities for advancement are few and far between and they like to dangle them in front of your face.
good,"Home Depot really conciders family. If ever one needs a day off in regards to a familt emergency or a hoiday, they feel that family comes first."
good,"Poor training and organization, lots of prejudice and favoritism, some people would not show up for work for days and there were no consequences(later discovered they were in jail). Other employees had to compensate and perform his duties."
good,"Overall it was ok but I did not like management there. Never really like workers getting much overtime, and did not appreciate good work."
good,decent pay if you are young and dont have a college degree. the management doesnt know what they are doing most of the time. not really structured and a well developed place. very unprofessional.
good,"PROS:"
good,They have a great computer based learning system. Co-workers are willing to help most of the time. It is hit and miss on management on following policy.
good,"Working at The Home Depot was an experience I will treasure for the rest of my life. A typical day started depending on what hour you arrived at work, for starting shifts you would have to check and clean the paint machines and then do safety equipment checks, you would then also restock the shelves throughout the day. I learned quite a bit about paints and what works best for each project, also how to mix and apply paints properly for the best outcome. Management was alright, but it was difficult to find a supervisor when needed and they sometimes cared less about any issues you where having. The hardest part of the job was the hours, they management wasn't very flexible if you needed to switch a shift and the hours where very hectic with not stability."
good,"there is favoritism, boss is bipolar, I work over night, having to travel to different stores every day, to many miles on car don't get enough compensation, will wear out your car."
good,"Typical retail job, typical retail hours, typical problems when it comes to going full time or trying to advance. Most coworkers are decent enough people."
good,"I loved my job as Supervisor in Millwork at this store."
good,"I worked for Home Depot in San Diego, the bosses were constantly pushing sales, when a prospective customer came to look we were to get phone numbers and then call them to push the sales."
good,"Very good company. It was a mom and pop store, but they had a good clientele, or so I thought. I think it was a ""grab the bank bag"" and went to the Bahamas."
good,I got along really well with all of my coworkers. There was little drama and it seemed that we all meshed pretty well. I was a customer service rep and we were poorly trained. We hardly had the answers to any question because the rules were never straight forward. Always loads of confusion. Always had to involve management which was even worse because they would bend the rules to fit whatever mood they were in at that moment.
good,assist guest with all there  needs find products and assist guest with putting items in to they car if things are to heavy or tie things to top of  they car
good,"The best part of the job is usually your co-workers and the customers, who are surprisingly nice and courteous. You will get the casual sour customer from time to time. I was a Tool Tech at the Rental so when there was broken machines my day consisted of diagnosing, researching and repairing them, very satisfying and calm. The pay did not compensate for what I did though. The Store manager, is no more than a public figure as he has no real authority over anything and is just there to be....there. The assistant managers do actual work and actually know what goes on and are the ones who can actually help you. Everyone up just looks at numbers on a graph and gives no craps about you, period. I did learn a good bit from other techs and we were usually the most knowledgeable, most professional employees there. Not only did we know all of Tool Rental Dept, we also knew all of Hardware Dept, Garden dept and usually plumbing dept, when many employees from their own dept had no idea on many items/products. Unfortunately they're pretty much looked over by everyone else, except when something needs fixing, then everyone will call you. I do recommend working there, but for not more than a year as the work gets tedious and you'll get tired of everyone stepping all over you."
good,"A normal place to work which always has something for associates to stay busy. what you learn is how to finish tasks in a timely manner and be responsible for your own work. management is mediocre, some knowledgeable but majority is not. The co-workers are like a big family mostly a love hate relationship, some you love some you hate. The hardest part of the job is time management. knowing that you're either working in the aisle, helping customers, or driving machinery its difficult to find an opportunity to stop working. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a pay check. Even with going through the daily ups and downs of work being able to pay your bills at the end of your 80 hours makes going to work worth it."
good,We had good teamwork. We always got our job done. It was nice to know exactly what i had to do each night I came in. The hardware department was my most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"HD is an enormous retail home improvement giant with a lot to offer and a lot to learn on any level. There is an ever changing atmosphere in HD with its leadership to it's processes, so keeping up is essential and being on the forefront of the staffing and retail industry helps."
good,Staying outside all day in terrible weather conditions pushing carts and loading trucks with 80 lbs bags of concrete and mulch.
good,"Didnt provide any training and no opportunity to advance. Coworkers were nice, management wasn't bad but not very organized."
good,"This last review in April was full of outstanding's, yet new goals are always set.  Last years goal was surpassed by over 1 million dollars in sales and this years growth was set to continue that growth.  Before I left, mid year the team was on track for a $7,000,000 year"
good,"Good company to work for, no full time employment.  Medical coverage fair.   I learned how to communicate with all kinds of people and the hardest part of the job was when no one was available to load heavy items and I or a co-worker casher had to do it.  Items could weigh up to  pounds."
good,"poor management, young, immature and inexperienced. great company to work for if your boss is competent of the job needing to be completed."
good,"Short staffed, well supplied merchandise, lack of communication , no real take charge management ...Great benefits, 401 K Plan, short and long term medical leave, stock options, discounts ..."
good,"Home depot was very hard and it was it required late nights of hard work but the hard work paid off. Also it required unusual hours, sometime night shifts and other day regular hours."
good,With the change of supervisors came the change in how associates talents were utilized.  Practices of senior associates were disregarded despite successful applications and required to change practices to new ones.
good,"A typical work day at Home depot would be checking customers out, daily interactions with customers, being able to answer questions, point them in the right direction. I have learned Home depot strive to attract motivate and retain a high-preforming, diverse workforce and it is the eighth largest employer of the companies listed on the S&P 500. Management at Home depot is down to earth, understanding, and very sympathetic. My co-workers are amazing and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is being stuck at the register and not able to go out and mingle with customers as co-workers are able to do working on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting and being a great help to the customers as they approach the front end of the warehouse. You meet a lot of new people just being a cashier."
good,"Some good some bad, hard to keep in stock when store manager cancels your stock orders and doesn't tell you. All operations that are for store management.Customer service, in-stock, supervisor duties, Manage co workers duties and responsibilities, hardest part of the job trying to circumvent the store manager. Customer service is the best part."
good,Constantly had back injuries because of all the heavy lifting tasks. The only training preformed was on computers but it was not nearly enough of what was needed to know. There were little to no benefits for part time workers.
good,"The department supervisors were supportive to their staff but were limited by the assistant store managers and department managers."
good,"When I first started at Home Depot, the morale was high, had better management and sales were soaring. Within the 4 years I've been working there we've constantly changed management , we lost our best Pro sales department head 2 yrs in to my work history and now sales are at an all time low as is the morale throughout the Seguin Home Depot."
good,"As an employee at The Home Depot much has been learned. A typical day at work is exciting yet exhausting. Mixing individualized colors for customers is my main job. helping customers individually with their specific ideas and projects is enjoyable, makes you feel like you're a part of the project plus is also great feeling like you've been help. I have learned that patience is the key to working in retail. The hardest part of my job would be the physical labor and the lack of help you're given. Also more support from management would be great but overall working for Home Depot is good experience."
good,"Insufficient pay, lack of opportunity, poor management, vast tendency to severely underrate its employees. Poor business people in general in many ways."
good,"The Home Depot is a good place of employment for those looking to gain entry level experience in the work force and for those attending school. They are very accommodating when it comes to school. Where they fail to provide incentive is when an employee learns a useful skill such as obtaining their in house forklift license, there is nothing gained from achieving a skill such as this(i.e. pay raise or acknowledgement). However, one thing the home depot excels at is hiring, management hires people that fit well within the present community of home depot associates."
good,I like what i do I just need a change. I need to work for a company that is more fun. Wants their employees to be with their families. I just don't get that feeling from The Home Depot.
good,Home Depot is a great company that provides ample opportunities for career advancement and offers an ability to network with professional customers. You are granted autonomy to grow the business and are challenged to grow your own business by designing your own displays and creating your own style in merchandising.
good,"Working at Home Depot has been challenging to say the least. I personally started working at the Norfolk Home Depot after the agency I was working for closed their doors. I am grateful for the Home Depot giving me the opportunity to work because I was in desperate need of an income after losing my job abruptly, but the experience has been challenging. I state this more so due to the fact that the store does not believe in allowing individuals to earn a decent living by not providing the opportunity for overtime, and a minimal hourly pay rate. I don't want to sound like I am bashing the employer because like any job there are some good days, but at the same time, for those that only have one job, there is no way that you can survive off the amount you make at the Home Depot unless you are in a management position."
good,Over worked the employees. No chance of moving up in the company. The management team likes to pick favorites. I do not like working here
good,Home Depot is a great company. They are dedicated to our community and have a great ethic when it comes to hiring those that would otherwise be left to have no goals or future.
good,Home Depot was amazing to work for.....at first. After spending time with the company it was clear that Asset Protection (which was my position) more a complete throw away position. After hearing that AP and HR had gone through several size reductions it was tough to determine if there was a future for career growth with this company.
good,"I liked the people there that I worked with but the management was not good. they were never around."
good,learned a lot about home improvement got a lot with all the employees and was a forklift trainer for the store I was assigned to
good,"I have once heard The Home Depot was a great job to work at. The day I got hired, The particular store was washed out (i.e. new management) On top of that, the company had a lot of changes that was more beneficial for the company than their employees. I began to hear store-wide that the management in each store had a lack of professionalism and understanding with their employees"
good,There are many opportunities to advance in the company. The only thing is that they rarely offer set schedules or days off. Its retail so that is typical. The workers are great and most mangers are willing to help.
good,"Typical day: Putting the Customer first"
good,"Stressful and there is no Job Work/Life Balance at all. There is no provision of training and direction to achieve operational goals. Also constantly depressing environment and missing key business indicators to identify problems, concerns, and opportunities for improvement to achieve personal and company goals."
good,"Three leads per day, six days per week. Hours range from 58 to 60 per week."
good,They only care about themselves. They don't hire enough people to work the departments. Half the time management is gone and doesn't answer their phones. They think you don't notice but everyone notices. Not enough people are trained well enough. Great place to start out but unless you get promoted to a manager or go to corporate somehow its just a normal like college kid job.
good,"Not fun at all, management is not supportive and occupied by own agendas, also not qualified for their positions as management.  Heavy with day to day politics, passing the buck."
good,"Home depot has great employees. For the most part we all worked together to get the job done and had fun doing it. For this being my first ""warehouse"" job i learned a great deal about home improvement. The problem began when we became short handed and was expected to cover up to 4 departments sometimes by ourselves. Management was not very helpful or understanding while we were understaffed."
good,"This would be an excellent place to work, but your experience will be highly dependent on your management team. The team at the Champaign location is in need of reshuffling."
good,"great place to work, great team and lots of opportunities to learn.  great training program and feedback and opportunities to advance."
good,"Home Depot is a customer-based company who believes that the company is only productive when the customers needs are met on a regular basis, as the customers make the base of the inverted pyramid structure. Second-most essential aspect according to Home Depot are it's employees, which they take care of via Employee Discounts, Health and Retirement Benefits, and an option to benefit from the company's growth with a stock purchasing program. "
good,"While I was with this company I saw a massive expansion happen in just my region doing 5-6 stores a year. New manageres learning positions and being taught how things actually work at the store level by the experience associates. District manageres being grabbed from other companies i.e. Radio Shack, Best buy, Walmart. Not understanding DSG. Corporate level failures in logistics for new stores and support of existing stores. It always seemed like the existing stores would lose inventory to fill a new store. A lot of restructuring taking place as well as expansion into other revenues."
good,"I liked working with co-workers, especially when you can have fun and still do your work. My superior chose me to lead a special project and when they was upset with me , my superior would go to my team and speak of the project without me even being there."
good,"Fast-paced environment. Lots of weekend, holiday and late night hours. Pay is competitive for management, not for associates. Hours long. Very high turnover. Vacation, personal and sick time adequate. Not many full-time positions available. Part time associates average 12-18 hours per week. Lot's of diversity. Lots of bending and lifting. Strict customer service expectations and measures to be achieved."
good,"Poor pay for hard, physical work. Company policy of ""keep isles clear of obstructions"" is violated by projects, and corporate greed by placement of product in isles to ""drive sales"". Night management must call every hour for lights to be turned on so team members can work. The ""Homer Fund"" to assist associates in financial need is a good idea; however, employees put money into the fund, and when it's needed, employees must put money into it again. If the amount is  enough, Corporate releases double the amount...from the account associates already paid into."
good,"Management of the Company overall is good but implementation at store level of policy is hit or miss do to favoritism. Goals for equality and balance are good and altruistic but this can lead to people being able to work the system. Those that can, can go far. As an Associate life is fairly easy at The Home Depot. Once you get to Dept. Supervisor or higher you have to really watch what you say. The mantra of ""Do unto other as you would like to be treated yourself"" doesn't work here. You have to go by the rule of ""Do unto others better and nicer than you would expect to be treated yourself? and you will protect yourself which is necessary here while still being able to do your job."
good,With me being in management for the last 9 years I have learned to value the associates and treat them as I want to be treated . I enjoy teaching and training the associates everything I have learned in my 26 years in retail so that they can use it in everyday customer service to make the customers experience an excellent experience .
good,"A typical day at work involves answering and transferring inbound calls, ringing up merchandise, returns, and expediting special order merchandise. Nice management and co-workers. It can be challenging at times because you have to deal with upset customers and when you call for assistance in different departments, the associates are not always available to help due to there being a skeleton crew. The upside is that you meet new, interesting people working here and you can become life long friends with frequent customers. If you can get full time the job can be a rewarding experience."
good,"Its a face paced. Building a environment for homeowners and contractors, to obtained the materials required to complete their projects or contracts."
good,"Not great management. Decent pay, tough customers. Not given the proper tools to effectively solve problems. Somewhat stressful but overall easy."
good,"worked morning and evenings, help people find thing then help them out of the store also making sure they find what they needed"
good,My day started with helping customers as the day went on I had to stock or down load product for the following day. There were times I had to help other departments. Within my department there were also times I had to explain to my customers how to use certain tools or install electrical outlets. My day at times became so busy that there were no time for breaks.
good,"Facility is way too big for the current management  and you to be able to have one on one time, every manager is trying to get the job done building their associates but fall short of this so as a result they tend to stick to their favorites. Big issues in the operations process pertaining to accountability. There is also a big problem with productivity and how associates become productive scanning one pallet into five different locations before loading it onto the truck, when it's only necessary to  scan into only two locations. Because of this  unreasonable goal set by management it has raised tension among the associate to take drastic measures in the process, creating more work and becoming less efficient.  This will ultimately bring down the morale in the warehouse  and become more destructive then good."
good,"At home depot you will be asked to help pull up stock,load cars, help customers, and hunt down prices for iteams that are not marked. there isnt much room for movment around the store. when you are hired for one thing that will be all you work, so if ur looking for a job where u can move around and learn diffrent departments this is not for you"
good,"Let's get the negative out of the way first. As an associate, you'll be compensated far too little for what you're expected to be responsible for, you'll disagree with management (both store and corporate) more than you'll agree, and you'll probably be frustrated with the scheduling system (either too few hours, or too many at times you don't want them) to an impressive degree. "
good,"Typically would help customers for first half hour of shift because there wasn't anyone working in lumber/building materials department. Store would close and  I would put palleted freight away until the assistant manager opened back roll up door in order to bring lumber, drywall, and building materials into store. After that I would put lumber away using larger forklift. If there was drywall, I would stack along wall in lumber. If overstock, then strapped, tagged, and put into overheads. This took until lunchtime. After lunch stocked lumber in lumber aisle. For overstock I would have to down stock any possible lumber in order to make room for today's lumber. This would take until 5 a.m. typically. Would then switch to reach truck (if available) in order to put away building materials pallets such as fast set, studs, fencing, ladders, bricks, concrete and insulation. The store would open at 6 a.m., usually meaning no more using heavy equipment. I would then stock all remaining  loosely palletized freight. Normally I would have to spend up to an hour overtime to finish my freight. All other freight associates by then have moved their remaining freight back to receiving, where as i wasn't afforded this option."
good,"Make price tags for products to ensure that they are correct. Dust shelves, and set planograms. Very early in the morning and never know what your hours are going to be from day to day"
good,Poor close-minded overall job-culture. Little to no advancement opportunity and was basically terminated because of a job-related injury without advance notice.
good,"I saw some good points, however; I am not very familiar with all the depts., I learned to push myself more. Some co-workers were hard working and dependable. The hardest part was finding time to organize because of the huge inventory. Accomplishment is a reward anywhere."
good,"greet and meet customer"
good,A typical day started with me having to do someone else's job or helping someone else or getting stuck helping someone else. I learned that the managers wouldn't stand behind you. Also how to operate a forklift. My coworkers were pretty cool. Hardest part of the job was getting at least one day off a week. The most enjoyable part was not having to cover shifts for other people if it could be helped.
good,"There is little to no room for advancement, how you promote within the company is to be best friends with upper management. As a department supervisor they expect far to much from you, and don't compensate you very well."
good,"A typical day at work is being bombarded with customers with no help from managers even if its absolutely necessary.I learned a lot at home depot through the computer training and the hands on training from experienced associates.The management is horrible  they don't work with employees well, they engage in targeting and cant be found or tracked down when you are in need if them.The hardest part of the job is the non assistance of management and lack of employees.The most enjoyable part of the job is the great customers and coworkers"
good,"My position with this company involved working the late night shift to replenish merchandise in the Garden Department. This entailed pulling pallets of Garden Department merchandise out of the stockroom to the sales floor to be unwrapped and delivered to the appropriate areas in the department. This also entailed climbing ladders to stock bulky items on top shelves when space on designated shelves was already full."
good,Working on the freight team is a labor intensive job.  I learned how to drive every lift truck in the store.  The most difficult part of the job is the pace.  It is very quick and demanding.
good,it was a okay place to work as a college student. from being a cashier to loading was a good job. the enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,if you want a part time job it is perfect. full time wise it is a little risky. not enough hours and the company treats you like you are scum. too much work not enough pay.
good,The past two years at The Home Depot have been good because of the amazing co-workers I've had while I was working there. I've also met wonderful customers while working at The Home Depot.
good,"A typical day includes stocking inventory, and lots of customer service. The major thing I learned was time management and patience. Management can be difficult to explain, some really enjoyed their job and cared about the employees and how much their overall effect actually has on the company. While others scrapped by on the bare minimum. They are not always so willing to help you accomplish a task and not usually very forthcoming with knowledge if you had a question. A similar thing can be said about the staff, there is a distinct and noticeable difference is the quality of service you may receive depending on who you speak with. I felt that most of the staff/management was their to collect a check and did not enjoy their job in the slightest bit. The hardest part of the job is not only being responsible for your assigned task but often picking up the slack from you fellow co-workers while trying to maintain efficient and friendly customer service.The MOST enjoyable part of the job would be actually working with the customers, yes home depot is a home improvement/emergency store but most of the customer were kind and patient with you. The over all satisfaction of being able to help a person find the products they need to complete their task is very rewarding, especially when they take the time to come back to tell you and show you how well everything worked out."
good,Co workers are great and i enjoyed working with a lot of people. I made a lot of friends. However everyone who works at depot has two jobs because it is impossible to survive off of just a job at home depot. The hours are terrible and combined with the pay you end up with pretty much nothing. They always promise the opportunity for full time but never deliver. Most people I know who work at home depot are very unhappy there.
good,I did not like my time with homo depot. not a culture for a straight man to work in. to get ahead you need to be a gay woman from what I recall.
good,"I was the inventory control person that ordered the elecrtical and plumbing supplies and kept up on the merchandise for these departments. The coworkers and customers were a lot of fun. Some of the managers were interested in doing a good job, and others were just doing thier time at the store looking to be promoted."
good,It's an okay job.  The hours are sporadic and not as flexible as you would think.  The job is not trying or particularly difficult but it is dull and the entire company is managed porrly.
good,My daily activities consist of preparing your chosen department and making it presentable for customers and accessible to the products for purchase.
good,"Mixing paint and stocking shelves, assisting customers, Keeping area clean, out of stock updates, signing, new set ups daily training from vendors."
good,"Large company with stable employment."
good,"Always something to do, cashiers are empowered when it comes to making decisions within reason."
good,I would count my register and wait on customers. The hardest part of the job is having to lift heavy items .
good,"Great Benefits for the employees, great discounts with other companies like restaurants and retail stores etc. You meet some great people along the way."
good,"I was a Front End Supervisor (FES) I created schedules, customer service, training, hiring, and product control."
good,"check inventory levels"
good,I really enjoyed working with this organization.  They offered great benefits packages and employee discounts.  One of the major flaws was it was hard to advance to upper management.
good,"It is a nice workplace environment, and isn't too stressful while studying either."
good,pues llegaba directopor el montacargas saludaba y me ponia a travajar
good,"Receive all incoming stores and supplies, unload trucks, pull and back stock stores, load trucks assist customers deal with vendors, secure high item stores. Maintain filing system and enter all data on windows based computer system."
good,"A typical day at work for me was taking care of the needs of the customers by checking out their items. I also worked up at the customer service desk handling accounts of the customers , handling site to store  orders from online orders and other work retaining to that, as well as many organizing needs for the department of Customer service and the front end."
good,All in all my time spent at The Home Depot was enjoyable. It had it's negative moments just like all jobs do at one point or another. The only thing that prevented me from continuing my employment with The Home Depot were several employee's attitudes towards my self and other younger Associates. They slowly turned the idea of going to work into a stressful necessity. After several talks with Manager's about co workers attitude problems and seeing nothing change I put in my notice and ended my employment with The Home Depot when it was finished.
good,"Great job while going to school"
good,"•	Bar-coding Employee Social Security Information (Date Entry)"
good,Great place to gain experience and learn about retail and warehousing but not a place to have a career
good,"I would drive any where from Williamsburg to Elizabeth City, depending on my route, to measure for flooring in the customers homes. I was trained to use a Samsung tablet using CAD software to perform my duties. I worked alone and was in contact with supervisor via email, text or phone. Measuring some of the unique floor plans of this region was the hardest part of the job. Solving the challenge of ways to measure the aforementioned floor plans was the most enjoyable and rewarding parts of the job.."
good,"Don't expect anything other than a good PT job here. Good working environment mainly due to the other associates you work with. Of course that changes from store to store. Management has always been lack-luster for me, but that is mainly due to Corporates regulations."
good,"genre de travail â mon image"
good,Work life balance is average for hourly employees and poor for salaried employees.
good,"la preparacion del turno es un tramite ya que tienes que visualisar propiamente las necesidades tambien como asi la gerencia te dara actividades de lo que tienen como punto relevante para el turno "
good,"Its very busy, customers are every where and everyone wants your help with something their working one. The set isn't fair once a year employees only get one raise, which isn't no more then 20 cents goes for full-time employees as well as the part-time employees. Its just hard to try make a move up the ladder because everyone is trying to make the same move and the process is a very long process. During your time while your working there your living next to property. Insurance is expensive and the work wears down your body. Also no body cares how your doing either everyone is every man for themselves."
good,Unload trucks receive in product. the hardest part of my job is not telling supervisors how things would be better and giving my suggestions. My coworkers all feel the same and are great to work with.
good,"School like environment managers talk to associates like children, no one  ever works in the area they are assigned to. Company policy is violated by management to fire associates."
good,"Sales, design, custom ordering and getting each and every customer in and out in a timely fashion.Learned a vast amount of products and how to better our service. Co workers were always respectful and helpful."
good,"I learned more about customer service at the Home Depot than I have anywhere. However, the associates are micromanaged to a point of almost inefficiency and most times customer service suffers due to this."
good,"A normal day would involve coming in, sorting 15+ pallets of goods into different departments, then going out and stocking the shelves. Nothing was learned at this job since we only had to match numbers/labels to find out where everything went. Management was okay, they would normally help but in a way that they did not have to do much heavy lifting. I did not get to interact with co-workers as we were all put on different departments and talking for more then a minute was frowned on. The hardest part of the job was all the heavy lifting. I cannot think of anything about that job that I enjoyed."
good,"A typical work day included welcoming customers, answering their questions, and helping them purchase their items. I learned a lot about diy projects and contractor projects. My management was always willing to help from tough customers to personal matters. Most of my coworkers were great to work with very friendly and patient. I believe that the hardest part of my job was when we foreign speakers. The best part of my job was helping a customer gather all the products they need to help them complete their project."
good,"well, it was all great at first until  I was falsely accused. I will never again step foot at this location."
good,Would prefer not to post. I would like to keep this private. Customers came first always.
good,Typical day at work would consist of a lot of lifting and walking around. Helping customers and watering the plants at the garden department. Cleaning and facing different departments at the store. Management was okay at Home Depot.
good,My experience with my co-workers was great. It was the rotating door of management that was off putting. Three managers and two supervisors within two years was confusing. They all brought their own ideals with them and it was overall frustrating.
good,"they have table tennis and tv, good work place, management not so much."
good,"Home Depot was not bad to me, i worked hard, collected a paycheck. If you are a full time employee, say goodbye to any flexibility as far as your personal time and scheduling. If you are part-time, you can essentially write your schedule. But you won't work more than minimum hours per week. Home Depot breeds management from within, while this could be nothing but positive, generally, it creates a work environment rife fraternization and favoritism. Personal conflict and hostility. I was lucky enough to only witness this from the outside. This company was definitely an amazing corporation to work for, ten years ago. I only hope they find that spark again that made them the go-to for quality employment."
good,the Home Depot gave me income and thats about all. It seemed almost impossible to actually grow within the company. The management was alright. I bet if i was to walk into Home Depot the manager wouldnt even remember me and i was there top stock guy for an entire year. Pay could have been better as well as the hours.
good,"low hourly pay, raises are .25 year standard, inconsistent hours."
good,"I like doing this kind of work and talking to people, but I am required to drive all over the capital district daily."
good,"As a part-time employee, I was not eligible for insurance benefits. I took the job to survive and now look forward to working in my field."
good,"I worked in several different areas.  I started out unloading trucks and stocking the floor.  I later worked in the lumber department spending most of my time processing special orders. I really enjoyed this time at the store and my relationship with my co-workers.  I soon became an area manager as the head cashier.   "
good,Overall great experience working their. Learned plenty of tips and trades on how to repair items.
good,"A typical work day included finding the department supervisor at the beginning of your shift in order to find out what your duties were for the day. The duration of the shift was  cleaning your assigned area and keeping it full for customers. In order to keep the assigned area clear, machineries had to be used to bring down pallets. When the company hired new associates I would help train them and show them company guidelines. I learned how to work with a team to meet goals. The most important thing I learned was how to listen in order to find out the customers needs. Some of the management personnel were disconnected with their associates therefore, it was not an effective management system. However, the managers that connected with the associates always had a positive work relationship with the associates. The hardest part of the job was that not all the team members put in equal amount of work so other people had to compensate for them. Another difficult part of the job was working with managers that abused their power. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with team members and since we all got along the work days were short."
good,"Being a cashier for almost a year, I could argue that my fellow cashiers here were often late or slow which would cause huge lines and create a stressful environment at times. Hardest part of the job has to be the scheduling, every week you had a different schedule which causes problems with your family, school and social life. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out, as cashiers you are told to have fast lines and fast checkout while pushing credit cards and other merchandise down the customer's throat not to mention the long lines that would occur it made for a horrible shopping experience."
good,It's a fast paced retail environment.I've learned multiple skills over the years Including problem solving. The hardest part of the job is the swing hours. It makes it difficult to work and have a life/ go to school etc. I find the programs I've developed and started very rewarding.
good,"The Home Depot was not the best experience for me, the culture was  focused on trying to get the most for themselves more than growing new associates. Management was always favoring certain employees and my requests for my drill weekends seemed to be a bother."
good,A typical day revolves around customers. You will learn a lot working for HD as there traing is some of the best I have seen.
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers find products to fit their needs, educating them on the specific products and all that it does, as well as checking the customer out and ensuring that they are happy with the product of their choice. I have learned that the more flexible your hours are, the better the chance of actually getting decent hours.  The management could do a better job at scheduling enough to make sure the store is not understaffed, but overall they do an adequate job. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the different products that the store has to offer. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the customer is satisfied with the product that you helped pic for them."
good,Not enough people to cover an area. Pay is low. Never could find management when needed. No direction.
good,"If you are looking for a place that doesn't pay much and doesn't ask much, this is the place for you."
good,"Landed a job with this company with a promise of a promotion at the earliest opportunity. As this promotion  didn't materialize within a reasonable time, I looked for a position elsewhere."
good,"What i did at Home Depot was loading customers vehicles correctly And working lumber isle and saw."
good,"Working in retail is very tough, because few customers never satisfy inspite of your best effort otherwise it was fun"
good,"i would get the garden center restocked and updated to the planograms sent to us, i also kept the outside area clean. once the garden area was up and running i worked overnight stocking things and using forklifts to put things in higher racks to make room for more inventory"
good,"They need more security, but it is a decent place to work. It's a learning experience."
good,"A typical day at home depot was a lot of running around without any organization, with 2 or 3 employees having to go and help in a different department leaving theirs unattended and the customers without help. "
good,Just bosses kept changing and now not sure what happened.I do not see any of the people I worked with anymore.
good,"very fast paced , weekends are always busy, diverse atmosphere,flexible schedule at all times, not enough hours."
good,"A very busy and intense place to work. Associates, with a few exceptions, are underpaid  which leads them to be unproductive. The few productive associates are generally overworked because they are known to be productive and receive the vast majority of the workload. Management is often unavailable and distant and unconcerned with the balance of the workload. Customers are very often rude and entitled and it requires a thick skin to maintain employment. The lack of oversight is enjoyable for self-motivated associates but an overall hindrance as the associates with less than desired integrity tend to take advantage. It is, however, a very stable company that rarely tends to lay off associates."
good,My day would start at 4 am and end at 1 pm they started to cut my hour back and I have a 45 minutes drive there and back. The manager was shady he couldn't be trusted. I enjoyed working with the people but if you complained enough you got your way and the people who did there job with out complaining got over look. I learn a lot about people and remolding your home.
good,"Store managers are forced to monitor staffing on a daily basis to meet sales objectives, and whenever sales are lower than plan, associates are requested to ""leave early"" and some are contacted prior to shift and told to stay home. This creates a wave of frustration to the remaining associates to ""cover"" other departments. Then the evening shift is required to replenish inventory levels and other duties that should have been completed. Department heads are promoted in mysterious ways, and some excel, while others create confusion."
good,The Home Depot was an okay experience. Unfortunately i worked the 3rd shift from 8pm to 5am. Managers were rarely in the store within the hours i was there so the amount of effort i put into my work was barely recognized
good,"it is nice to work at The Home Depot because you can go to work wearing whatever you have on, you just put an apron on and get to work."
good,The training was good. Most of my co-workers were good people. If you like retail it is probably an above average job.
good,Very physically demanding job. Sales Associates had no set hours or set days off.  Work schedule all over the map. Difficult to get an occasional weekend off. If you had any grievance you felt like you had no recourse.
good,"Management plays favorites, does not listen to complaints"
good,attended to incoming customers and directed them to appropriate departments as needed. unable to advance within company.and working with personal schedule was impossible.
good,"The employees are great to work with, Management has a little to desire. They believe that hiring management from within which is great, but none of them are educated on any kind of business."
good,"It was an ok place to work. However, part time seems to be almost 30 hours a week. Hello, most of us have full time jobs."
good,hours weren't great and it was a my way or the high way type attitude
good,"Very hard worker and enjoy to have things to be ready for next day, but no support, lack of evidence on workers, they not seriously, but I learned a lot to many things, customers, respect, patient and services"
good,"Home Depot is the epitome of corporate retail conglomerations trying to rule the world.  Or maybe they're just trying to build the world, albeit inexpensively and with substandard products. Best of luck to them."
good,"fast pace work place , great employees to work with , the store management are awesome , the pay rate is horrible"
good,The job itself was very easy didn't allow much room for growth within the company or position. Unless you have a desire to be a store manager this job didn't fulfill much of the desires that I had.
good,"Totally corporately mis-guided. There is no honest and good in middle management. And no recourse for the worker bees who will not engage in the disgusting behavior displayed by said middle management. Loved working with customers and other employees. Sadly, some great and good people overlooked for promotion. Too many personal agendas! Shame, I spent lots of time doing for a company that is so disfuctional and dishonest."
good,It was just OK.  Not bad if you're OK with retail.  I don't want to type any more.
good,"Typical day is hands on learning "
good,"My reviews were very good. But, in the last year with the VOC requirement the job was not the same any more unfortunately."
good,OK at first. the up to date training. turn over is bad. Co-workers are great. Not being told when someone is not coming in. I coming in to work.
good,"Checking out customers at cash register. I learned how to scan items quickly, process credit card, open new accounts, and process checks. Good management and friendly co-workers. Handling heavy plywood was the hardest and I enjoyed busy days cause it made work more challengine."
good,We were overstaffed with tenured floor assistance that did not want to give up the reigns to allow help.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot is usually working very early, or working the late shift. You have about 5 or 6 managers that are on schedule on any given day. Some days its hard to know who to call if you have an emergency, because they could be anywhere from the Garden Center, to in the back office. When you first start at Home Depot, they tell you that your hours are based on your availability. This is only half true, because the solid hours lie with the full time people, and it trickles down from there. Don't expect to get the good hours unless you stick around for a while, or your schedule is totally open,and you don't have another job. The starting pay is $9.00 an hour, you most likely will be hired as a part time associate, and you are not eligible for a raise, until you've been there for a year. The benefits package also isn't that great, but  if you don't have insurance already, it is what it is. You will also gain alot of customer service experience at HD, and most of this will  be through trial and error. By this, I mean dealing with some angry, unappreciative, customers. For the most part,most customers just want to know they are being listened to and receive great customer service, but the ones that are used to verbally abusing the associates and getting away with it, will expect you to tend to their every whim. The best you can do in these situations is keep a good attitude,and don't give them any ammunition to go to management about. What else? Oh coworkers! It's a mixed bag really. Your coworkers can vary from really cool people, to consummate butt kissers, who have"
good,It was not enough hours. I loved working in the garden center.
good,When I used to work there I was always looked at negatively by the managers and was treated un-fairly from the supervisor. I would always do my job above and beyond and would get no recognition for my hard work.
good,Management was helpful and so were co-workers.  did not pay very well and is hard to get fultime
good,Fast pace. Product knowledge. Overall good management staff. Well rounded associates. Keeping department cleaned. Going home is the most enjoyable.
good,"I work on the merchandising side but I started off as a cashier, moved to a garden associate, then a bay integrity associate plus a merchandising team member.  I enjoy my position but I want to be a full time worker and they are not offering it at this time. I enjoy my team for the most part because we are able to work as a unit and get our projects and bays completed in a timely manner."
good,"-Very fast paced, large workloads, interacting with co-workers and customers."
good,"If your store management is not good, it's a bad place to work. My Asst Store Managers were very good, but the Store Manager illegally fired me for personal reasons that I didn't get the truth until 2 years later - when she was fire for it."
good,"Clock in at 10pm, break down freight and stock items in the proper departments. The lead manager was a horrible leader and seemed to have a revolving issue with just about every employee on the night crew. I had great co-workers they worked hard, showed up on time and got the job done. The hardest part of the job was giving your all while and being short changed by the company. No recognition, no rewards, no acknowledgement etc."
good,"I thought this was going to a great place to work to obtain a few hours per week to make some extra spending money."
good,"Started at the home depot in 2010, There is a lot of knowledge and experience that can be gained by working at the home depot.My most busy days are monday and Fridays, 4 hrs is spent on the computer (reading/writing documents, emailing, creating templates,reading state,etc.) the other 4-6 are spent managing my team, delegating/following up on work assignments, labor,etc) "
good,"No room to advance beyond part time. when a full time position opened, they would hire two new part timers to full it. not move a part timer up to full time."
good,"A typical day at work is getting bad looks, customers throwing trash every where to be collected . Some pretty nice managers who sympathize with Lot Associates but feel as though they're idiots . The most enjoyable part is nothing. Co-workers are decent . I have learned nothing but the web learning."
good,"worked with bathroom supplies, kitchen supplies, warehouse distribution type work it was ok i just couldnt do this and college"
good,A typical work day constituted of having a meeting and planing out the work day. Ones we was had our meeting we start to load shelves with predictor in our assigned. My co-worked at times we hard working and others laed back while others like worked.
good,"My time at the Home Depot was a great learning experience where I met amazing people. A typical day is rather unpredictable, one day you could have a project to work on, another it could be extremely slow with not much to do, and most common was a hectic day with too much to do and no time to do it but somehow you are able to get it done. For all the experience I gained the main negative factor in my particular store was management..it reminded my of a highschool clique..it shouldn't do that for me."
good,"A typical day involved helping customers find/suggest products that suit there needs, restocking and keeping the place generally clean. I learned a lot about home improvement. My co-workers were all pretty nice people, some better than others of course. Hardest part of the job would be enduring the lack of good, competent leaders. And again the best part of the job was meeting/helping people."
good,"working with customers is fulfilling for me "
good,"A good part time job for a young person."
good,people in store were great. overtime requires but taken back at end of week. Learned management by heading different depts in Home Depot.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were meeting new people and interacting with each other and different personalities. Typical day at work customers first. I learn to be friendly and work well with others as team players. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the registers and floor associates when in use of assistance.
good,"Typical day at work is standing around waiting for customers to come into the store, or need help."
good,"I like that I was able to learn know thing. It is a friendly place to work for,"
good,Extreme hourly shifts and hardly no work/life balance.  They hire you quickly and if your not determined you will not make it.  The same goes to your employees that are hired for you.  You did not have any say as who is hired for your department even though you have more insight about your departments.
good,"A typical day was fine.  Breaks encouraged but was no allowed to use my talents.  Sold $30,000 in product and  no one knew it."
good,"enjoyed my time at the garden (for the most part), enjoyed coming in early to help with prep, cleaning duties and absolutely loved the owner but the manager was incompetent. he had no food service experience which i am willing to overlook but really when it came to prep, managing staff and most other duties (excluding opening and closing duties) he was worthless. before i move on i will say that there was a great deal of shadiness to this business in that they had long standing debts, DID NOT PAY US OUR TIPS and did not welcome any changes to the menu. What I did like is the fact that we were fed, are hours were pretty much set and I really enjoyed our location in town which made it very easy to walk outside grab a coffee next door and we had a lot of regulars that I really enjoyed! I enjoyed the opportunity to work in a position where I was able to learn some more about veg/vegan cooking and thank them for the experience but when I was told that they were moving their business and that i would have to reapply for my job i had no problem telling them off. no hard feelings, it was a job when i needed it and just that."
good,"Ok company, low compensation not equally balanced, promote from outside"
good,A typical day requires each employee to be able to multi task
good,"Home Depot is a good job ton have. Not really flexible with your schedule. Has had different managers and supervisors, so the store in Tuscaloosa has changed a lot."
good,The work was okay but very tiring but the hours were not consistant as a seasonla worker past the midway point in the season
good,This great starter place to work world. Sometime the customer step over line but other that its great.
good,"The pay is decent for this kinda of job but should pay more for what you actually do, Monday thru Friday 6 to 3 is great, and unheard of in retail.  Management is useless, the other associates are even more useless and management turns a blind eye to the fact you end up doing everyone jobs, and fixing everyone mistakes."
good,"Management made sure we always started the week with the Home Depot Cheer!  This really kept you motivated and customer focused.   "
good,"I love going to my job every weekend. It involves working with customers and other manufactures representatives. My co-workers and I have team meetings weekly to discuss the high and Lows of the Appliance Department and how we can get better. To know that I have a title to live up to, like providing great customer service, be sufficient and have a can do attitude makes my job enjoyable. The best part of about my job, are the customers. They give me the desire to feel their need or wants, to give them hope on their vision and turn them into reality. I have experience times when I failed on not full feeling a customers need of which they counted on me to feel. I've always told myself in times like this ""You see a need: full feel a need"". so as long as I can provide that it doesn't matter about the failures."
good,"A typical day at work as a HR Analyst is just like any other day in a call center but if you are looking for a career that offers healthy challenges to overcome, this is not the best job for you. I've been fortunate enough to create solid friendships with management along with coworkers. The most difficult part of the job is the repetitive nature of the job that wears you down mentally and physically. You have forty-seconds before the next call comes through and hardly any downtime which leaves you with the choice of putting yourself in ACW just to take a breath which will surely negatively impact your adherence. There is no stability especially as a contractor because you may come in one day and find that day to be your last day simply because your name among others has been shaved off. The recruiting agency involved in this assignment is very protective of those that work their best and they keep you working there as long as they can. I have seen so many be taken off assignment and return a week later because of  unforeseeable workload necessity. On a very positive note, this is an environment that strives to build its own work community and there are a lot of opportunities to become a permanent fixture at the Home Depot if it is your goal to work in a call center environment until retirement."
good,"I have nothing special to say about the Home Depot. I worked as a cashier there. It was a fast-paced environment and fun to work in, with all of my coworkers being friendly people and management was great too. There was no compensation or benefits, not even a store discount, which was sort of a bummer."
good,"Home Depot is a good company and I work with  them for almost eleven years. The only downside of Home Depot is they never give you much training for advancement for your career. I was so eager to be promoted and willing to learn something new for the sake of the company but I was left behind. Instead they hired somebody else who is younger and maybe has more knowledge in technology than I am, that is why i decided to resigned and go back to school in order to learn something new.The work balance is the hardest. For somebody who has kids, you really need to sacrifice not to see them a lot because of the schedule.The most enjoyable part of my job is having fun with my co worker during Christmas season.We managed to put together an employee committee where we organize ourselves and built a fund raising campaign in order to raise money for the party and that is the most enjoyable thing that i experienced."
good,"Provide friendly, helpful, and satisfying customer service while managing other cashiers on their collective duties to maintain a positive and fruitful workplace"
good,Home Depot strives on bringing along current workers. But if they are hired on at 9 dollars an hour it is hard to keep them with 2.5 percent increases per year.
good,"Productive place to learn and grow in a field, that you would like to be in"
good,It was a great place to lean about the way the big box stores work
good,You will work a lot and get pushed to do things that you dont want to do.
good,It was not a bad company to work for but the pay was not the great and the work was rather hard.
good,"A typical day a Home Depot was filled with lifting heavy lumber. I learned about different woods, I learned how to make a Deck, I learned how to make different things. The management was never really around for questions, it was basically on you. The hardest part of the job was trying to answer a question that you didnt know how to answer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience."
good,High turnover rate. Management fails to motivate employees. Work place moral is very low. It's a poor working environment. Employee's aren't given the proper tools to ensure success. I've learned to stay positive and keep working towards success. This positive attitude ensures a great experience for the customers. The difficulty is long hours of standing.
good,"I have a job"
good,A day at work is lifeless. Plenty of negative energy moving throughout the store between the majority of  employees and managers. I've learned to be more outspoken and how to become a leader in my 2 years there. My Co-workers were really helpful and uplifting daily. The hardest part of the job was listening to managers that barely knew what they were doing. Very unorganized job and management. The most enjoyable part of the job honestly were my co workers in my department. We were real family oriented.
good,"I was a cashier that working outside in the hot weather all day long. Managment was hard to get ahold of and when u did call for them they took forever to get to where u were. On hot days they would not come out and check on u to see if u needed more breaks. I helped customers with plants, rang customers out, and dropped money. The best part of my job was learning about how plants work in different invirements. Worst part was how hot it was and not being able to go inside to cool off."
good,"Typical day at work follows, I spend a majority of my time helping customers in the lumber department, assisting them in small and large scale projects.  Other duties that I am tasked with are training new associates in the department, placing orders with venders, and loading/offloading lumber trucks."
good,But if you need a real job with hours and pay you can operate on then this is not for you.
good,"I worked at home depot, and I left to pursue other opportunities "
good,Good place to start working but the employees are some what unfriendly from night crew to day crew. Some people are nice and know how to treat their home depot family. 
good,i enjoyed working at home depot always busy never without work
good,"Typically assist customers with finding products. I have learned a handful of things from plants to lawn mowers. Management tends to disappear and be very hard to find and ask questions if you can't find the solution. Co-workers are decent people, but it tends to be hard to find them, as the store sometimes seems to be short handed, and employees find themselves in different departments to help. Hardest part is learning all the home improvement knowledge very quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and learning what they plan on doing as far as their projects and helping them find the right solution. "
good,"Worked in building and lumber, so it got to the point were management would schedule me on a shift by my self after not training me how to open/close the department and expect me to just guess. There was no direction on how to properly do things in the department. Was scheduled alone on morning where I would have to load over 3000 lbs of concrete by myself. "
good,the company has very good benefits.they need to work/life balance and they need to work core values
good,"overall the management was bad and would get mad if someone asked them for anything, most people there would leave work for me to do knowing i come in later and if it was left i would get the blame. "
good,"First priority was customer service, then material presentability and readiness for sales. I performed alot of store upgrades, promotional projects, and overall outstanding performance."
good,"Although the company itself is great to work for as their work/life balance ethic parallels with mine, when it comes to actual execution of this the reality appears to be fairly different from the philosophy. In Canada a new employee time schedule has been introduced called FAST. A computer is now setting up the work schedule which, I've been told, is based on sales done over the previous 2-3 years. The employees are completely governed by a computer. The department supervisors rarely make schedules adjustments and so now there are departments with no sales associates at all during certain times of the day. This increases customer DIS-satisfaction which, in fact, completely goes against THD's Customer First policy. "
good,You never have consistency with your days off. Hard to plan your life. Health benefits ok.
good,Help costumers with any questions regarding products and other sales items in my department. Brought down pallets of back stock with forklifts. The hardest part was having to do so many things at once and doing other people's work.  
good,"Managment at my store is not very good.Physically demanding.Customers can be very very rude and demanding.Sometimes it's great.I love my pay but overwhelmed most of the time with customers.People expect you to be an expert at everything,even outside your department.Not given much time to train.Not enough employees.Co-workers are amazing,I love most of them.Unstable hours.Sometimes you work too much,sometimes they cut hours.It's too unpredictable.I leave absolutely EXHAUSTED everyday."
good,"The Home Depot is a great employer to work for if you are willing to work hard.  The advancement opportunites are plentiful for those who are willing to listen, learn and go the extra-mile."
good,"the bonuses,merit awards,some associates,customers are great,the promotions,benefits,hours,incomes need improvements"
good,Family owned
good,"The typical day at work mainly included customer service. I often operated forklifts to load and stock product bays. Team work was a critical aspect of working at this store. In order for everything to run smoothly, being a good team player was key."
good,Very nice place to work Associates are really friendly good benefits
good,This is not a great place to work. I would not recommend working here.
good,"Typical day is helping customers with general questions. I learned A LOT about construction and design. Most people I work with are great, but there are the people who do not pull their weight, but that is pretty normal anywhere. The management unfortunately focuses on the negative and what we are not accomplishing instead of what we work hard to produce and acheive. The hardest part of the job is keeping your composure when you have a csr screaming at you when you are upholding the company policies only to have a manager come behind you and undermine your authority. The best part of the job is the great people working in the store that keep you going when you just want to walk out."
good,A typical day at work started with making all special orders in stock and out of stock. Preparing orders from customer to vendor expending from installer to customer I learned great customer service skills. The management has low values. My co-workers were friendly and nice. The hardest part of the job was the relationship between employees and management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,stand around as a cashier and wait till people go to your line to checkout
good,"Little room for advancement, contrary to what they tell you. Minimal pay. Home Cheap-O would be a better name. Unorganized."
good,"Frustrating part of the job is not having coverage to cover breaks and lunches or, during evening hours in department."
good,I have become a strong manager with the Home Depot but looking to expand my abilities in areas that are not offered with the company.
good,"Decent company, low pay and after working at there contact center for 8 months the announced the closing, soon after I left."
good,"It was a job like others, it will have its good and bad things but I was seeking for something more related to my career. There was no place for advancement and I was not satisfied because I know I am a very hard worker and I would push myself to do my best everyday I was there."
good,Nothing too bad about this company except that the two days you get off they are never ever back to back. The scheduled hours are just nonsense. Say goodbye to your social life.
good,Home Depot is an OK place to work. Just make sure you adhere to the attendance policy.
good,"Ten years with this fine company was quite a learning experience! The opportunities are endless, sadly the one key thing I learned was to be at one store for too long can be a bad thing rather than a good one."
good,"As a kitchen designer, my primary responsibility was meeting with clients in store or at their home, producing a design to their specifications and requirements, explaining appropriate products, installation issues and following up to insure customer satisfaction. These issues also included bath renovations and design."
good,"Everyone was fairly nice, I think the hardest part of the job is that there is not a lot of customers so it was hard to just stand there and not do anything; also the hours that part-time workers got were really bad."
good,"As a college student, it is a job that can help me get by for now but is not a long term option. As i near the end of my college career, i am seeking a more fullfilling and better compensating job. Home depot has taught me plenty which i am grateful for. Customer service and satisfaction is key to being successful and i am great at it."
good,very little OT
good,"Ive been with company for a little over a year and its been a pretty good ride... I work hard in outbound & fluid, building pallets. direct supervisor is great. constant lifting of paint, tile and fluids. pay is alright"
good,always work with not enough staff on hand to help everyone in a timely manner but that was my store the other stores may be different
good,"The schedule varies from 15-30 hours a week. It was very difficult when they changed managers, fired people for reasons that didn't make any sense, favoritism (I understand it happens everywhere, it was thick as molasses here). Management were awesome people outside of work, they didn't take their jobs seriously. Co-workers, how happy can working in retail make you. I apologize, but this was not for me. I learned how to be VERY patient. I enjoyed the customers the most. The hardest part was being reprimanded for things that others did which you took the fall for (overly so)."
good,"very fun place to work, clean enviroment, mangement went down hill after original promoted the new sucked, i still go back"
good,"There are no typical days, every day brings different aspects of the job. I learned flooring and electrical techniques. Management changed often, and does not communicate very well. Co-workers are fine. Hardest part of the job is switching tasks midstream. Most enjoyable part of the job is solving customers' issues."
good,"Good Atmosphere, Culture and Proposed Values are some of the best in the industry."
good,Good place to work if you're young and willing to work long and crazy hours doing anything and everything that might be involved in a retail situation. Good people to work with. Limited hours available unless you are open to working anytime between 5 AM & midnight. Low hourly rate with minimal percent increase. There are worse jobs but there are also better. All this also depends on which store you work in.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, but returned to Mississauga for personal reasons."
good,"Enjoyable but can get overwhelming, as any other retail. It can be hard at times to get any help since the store is always understaff."
good,fill shelves and attending to customers I have learned not all customers are the same and each one has to be to handled differently. I have learned that management were not all team players.My co-workers were the main reason I enjoyed going to work everyday. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unreasonable customers and trying to help these customers with problems and not suceeding. The most enjoyable part was helping people fulfill there dream project and encouraging them to try to do something they have never tried. Very Rewarding
good,Overall great company to work for I think it breaks down to the individual store having problems
good,"I have been employed here for 8 months and there is no room for promotion, shifts get cut and you can't make a living off here so be ready to work two jobs or pick this up for a few extra bucks or if you are retired. Advancement in nearly unachievable I have spoken to multiple employees whom have been there for 13 years and just then finally got their shot at full time employment and that was only because they severely needed the benefits which are very good and even offer part time benefits which is really nice. The other employees are nice management is so so but that varies so greatly i can't speculate. That's basically all I got."
good,It's fun to work with co-workers and managers. The main problems are the schedules and they don't give increase salary.
good,"Soon As I Hit The Floor My First Objective Is The Check For Any Safety Issues Then I Begin Our Morning Check List. After That's Done, I Walk My Dept. And Pack Down (Down Stock) The Shelves And Make Sure Everything Is Full And Ready To Be Sold. I Learned Everything In Every Dept. In Our Store, I Just Been Waiting To Move Up To Put My Skill To A Real Test. The Management Isn't The Best And To Be Honest Its Actually Poor. The Hardest Thing About My Job Is To Please Everyone In One Day Because Everyone Want Something Done A Certain Way. Most Enjoyable Part Even Is Working With All My Optimistic Coworkers And Assisting All Customers Leaving Them Smiling."
good,"This is a great place to work if you want to work part time. I learned a lot about home remodeling, painting a room or two, home decorating, yard care"
good,"I basically learned how to drive a forklift, reach truck, order picker, sleet machine, and an electric pallet jack. My co-workers are very helpful and are team players. The hardest part of my job is unloading the floor loaded truck. The most enjoyable is driving the machines and unloading trucks"
good,"help customer(s) find products, stock shelves, cashier, clean up and work erratic hours."
good,people at my job are friendly and we all get along well the only problem is the lack of growth in the company and people hired from outside to fill full time and management positions
good,"A typical day could begin whenever in the day depending on your position. Customer attitude is typically manageable, but there are days when that changes due to discrepancies in associate coverage. At the end of the day, you can expect to be tired from working as 'nothing to do' is rare."
good,"The job itself wasn't terrible, it just didn't pay enough to manage my finances well, and I had no experience in sales. Not a good combination for me. I'm sure others under the right circumstances would/will have a more positive experience with this company."
good,Home Depot sometimes cares more about their customers than they do their employees.
good,"The Home Depot was a lovely work experience, however they have very poor management at The Home Depot Ellesmere."
good,"Very good pay and benefit packages offered to all employess. Retirement packages were also very well structured. As in most corporations, upper management created unrealistic goals in an obvious attempt to make the company sonething it isnt. Home Depot has very few advancement opportunities unless you are willing to relocate. Most Store Managers I worked with would stab you in the back in a heartbeat to save their own jobs. Work life balance is basically non existent, it was all work"
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with horrible customers
good,"The pay is probably the worst, the work is easy when you get it down but the pay could be higher. The management sucks I've had 7 different supervisors in the 6 months I was there"
good,forklift work outside the store reach lift work inside the store and provide excellent customer service
good,I enjoyed the daily customers which sought our ideas and suggestions.
good,"A typical work day includes customer service ""FIRST"", generating sales, following up on with existing customers, restocking shelves and a lot of side projects to appeal to customers. Example; making tile, hardwood, laminate and carpet displays so customers can see the newest products. I have learned how to generate sales, give detailed information on how to complete any flooring project, how to lay any type of flooring (tile, hardwood, laminate, carpet/pad etc.), and how to multi-task during stressful situations. Management lacks many skills employees are required to know and they are rarely available when needed. Management also requires a lot from associates that are not in their job description. Co-workers are very friendly and constantly learning about products they offer to better help customers and using the necessary tools to do so. The hardest part of the job is multi-tasking in stressful situations with the lack of employees on the floor during the busiest times, i.e. weekends. Hours have been cut tremendously to save money which results in fewer associates on the sales floor at any given time. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and hearing them come back with successful stories of their projects."
good,This company is not for weak hearts. The money for management is great but for hourly employees it is poor. Zero life work balance.
good,clock in go to department check in on l talkies great customer service management always around coworkers had dedication to one another out in the sweltering heat cleaning up the lot but helping customers load there vehicles and the looks on there faces
good,"Very busy which makes time fly. Hours are very erractic, benefits are good"
good,"It's an okay place to work. Just watch your back. Job Security is tough here, they can get you on anything and they will."
good,"As a MET Team Employee I had probably more fun than most. We often reset steel shelving for the purpose of displaying new products. General Maintenance, not so fun."
good,They had been a very good company to work for. Though they did not pay too well. But I had worked with my co-workers for years and when ever something happen we would bond together to help out our peers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is working with customers and helping them find what they need. The hardest part is knowing customers steal stuff but having limit to stopping them. I love my co-workers even though there is a lot of drama there. I am friends with everyone there. Management is okay. They do not want to work to well with schedules and try to punish people for it. There is also not a lot of opportunities to advance with-in the company. I have learned a lot of how to deal with unhappy customers and how to fix schedules so shifts are covered. A typical day of work consists of helping customers, dealing with returns, and ringing customers' merchandise, as well as handling money."
good,"-cashier, make sure everything you need to serve the customer is at hand,"
good,Maintain routine lines of communication with customer service and merchandising departments.
good,"Most days are fine, but often someone would slack off and create a huge problem and dump solving it off on the freight team. I learned that the people that do all the manual work at big company's don't mean anything as compared to the sales people. Everyone was nice for the most part, though brown nosers were definitely treated better by management. The hardest part was never getting recognized for all the hard work we did."
good,"I worked REALLY hard for this company, and they turn around and shut down the entire department pretty much over night. Oh, and this was right after the company's anniversary party for the department! One of the VP's came down and made this big huge speech about how every department is needed to make the engine work blah blah blah. . . whatever"
good,typical day is to help customers. Learned a lot about home improvement. Management was horrible. Co-workers were all very nice. Hardest part of the day was returns due to the rude customers. Most enjoyable was the co-workers.
good,"The new CEO screwed everything up so I left. Its not that I don't appreciate running plumbing, electrical and the appliance dept all at once in the biggest store in our district but it was a little much to have 16 customers looking at you, three phones to answer and no help.."
good,nobody really came into the store.
good,"Working with the variety of people at the Home Depot, I've learned how to handle adversity, cultural, and language barriers to make the best of the situations. The hours and schedules are terrible and there really is no break. The most an Associate is away from the store is 28 hours."
good,"A systematic dismantling of a high performance team will result in the untimely loss of market share to competitors, based solely on the deterioration of physical customer facing elements of the Home Depot organization."
good,Don't look for a career with this company. Decisions are driven by profitability and opportunities to become financially secure are very limited. It is a nice part time job for a student or a second income for a spouse or retiree.
good,"providing excellent customer service, management direction changing daily and lack of communication,"
good,: Consistently provided
good,"By far the best part about working at The Home Depot is learning about Home Improvement and helping customers to improve their own homes. Beyond the service environment, the work itself is grinding and literally thankless. The physical stress alone is unhealthy for Supervisor and ASM positions, and the job will definitely cost your marriage and your self-respect. I cannot recommend the Home Depot to anyone who does not hire in at Store Manager or above, or conversely, part time."
good,A typical day at work is largely based on helping customers throughout the store obtain what they need to complete a project. Very learning based work environment where skills can be obtained across a variety of departments.
good,In December the place could be a ghost town but in spring a thriving bee hive of activity. This of course was the time of inventory on top of the high traffic.
good,"Okay place to work. Good hours, nice employees, but not room for advancement."
good,"Excellent company to work for if you're innovative and have an entrepreneurship mindset. With that said, there is a lack of internal company and in store structure with decision making done without clear reason and purpose."
good,I got experience working with people face to face. How to multi-task and how to communicate concerns to management..
good,One of the best company to work for. Treat their employees with respect. Good pay and great benefits.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at the Home Depot is the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people. A typical day at work consist of getting right to work with assisting customers and helping associates when needed.
good,"from 4am to 8am, lots of merchandise to moved down. learning every day about new merchandise, expecting work full time but they allowdme only part time."
good,"Long hours, great co-workers and unstable management. The most enjoyable part of my job was the compliments I received from my co-workers and customers."
good,"Schedule always changes, don't treat everyone equal, don't pay everyone equal, good ol boy system, expected to do it all. Average bennies."
good,Great company for younger people with an open schedule and minimal bills at the entry level
good,they treat you like a apron on the floor and will not work with you if you are going to school
good,"A typical day at home depot is very busy, no time to stand around, learned SO much about Electrical And Lighting and everything that goes with it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some harassment by customers. The most enjoyable part was helping someone fix something they loved, and didn't want to ""replace""."
good,"My work day is a normal day for me. I have learn a lot from home depots department, just as the plumbing, hardward, paint, an the products they have. Management could be better. Some of my co-workers are not much of hard workers. The hardest part of my job is trying to set the shelf the way the planogram is set. I try not to make my job hard."
good,Temporary employment while completing studies.
good,want to much from the people with sales per hr. in a bad market
good,the company is getting better. lthere is a lot of growth potential. busy.
good,"Working with every type of customer you can imagine is fun filled experience!! You learn something new everyday and you can relate to most things. As far as the management, the management is horrible. They treat you as if your in grade school and the lines of communication is ridiculous. 1111 East ridge road can definetly use a New store Manager, all 3 ASM's need to be replaced and HR never does her job correctly."
good,"Walk your depts, order product, give direction to Department Managers, get buy in.Make sure everyone one is engaged. Focus:Customer Service, Store Standards, and Appearance. Oversee P@L, First Aid, Health and Safety. Oversee Shrink, markdowns etc, Maintain building and equipment, Motivate, coach, train and develop associates. Pay bills and order supplies. Main focus sales on the floor. Great Assist Managers, Dept Managers and associates. Hardest part of the job is trying to get a balance between work and home. Best part of day is engagement with customers and staff."
good,"Most co-workers are nice, a few are very quiet. Management is fairly inconsistent with several 'pets' that receive special treatment."
good,Just work hard give it a 100% each day so that the customer and company are happy.
good,"Even as a lot associate (employee), the inside departments can be learned by taking PK (Product Knowledge) Courses, so you know the specifics of what you sell, to help you sell to the customer better. You can be used in a variety of ways, not just on the parking lot. You could be asked to cut wood, but always measure twice, cut once. You could pass out survey pamphlets to the customers whom you are loading their vehicles for. Be careful loading drywall and water heaters. Advancement opportunities aren't too swift, but the education is great. I don't know if it was extreme pressure upon the Store Manager of Home Depot at the time, but I was brow-beat intensely by him for some unknown reason. If you're not happy with the type of trade at the Home Depot, it might be wise to move on."
good,poor compensation
good,"I was an appliance sales specialist. I would come to work, review sales material, and clean appliances. Most days we were under staffed and I had to help customers all over the store because I was not usually busy with customers in my area. But we all worked together and helped each other."
good,"Home Depot has a lot of potential to be a great job, but unfortunately there is a lack of connection between management and those who are hired to work on the sales floor. When I was hired I had previous management experience and full-time availability but was given a part-time cashiering job for just over minimum wage. Management was inconsistent, as were Department Heads."
good,Everyday I learned something new. Whether it would be home improvement or management/operations of big box company. Not a bad company to work for.
good,"Easy work, no leadership and room for growth was slim due to working on a contracted project. The company was great."
good,enjoyed them as an employer while i work there although i did realize shady stuff that went on overworked under paid type of work.
good,"Great pay, if you started 6+ years ago. Management manages for their bonus, not to help employees or improve company."
good,Workplace would be better with a different management group. Found many managers are concerned more about their schedule than other employees schedule conflicts. Needs more promotion within toward management and supervisory positions. Great employees and lack of training.
good,management does not know what they are doing but pushing to get it done...
good,"Thought the employees are the greatest part at working at The Home Depot, it was hard to keep a positive work enviroment because the upper management did not keep a positive, efficent, and fun work enviroment. People would work extremely hard and would barely get a ""good job"" from management."
good,at home depot you would work on providing customer service and helping people find what they are looking for while listening and coming up with solutions to their problems
good,"job is easy. the workplace culture is OK management is, well management, that need to realize that we are a team. customer interaction is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Driving 3000 miles a month.  No mileage allowed,  and no gas reimbursement. 70 or more hours per week.  Very large sales territory,  which was caused by attrition,  and a hiring freeze."
good,Over all it’s a good place to work.  People can tend to be clicking but it’s not Crazy bad. Lots of weekends. As pt lots of 4hr shifts. Policies are very easy to follow.
good,Takes way too long to advance with this company. I was there for 3 years and wasn’t offered full time status until it put my two week notice in. No valid reason was explained as to why. I was the best associate in the store
good,"Full time benefits are good but not great. If you can keep your supervisor happy and just do what they ask, then it's all good. Compensation is above average and they have a great program for employee assistance thru the Homer Fund in case of emergency or disaster, or just in need of assistance and this is thru employee contributions that are optional."
good,"Typical box store job, nothing special.  Machine operator license comes with no extra compensation and all the responsibilities.  Spent 80% of my time getting products available for customers, 10% helping customers and 10% taking phone calls.  "
good,"The company is very customer service oriented; whether you're working on the floor to working in management positions, every employee is required and expected to provide excellent customer service, no matter who asks."
good,"The Home Depot Store #3507 was a decent starting point for a young worker despite low pay & managerial changes, as well as conflicting directions & expectations."
good,Ive worked at the home depot for almost 5 years and while it is a good company to work for it depends on what store you go to some are good and some are bad
good,"Pay was terrible, i felt sorry for the single employees trying to make it on $11 per hour.  Always personality clashes and drama going on.  Store manager was useless and the operations manager was a jerk.  The managers and supervisors who worked hard were overlooked for promotion because the DM had his favorites.  The schedule was made out 3 weeks in advance so if you needed to make a doctor's appt, good luck trying to switch your scheduled day with someone.  Quarterly bonuses sucked for the worker bees, $50-75 at best.  Aldi pays more."
good,"Learnt a lot at this job about the product we worked with. Coworkers were all nice and friendly, and management was nice. Not a great pay rate, but it's an entry level job."
good,"This fast paced job with a  large work load but overall a friendly place to work. you must have ""tuff skin"" able to take positive and negative  criticism from fellow associates, management and customers."
good,"Hours cut when sales are slow, even on weekends. Short staff means unhappy customers/ fewer sales. Sales goals based on previous year. No consideration how current weather effects customer traffic."
good,"Depending on how the managers work things, you can have experience in one field and be hired for one area, but they expect you to cross train for everything.  They used to offer certification and training classes for each area, with a minor pay increase the more you knew about, but they no longer do that...they just expect you to know how to do everything for the same pay."
good,"Great place to work "
good,Had a decent time working there learned a lot while working there and different departments just would be nice if they were more accommodating to someone who was walking to work every day
good,They'll love you for a few months but that about it. After that they expect you to know every department and knowing how to do others jobs that your not even paid for. It's like they get a new puppy but expected the puppy to do more then just sit down and roll over. If it doesn't then they'll throw you to the side. Home depot is ok only good for a short time not a long time
good,Wasn’t a great company to work for! Company didn’t respect me having younger kids and them being sick (hospitalized) they wanted me to choose between they job and my child. The management sucks! They are all lazy and rude!
good,fast pace place to work. very easy to learn the material. very diverse and good place to start if you need a job. the customers at this location are very friendly and understanding.
good,"Overall fast paced and great environment. Store centrally located in Honolulu, very flexible with your needs. Family oriented and very interested in your development."
good,I unloaded trucks and stocked shelves and helped customers locate what they were looking for when no sales associates could be found in they're department
good,"Home depot is a good job for people choosing to be in a field they acquire; plumbing, electrical etc. I chose home depot because I was able to transfer locations and because it paid the bills. I do enjoy the paint department though."
good,The Home depot has good benefits if you are a full time employee.  Management was decent and very set on customer satisfaction at my store specifically.
good,"I was a head cashier, but often got pulled to other departments such as the service desk or pro desk to help out when lines got long or when we were short staffed, which was quite frequently. Management seemed to have been either missing in action or stretched too thin across the store to appropriately assist associates in need when called. The culture of this location seemed constantly stressed with overworked and under-payed employees. There are employees who do the bare minimum of their job to get by and never get disciplined & then you have the employees who go above and beyond their job description and get pulled up by management every few weeks. "
good,I've worked there for about 7 months and I have seen people leave as fast as they came in the managers are a coinflip a few are good a few not so much
good,"Inconsistent hours, and constantly changing schedule made this a difficult job for me. Others thrive in this environment I do not. The people I worked with made all the difference in my working there. There is a lot of turnover in the company."
good,Good time until you meet really terrible employees who like to gossip about others and complain to management telling them you do nothing when nobody has trained you in your department.  Overall everywhere else was amazing and some of the ASMs were amazing except for a couple.  If you find a good Home Depot the community can be amazing but if you have super negative and cruel people who talk behind your back when you have never done something. It makes you really sad and it hurts your rep as an employee and to sell for Home Depot.
good,Favoritism is seen in every department and especially in management. Only certain people get written up for things and others get rewarded for simply doing their job. If you're not an butt kisser you will not get ahead. People will rush to take credit for a job well done by someone else and this can get very annoying when it happens regularly. Toxic environment to work in.
good,HD is one of the largest retail companies in the world. Customers that go to HD expect a high level of service and product knowledge to help them solve their costruction needs.
good,"As a specialist, I am required to meet sales expectations without consideration of current trends, customer opportunities or compensation. In other words, I have to meet my quota even though home owners are tending to buy more hardwood/vinyl than carpeting, even though customer traffic is slow and even though I do not receive commission."
good,Don't really give you time off as a part time. I live with my parent so if they go on vacation I have to go and they denied my time. Not a great work/life balance.
good,"Work 12hrs daily  you can stay late if you want to,very intense working environment on the loading docks. 30 minute lunch break not very long two 20 minute breaks in between work at a fast pace during sometimes of the day"
good,It was one of those come in get done what needs to be done and leave type job. Just a paycheck really. The coworkers were pretty good sometimes the customers were difficult but that is like any sales associate job. All in all okay place to work.
good,"Pros 40hr/4day week, weekends off, staff"
good,"It is a good place to work, because the people that work there are really good people, including management. The only downside is that they don't pay enough for the amount of work they ask you to do."
good,Unloading and packing out all freight and to prepare store for opening by facing all products. Putting away any freight up into the overhead that will not pack out
good,"The Home Depot has conformed to the business model of most big box stores; paying less wages for non-experienced employees and cutting customer service staff to the bone. The corporation is management heavy and compartmentalizations has caused communications problems that translates to inefficient use of the company’s funds. Each branch of management continues to make poor decisions to perpetuate their jobs, while crunching numbers(metrics) and losing track of their number one priority; CUSTOMER SERVICE."
good,No stress involved. good training for working in the paint department and worked with good associates. People were friendly and cooperative with each other.  They did not mind helping if you needed it.
good,If you like a relaxed easy kind of job don’t work here but if you like having overbearing management customers that have no respect for you and unrealistic goals that management expects you to meet this is the place for you
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for if you are looking for short term work. It is hard to build a career in this company and hard work and dedication is not rewarded.
good,"great place to learn  and working environment                                                               "
good,"The time I spent working at Home Depot felt very chaotic and unguided. I can only speak for the store I worked at, but management was very fickle. I did not feel I received appropriate training for the position I was hired on for and that lead to a very stressful and worrisome work environment."
good,I loved my job at first and when management changed things changed. I was a very dedicated worker never missed a day of work never took a vacation day and even went in on my off days and was terminated for a safety violation. I felt it should've been a coaching or write up but hey it was my first job.
good,Poor leadership skills in management. Because of this low moral and lack of associates being motivated and/or accepting responsibility for their work.
good,"The Home Depot can be a stressful job at times. I worked in the kitchen and bathroom department, you had to quite knowledgeable with the inventory because customers always needed help making the right purchase. I also did a lot heavy lifting and organizing of inventory."
good,i was pigeon holed. i was unable to move to other departments in the store and my transfer to another location was stopped due to my need at my job...
good,Standard review   Had the incorrect pronoun more than once  I don’t believe the manager had a thorough understanding of what I actually did   I went above and beyond but wasn’t recognized for it
good,Management had too large a territory to really do anything outside customer service. Rules were constantly changing making it very difficult to function. Training was sub par or lacking entirely making everything learned on job when you were expected to already be an expert.
good,"I work here as a student in college. Management offers flexible scheduling, and does their best to maintain a safe and pleasant environment. Would recommend to others in school."
good,you can move up in the company and the pay incresses are endless if you want to put the work in i like a place that as long as you work hard they will move you up in the company
good,Definitely has flexibility in working hours and many job positions available. Sometimes areas are stretched thin and it reflects on the store as a whole.
good,"Management is awful, since there are favorites who never have to work. This causes a lot of extra work on the other employees and is unfair. Otherwise it's a fine place to work at, but could definitely use some cleaning up on who's in charge and what people cat get away with."
good,"Dirty work environment, bad hours and inconsistent work flows. Welcoming work environment and friendly staff, easy but long interview and hiring process."
good,"I think its not a bad job to work, but also not the greatest job. Some days can be tough some can be hard. The type of work is done at the home depot; i feel as though they can pay more."
good,"Poorly managed. You won’t get hours unless you’re full time. They don’t care about your availability. "
good,The Home Depot is all about customer service and knowledgeable associates.  The problem lies with Corporate ideas that limit the amount of associates in the stores therefore creating a high turnover.  The result is hiring younger kids that have no knowledge and overwhelming the tenured associates causing everyone to always be ready to leave as soon as a better offer comes up.  The Managament disconnect from what needs to be done or even how to do basic things that go on everyday is appalling.  I do however enjoy helping customers solve problems they are facing and giving them advice on their projects
good,"The hob was ok as part time, for me. They do offer benefits for oart time too. There are issues with management at times. You can balance work and home life. Pay needs to be better. As a starter job it is a good job."
good,"Home depot as company is great to work for. However the local home depot is a complete mess, there is unfair pay between men and woman and a double standard on performance as well. Understaffed, and associates are overworked for little to no recognition."
good,"I didn't like how the customers treated me. I felt like the store didn't want me to have a life outside of work. I fell off my diet, lost tremendous amounts of sleep, and could never get a full time position."
good,"I was an sales associate in a store in Ohio, very low on the totem pole. As soon as I showed ambition by expressing an interest in a vacant position in the Corporate Communications Office at Corporate HQ in Atlanta (I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Professional Writing and Editing), my store management team treated me like I had a bullseye on my back."
good,It was a very busy work environment and fast paced. Best tip I can give is to make sure you know all of the departments very well to ask them for barcode information
good,"it depends on which department you are going into because it could get quite overwhelming working at home depot, especially being at the service desk."
good,You really need a background in at least general handiness to help customers with their variety of problems . At the time seemed a little low on the pay scale for the demand that was placed on employees but this may have changed. Overall good employees that are willing to go out of their way to help fellow employees
good,"My time at HD I felt was wasted. I was hired for one position then placed in two other departments to work and learn while being   “trained” for the position I interviewed for. "
good,"I Did not work  AT the Retail store...I did commercial, Sales, service. I had little contact with other employees, other than once a year meeting, and Tel calls."
good,"My specific store had great pay due to high sales. Almost no new hires in my time there aside from cashiers despite all departments badly needing associates. Positions that were hired internally were decided before interviews even began, but they still let associates interview for these spots."
good,"Not too bAd but not so good the supervisor unfair at all but the management did solve it ,"
good,"The schedule is so awkward.There’s no way being a part time you can find decent second job.There’s no holidays,you have to work the day before ,same day and after the holiday so that you can get pay for it.You don’t get any discounts for being an associate.And the salary for bilingual is the same as the rest of the associate,no matter what department or rank."
good,Easy job but comes with a lot of negative people depending on the role you have. Working in a specific department is preferred and better for those who just want to work hard.
good,Management is horrible. And they only hire Caucasian for supervisor positions at the Champaign store. Rather then the one who has more experience. And the pay is ridiculously low for the amount of difficult situations that employees have to deal with.
good,Good place to work all a rond must be very custmer servis driven pepol are nice to work with manachment pritty anderstanding now your job do it welll ok
good,Worked there for three years was pregnant my second year there and I got treated fairly badly they complained about me having a chair and me having to have frequent breaks not so much fans to pregnant women management has their favorites so whoever they like gets to do less work even if it’s a supervisor
good,"As a single mother I wish full time position was flexible with the hours during the school days when you have two kids in school. Great company to work for, I love everyone I work with, however it’s unfortunate how the company runs by certain of hours, and almost as if they expect you to work like if you don’t have a personal life. It’s very mind draining and unrealistic for a way to live and work or even grow with the company."
good,The job is horrible the managers honestly suck except for one. Whenever we needed help and went to the other managers they either didn’t know or will tell us to call another store to ask them. The customers are mostly rude and the managers never have our back. They make the schedule horribly with no coverage and then expect us to figure out whose going to cover whose break
good,Coworkers made work more inviting. Everyone was helpful right away and continued to be through my experience. Great staff. Only downer is during school season I was able to work 30 hours a week and was only scheduled  between 16-10 hours a week. Being a college student I needed consistent hours to afford everyday essentials. After asking for more hours they said there were no hours to give. They are more focused on full time workers than part time workers. Great job if you only want a couple hours during the week/weekend.
good,Home Depot is a good Company. The benefits are decent and the pay isn't too bad. Hours are pretty good because they don't stay open too late. Certain departments are easier than others but they offer training to learn other areas of the store.
good,its hard to feel secure here. there is always some one trying to pull one over on you. they want you to do a job without the tools required or the personal. its hard to do a 10 man job by yourself.
good,"You can be hired for almost any department that has a need for additional seasonal help if you have good customer service skills, are willing to go the extra mile,  and are a team player."
good,Plan to work your tail off from the minute you get there til you leave. Also plan on getting your hours cut to next to nothing. You work like a mad man but get little to no recognition for your efforts.
good,Home Depot was ah okay job for someone out of high school but as time went on I wasn’t getting any raises and it was hard to maintain focus for the job because of the lack of pay
good,I do like the job but pay isn’t enough. I’m part time so hours can vary from 12-28 hours. Not worth it. Management really sucks. Lots of favoritism. I would recommend if you wanna stay for a few months.
good,Typical Retail. Over worked managers and under staffed stores. Pay is good but lacks security on positions. I preferred being a designer over management.
good,have to be very independent to work here. management needs to learn how to support there crew a lot better in some of the areas. great people to work with that makes it fun.
good,"es una empresa grande con mucha variedad en productos de venta para construccion, remodelacion de una casa, etc. esta todo debidamente clasificado y organizado por tipo de material y cuenta con una cantidad de personal para atender requerimientos de los clientes."
good,This job is to learn on your own and willing to network around to learn other opportunities. The work place environment is to advance with people who want you advance.
good,"It’s mostly Part time not a lot of Full time positions. No employee discount. Managers are nice. High Tech touch screen registers. Some customers can be harsh, cruel and irate. Can be difficult to bite your tongue"
good,"Working at Home Depot, I was able to get over my fear of driving a forklift. I actually came to enjoy driving them when the need came up. Occassionally Managment at Corporate level would come in and put on a barbecue for the employees when we had a good stretch of time with no preventable accidents. That was always nice."
good,"Always something new and interesting to learn!  The merchandise categories are vast and the differences in customer expectations are extremely varied ... which leads to a great amount of learning each and everyday. Overall the people are great! The company has an honorable list of values to guide decision making. These values are lived by most within the organization, but occasionally some upper management do not follow the stated values."
good,job is great when there is coverage and help in the store. Can be fast pace when the store get busy during the day with contractors and customers placing orders.
good,Fun working with customers.Enjoyed working with employees and the company always given out rewards to employees.friendly work place to work. Some of the managers are very good with helping out around the store.
good,"I had a great time at Home Depot, I started as a cashier and within a year I was cross trained to 5 or so different positions. "
good,"I started out as a cashier, once they found out I was good at locksmithing I was promoted to the hardware department. It's an interesting place to work, provided you still live at home with your parents. because there is no way you can live on your own with what they pay you and raises are rare and paultry. But my biggest gripe of all is that there is no incentive for obtaining extra skills or licenses. They have a product knowledge test for all 12 departments which includes testing and a sign off by the department heads. and yet by learning and improving there is zero incentive to do it and it also adds to your duties and responsibilities."
good,Management didn’t communicate well. I liked working at the service desk because I worked directly with customers and it was a fast paced work environment. The pay wasn’t great for the job we did. There wasn’t slot of recognition or appreciation for hard work done.
good,An ok place to work. Can be a bit dreary at times especially when no ones in store. Not enough pay although. Seems as if hours are not enough even if you work alot.
good,I recommend you work for a less stressful and more adult driven company. One that cares how customers/employees are treated. One that listens to your needs and helps take care of them.
good,It is a very multi-cultural company and very diverse but there is a lot of favoritism that is not always fair
good,they love to pride themselves on being an orange family but it's a very dysfunctional family. Management worked you near to death regardless if your sick or dying and the coworkers were all for themselves and complained 80% of the time.
good,"Somewhat unorganized, very casual environment, very friendly associates, too understaffed at times and overstaffed at others, spent way too much time cleaning up after/fixing problems that other associates caused."
good,"At the Home Depot, the more senior employees supported new and more younger employees.  However, the hiring was a revolving door and younger employees didn't last for over a year."
good,"A typical day on the sales floor keeps you very busy. Between constant customer services requirements and management directed store preparation, there is rarely any opportunity for rest. This fast paced environment may suit some people well but from my experience the result is constant stress and overwork on the part of a small group of employees to the point that many leave quickly after employment. The camaraderie between the associates is easily the best part of the job and the hardest is definitely that being a good employee sets you up to be over-relied upon as was my situation as well as several others."
good,Company pushes for great work/life balance but comes up short. District level management is disengaged from stores. District management team more concerned about their advancement in the company instead of cultivating store growth from with in.
good,"I provide customer service, including directing customers to products, answering questions about goods, or assisting in purchase decisions. "
good,"I admire a company that hires from within, but HD tends to hire unqualified candidates for jobs based solely on seniority/longevity. This result in poorly run departments run by individuals with no credentials to lead or manage people. Home Depot offers training, but it's often by the same untrained and unskilled ""veterans""."
good,Nothing to say. I learned a lot while I was working there but the people tended to get aggravating and not wanting to work. No true teamwork. Always a problem with management showing favoritism.
good,The head store manager has no people skills and is unpleasant to work with.  The work load is very high and the job is stressful.  Half of the department managers are ungrateful for what you do.
good,"Favourites on Favourites, as a student, this job is managebale, ut the workplace is very gossip-y and have no respect of private life as they are all middle aged people with nothis else to do."
good,It was a good place to work at because of the coworkers but management sometimes contradict themselves. Also some customers felt entitled and would be rude.
good,"While working at the Home Depot, a lot of the time responsibilities are shifted back and forth because of a lack of determination and good work ethic between employees throughout the store."
good,"It don't really appreciate the good people that they have, they hire people who don't know anyting about the department and that's very frustrating. There are a lot of people that work there and quite a few that don't really do anything  and try to look busy"
good,"I loved the job, but man you would be work 20 years before you ever see 20hr. I use to do everything from loading trees to bringing refrigerators into 3rd floor buildings. 1yr later, I’m offered automatic raise into my pay of 20cents. Good schedule i had but I couldn’t survive for 10.20hr. Medical alone was offered $180 per check. I wouldn’t recommend this place for adults with children and illnesses."
good,"I currently work at Home Depot as a closing associate in the paint department. It is my responsibility to complete all closing duties on a daily basis for the department in addition to customer sales and service. I learned the position quickly after it being offered 14 months ago. I became their ""go-to-guy"" to solve unique problems and train new employees. I’m used hard work, I work 2 thru 4 pallets a day, pulling them off the racking while practicing the Home Depot S.O.P. as well as high safety standards. I work those pallets into our stock, consolidate overstock onto a single pallet, inventory it, log it and fly it back into the racking."
good,"The culture was good; however, management was erratic. It changed often, and young and inexperienced people were promoted before they were trained for the positions. Associates were often confused in their duties."
good,Company had a wide range of shift availability which was convenient but management seemed to be lacking with communication. Pay is also very low compared to other completion.
good,Every manager has their own way of handling situations which leads to disagreements in departments. The treat you like you do not have a life outside of the company.
good,"stressful"
good,it's was fun but it was a temporary job through a temp agency I wish it was long assignment I had fun working night shift with some amazing people who works  all over the world
good,"This place is a great a great place to work at! especially if you are starting out, great for high school students and post high school, great environment and people!"
good,"I prefer a set schedule"
good,"GENERAL HOME DEPOT REVIEW:"
good,home depot was fun i wish i can go back good workers i really enjoyed working there i met new people and got new skills i was improving alone the way good job.
