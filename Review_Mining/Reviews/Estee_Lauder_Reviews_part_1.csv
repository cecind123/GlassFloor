rating,review
bad,I worked very hard for pod amazing but the manager constantly found everything wrong I felt so stressed between the managers negative remarks always getting bashed that it caused me to take a stress leave and I never returned due to me finding employment else where and I am happy in my work place and no stress now
bad,I would not recommend working with the Estée Lauder brand due to the fact that area management using techniques have people she dislikes to exit the business I witnessed this with one of my colleagues as a manager she was horrible to the person and had them in tears and to that she then left the business. Also if you think it’s going to be fun don't believe them they have no family friendly policies in place I used to work well over the excess of 60 hours and never got payed correctly ever
bad,"Unfortunately I’ve nothing to say all "
bad,If you want to be laughed at when you tell management about harassment... if you want to dread going to work everyday... if you want to sit back and watch the high school mentality and get backstabbed every two second over pettiness and sales... if you want to lower your self esteem... if you want the new management to make you feel like trash just by looking at you... then this is the place for you
bad,"Inadequate management -Training is very poorly planned - more time is spent providing Entertainment during the Christmas Period when you actually need support with comprehensive ongoing training - expect to be exhausted, stressed and emotional - a very pressurised environment with poor management strategy - understaffed and under-managed"
bad,This is by far the most unprofessional place I have ever worked. I received zero training on cash or the floor and was some how expected to work both at the same time because there’s never enough associates. There’s also way too many managers and it’s extremely difficult to learn when you have 8 different people telling you how to do the same thing a different way. Managers also like to sit in the back for most of their shifts and talk about personal stuff and then get mad when you disturb them and the amount of swearing managers do while in the work place is ugly. Honestly the problems here are endless and none of your hard work will be appreciated.
bad,"Job with very high stress levels "
bad,"Hours were cut back with little to no notice from 35h to 5 or 10."
bad,"Wow. Working for this company was a disaster. The management will steal sales, go over your head, and do whatever it takes to nitpick and get you fired. No room for individuality. Outdated. Ridiculous sales goals."
bad,"I worked for this company for 7 years. At first it was very good, but it has gone down hill very rapidly. The management are too young and inexperienced in the position to deal with and get the best out of the staff. They will offer you no support and they will favour the employees that are in their clique."
bad,Long working hours with very low pay!! Your treated like a number and expected to accept abuse from customers.  Very low pay . Also any racial undertones were always present but never dealt with. Promised rewards but never recieved them. Horrible company to work for.
bad,"Build sales, make overs, dollar goals, go to various department stores, no micromanagement ans something if the manager is generous you can get good samples"
bad,"Don't recommend to anyone."
bad,"Slow work, spent majority of the day standing around"
bad,"Poorly managed. Narcissistic.  Reactive. Zero communication. Outsourcing to outside U.S. at every angle. The most common question among employees is “who is making these decisions...”?!!  Seriously, run do not walk... away from this company. They say they have great benefits but as a contractor (3+ years) I did not see any in my experience."
bad,"I was hired as a retail manager for a high volume store, the training provided was by my assistant manager - who was disheartened and had not been managed for over a year. I was not properly trained due to this and despite the communication to my MRO she was still upset I did not know things and was to manage out the manager who was training me."
bad,"terrible manager, lack of team environment, selfish and nobody ever takes accountability. they just like to abuse people. please do not work here; this place will dry to out."
bad,"The job was fairly easy and the hours were great but unfortunately, it was the kind of job that called you when they needed you. The pay was bad, nobody can survive on the pay rate at all."
bad,"full of dummy "
bad,"Worked in the maintenance department. Maintenance department wasn't bad overall. but they pay one person on maintenance as a ""millwright"" and the others as ""maintenance technicians"". the maintenance techs report to production supervisors. Some production supervisors were pretty good, some were completely useless. but if a production supervisor does not like you for whatever reason, could be the way you look, your gone. They did pay good and provided apprenticeships which is a good thing if your starting out as an apprentice. you wont learn to much about general millwright practices, just set-up and changeovers, mainly pneumatics troubleshooting but that's it. They have lathes, milling machines, and a welding set up, but if you spend to much time fabricating you will get in trouble for being off the line too long, even though you a making a part/repair for the machine. Even if the line is running and you leave to make a repair or even grab a tool you will get in trouble. Only the ""millwrights"" can perform certain maintenance procedures. the ""maintenance techs"" are more set-up/glorified operator/part changer. During my time, they promoted a line worker to a production supervisor and that supervisor told me how long it  should take to fix the machine because and line worker knows better than a millwright. when i needed to get parts (which were completely disorganized) i would get in trouble for leaving the line for too long, when i had to fix the machine. operators were pretty useless, could not even clear jams or stop machines if they needed to. I never even got locks to lockout"
bad,"Toxic work environment. This place is a cesspool....It's a culture of nepotism and bigotry. Working hard will not get you ahead in the consumer care department. Those who sleep all day, harass subordinates and make inappropriate/racist comments get promoted. I wouldn't recommend this place if it were the last job on the face of the earth. The managers act like plantation masters"
bad,Management does not train!! Very unhappy atmosphere!! Would not recommend this job to anyone no matter how desperate you are for work! You will never hear a positive word in this store!
bad,management is horrible and disrespectful. Has no problem yelling and belittling you in front of co-workers or customers. When hired I was also told that I would never have to work past 11pm because I could not work after that time and found that quite often I was scheduled until midnight or 2am during inventory which I was also not told about during the hiring process.
bad,"A typical day at work is much like that of a robot. Although we take calls for 30 different brands, little product training is provided. Management is one big clique. A recently promoted manager has a history with human resources for making racist comments."
bad,The company as a whole was great to work for. The management is horrible. They do not care about their employees. They treat them very poorly. I would not work for this company ever again.
bad,horrible awful warehouse job if there is no work you have to pretend like your working or they send you home
bad,Mangers suck at there job. Often lie about everything and get you fired for anything. And lie to H.R. it's just a back stabbing place to work who don't care about you.
bad,"Not much communication between the brand and you at the dept store. Had to make up for their errors as far as advertisements, shortages, and lack of stock. Huge targets (20-25% increases over the prior years) were expected, very high pressured job with little pay, minimum wage.. for a skilled service job. Basically be prepared to train yourself and work with people who do not care about make up or skincare."
bad,"I had the  WORST experience of my career history to work in Estee Lauder Canada, I am so disappointed about their poor management, poor knowledge about science and claiming they are working in GMP environment????"
bad,"The worst paying job I have ever held. I moved our team from No.6 to No.1 in sales for our district. I never received the bonus promised and since I was salary...my hours averaged 50-55 a week making only 29k annually."
bad,A typical day at work is working on an assembly line checking inspecting and dis-guarding unwanted goods for production. I have learn how to work in a fast pace environment and filling out paper work. management and co-workers are good to work with but there isn't much time to socialize on the job. The hardest part is getting along with everyone and the most enjoyable part is meeting new people
bad,"If you are looking for unattainable goals, a million focuses, poor leadership, no growth opportunities, no work life balance, extremely high expectations, and constant short staffing, then this company is for you."
bad,"Not a company to work for:"
bad,I was pregnant while working for them and had to stand throughout my whole shift.  They were not very considerate of situation. The manager was very demanding. Her expectations were not realistic.
bad,"Store Manager."
bad,"Worked for BECCA in the UK. Area managers are only sweet while you are in the busy Christmas period and making them money. The north area manager in the UK has been putting too much pressure on staff and forcing them to quit. They never listen to feedback and think only their opinion is right. They talk down to you like you are worthless. It’s purely about making money for them and what benefits the business, not staff."
bad,"Management couldn't care less. You cannot take your uniform home. Security will check to make sure as you exit. 5 weeks and I still haven't received a locker. Took almost a month to get mandatory forklift training. Took 5 weeks to get my own login/password for WMS. Temporary employees hate permanent employees and will work to sabotage and undermine permanent employees, especially if you are a new permanent employee. You will be surrounded by dozens of temporary employees who have been working there for YEARS with no benefits. Permanent employees hate the new employees because the new employees are given shifts that reduce the available over time (hence the Wednesday to Sunday shift). Jobs that are posted are not available when you interview. Serious lack of communication in management. They will send you out for training and when you arrive for training the trainers will send you home because management failed to confirm the appointment. 30 min lunch break and one 15 minute break, but it takes 5-10 minutes to walk through the facility. Avoid job offerings for the Melville plant. You will regret it."
bad,"All talk and no show. Poorly run.  MAC is going down hill - worse place to work and so is the entire company Estée Lauder.  "
bad,"La fonction du poste me plaisait beaucoup."
bad,Good place to work with talented artists. We were always paid and compensated very well from our bosses. If you like making your own hours and traveling to different venues then this job is amazing.
bad,"they never have stock , false promises , staffing is a problem and commutcation is too.  they dont care about the lower managemnt . to many meetings and phone calls"
bad,too stressful of a work environment. no real room for advancement. djfskjdfhskdjfhskdjfhs odjkfhskjdfhskljdfhsdjfhsjdfhskjdfhksjdfh
bad,"no comment"
bad,"HR needs to have someone evaluate what management of AR is not doing.  They BS all day and stress out the employees but allow their friend who works in the dept. come and go as they please.  Also, Exec. Director too busy making friends with the young people on facebook to include hanging out...  There you go advancement....PAY ATTENTION TO THE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE WORKED THERE FOREVER AND ARE TREATED NOT SO WELL.  Hmmm could that be because they aren't in their 20's sounds like an issue."
bad,Connu internationalement et un très beau panel de marques
bad,"No team feeling. No camaraderie. Everyone just does their work, and doesn’t socialize AT ALL. "
bad,"Management is the worst. Unless you are an executive you have no advantages in this company. If you are lucky and have a good Manager who wants you to succeed then you are in a bad way. HR is the pits, the absolute worst ever, particularly if you are a person of color they are not not helpful, again unless you are an executive at the company. No job security- they don’t care about how long you have been working there. Management will stab you in the back in a heartbeat. "
bad,"Extremely racist company. If you are a person of color they will compensate you far less than your white counterparts for doing the SAME job, or even more. All politics, terrible management even in high positions like Directors and Regional managers. STAY AWAY (especiallynif you are a person of color)!!!"
bad,Advancement opportunities are nonexistent except for management.  Management has no clue on how to develop or retain good workers.  Supervisors will lie about employees just to get promotions for themselves.
bad,"The particular facility that I worked at had both permanent and temporary employees working together, doing the same job. The temporary employees did 90% of the work and the permanent employees played games on their phones and computer. Permanent employee's often ate within the lab."
bad,I gained alot from work here I gained different skills and a better understanding of the factory work enviroment. A typical day at work involved different asspects of the process from start to finnish of each different product provided by this company. My co-workers ranged in age and skill sets.
bad,"The Leicester store specifically. "
bad,Very unprofessional. no care for their staff or safety. i was employed for 3 weeks in which i saw people dismissed on a daily basis for no real reason or explanation
bad,High expectations from top to bottom. Only cares about numbers. No work life balance. Poor training. Not a lot of incentives. They need to sit down and figure out why they have high turn overs
bad,They have unhelpful and unprofessional managers and talked to Human Resources they didn't do much so I resigned because of the stress the manager inflicted
bad,Estée Lauder Companies is a cosmetic company. I really liked the working environment. There is a real opportunity to grow and to increase but it is not very challenging.
bad,"The job itself was easy and fellow co-workers are nice. The majority are asian being from India, Pakistan, China and Philippines. The disadvantage to this place is that temporary employees are like slaves that are put on a two year with very little opportunity to secure a permanent full-time job. I know a lady who worked here for six years doing two year contracts with a one year layoff in between contracts and was never hired. Her manager wanted to hire her, but the Senior Manager never wanted to hire. This sort of practice is just shameful. The pay is low, with very little ability to secure a full-time permanent job as they don't want to hire and pay benefits."
bad,"Want to work for a fun, hardworking, sociable team? "
bad,"This is the place for you.....the only good thing about Lauder....was the shift people i worked with....Outside of that......the equipment is old and out dated, spend half the night looking for what was needed to help complete a job....they hire new employees and after a few weeks...have them train even newer employees. The production floor is all temps....who are rude and dress like they just woke up outta bed. Id be embarrassed taking potential customers on a tour of this facility....bottom line....its all about share holders and making them padded pockets....You....a disposable item!!!"

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

bad,"No te dejan parar casi ni para ir al baño, nada de compañerismo, te controlan todo tiempo en el baño,  tiempo de salida de llegada..."
bad,"Estee Lauder doesn't treat their employees well, and does not pay well for the work that you are expected to do. It's not a good company to work for and products are overpriced!!"
bad,"I clean, service customers in every dept of store"
bad,"A typical day for work from 9-530 official, but normally it will off at 8/9pm, very long working hours."
bad,"No work life balance, everything seems great in the beginning. This company is all about who you know what you know. Horrible outdated benefits, HR will not have the answers for you. Account executives always have stuck up dry too good for you attitudes."
bad,"Tem visão, missão e valores incríveis.  Mas a prática é diferente. A operação brasileira é deficiente e decepciona.  Alta rotatividade de pessoas.  As qualificações são pouco importantes.  O que vale é o relacionamento."
bad,Not very good to the employees.  Never knew when you were going to work or not. You had to call in.  Or when you got there if you were going to stay a whole day.
bad,"After six years and countless attempts to move up in this company, I have decided it’s time for us to part ways.  Internal interview process moves at a glacial pace.  Management continues to make bad decisions and pulls talent from outside rather than from within."
bad,"At the company they don’t let you grow only the people they want. If you work thru the agency the company’s employees treat you like you're nobody because you don't belong to the company. The agency’s employees has to do the hard work while the’re employees are walking, chilling, yoking the agency's employees are not allowed not even to talk, and to me that’s not fear because we do the hard work. All parties they do it's only for Estee Lauder employees only. They segregated people that's a bad feeling."
bad,"ELC has such amazing brands; however my experience at Aveda was disorganized, non-innovative, reactive, and non-collaborative. Communication internally and externally was late and often inaccurate. There was one issue after another and feedback was rarely sought out from the field to help improve the business state. I had hoped to retire with ELC but I can’t imagine another 20 years there. It’s quite disheartening."
bad,"I can only speak for the Aveda division in Estee. The Aveda team id overworked. There is no focus on your work-life balance. The regionals are very political.. you will only move forward (and not far) unless your on their good list. Also, Job security is always a concern. With the state of the Aveda business, you never know what will happen."
bad,I have worked in cosmetics for this company for a long time and I can say it’s changed. They don’t care about makeup anymore just about you selling and pushing products. Only reward is discount! You can be the best and get nothing not even a thank you. Has made me fall completely out of love for something that I was very passionate about. Obviously feeling the pressure due to their being a lot more competition out there now.
bad,"Very dangerous work environment, management constantly lied to workers, machines constantly break down"
bad,"This position can be very rewarding for those who are more business oriented. It requires a lot of event coordinating, cold calling and business planning. With Estee Lauder being one of the largest gift with purchase lines, along with numerous product launches, there is always an event to book for. . "
bad,its good place to work and get experience but very long waiting to get hire .people and management are good to work with them but less opportunities to grow.work place is safe and lots of safety program running in the company.
bad,Doesn't get more cutthroat than that place. A million women stabbing each other in the back. Luckily I survived and made the best out of an interesting situation.
bad,After 20+ years the company is going in a direction which makes it hard to get up and go to everyday.  They have moved away from a culture that invests and values employees.
bad,"My most enjoyable part of my job was speaking with employees and being able to help them.Benefits were not so great, not too much job security."
bad,"Had a very bad management experience. My manager didn't believe in me, nor gave me the chance to be independent. "
bad,"While I learned a lot about the cosmetic & fragrance industry during my tenure at the Estee Lauder Companies, I became very burnt out and unmotivated at the end of my time there.  It was a 24/7 job that did not leave much time for anything else.  Upper management was lacking interpersonal skills and at times were very demeaning to employees.  This is not a place that is good at developing employees."
bad,Bin nicht zufrieden mit der Geschäftsleistung und mit dem Umgang den die Vorgesetzten gegenüber den Angestellten haben.
bad,"I was not happy with my team as they were not professional. The manager did not seem to be prepared for her position. Subsequently, the company chiefly focused on sales and achieving daily targets. Therefore, they did not care about internal problems. Since sales was the main target of the company, the team was under constant pressure, leading to unhealthy competition between the team members. The only joyful and beneficial experience during my time in Estee Lauder was the training we had for new products."
bad,it is ok. Looking for other options. Want more use of the talent that I have. A lot of overtime that is mandatory for supervisors and upper management
bad,"sauberer Arbeitsplatz, nette Kollegen, flexible arbeitszeiten"
bad,"Success is more about the politics of the office and who you know than skill. The company cares very little about employee growth and promotion outside of being an attractive employer and maintaining a good reputation in employer rankings. The salaries are on the low side in the industry. The benefits seem to balance it out, but it's hard to beat cash."
bad,"Dillards as a company was extremely stressful, but I always got my work done."
bad,"Stressful environment with poor leadership.  Requires more innovative processes.  Too many ""lifers"" within the company with not enough experience and most of them are managers.  It makes it difficult to grow and develop new skills to stay current."
bad,"A typical work day can be non-stop interesting, fun and fast paces work; or it can be terribly slow"
bad,"I enjoyed my job, I loved the customers, and my coworkers.  The hours were very difficult while trying to raise a family.  I learned a lot of great skills from the Estee Lauder Company.  They are a nice company to work for."
bad,I worked as a freelance makeup artist and they only cared if I sold.  You could of never done makeup before and they will hire you because at the end of the day they just want you to sell.
bad,the people i worked with were very rude. the management was very rude. the pay wasnt great and there was inconsistent hours along with it. i just had a bad experiance
bad,"Meeting and making a connection with the customers. I helped customers in their concerns to beauty and skin care. I did a counter goal as well as an individual goal. I am a certified makeup artist for Estee Lauder, in which appointments were made and makeup tutorials were done."
bad,"I'm sure every experience is different by territory. I was excited, hard working and motivated but my ""leader"", after promising help and support, promptly abandoned our counter. I have been a leader, and had many great ones and this was definitely the most disappointing experience. Minimal communication or support, high stress, tons of putting in your own hours and absolutely no thanks or appreciation or guidance."
bad,Estee Lauder as a company is a nice company to work for. They provide you with all training that you will need to be successful at your cosmetic counter. Be prepared for long hours and stressful situations during important Gift with purchase times. There is a level of excellence expected with the company.
bad,"Hard to cross over and work for other brands within the ELC portfolio of brands. Takes more than 2 months to interview."
bad,"Most jobs had been phased to temporary employees. They expect an extreme amount of work to be done and care little about you as an employee. If you did manage to get a full time position the benefits do not outway how little they pay. The 401k match is a joke because of this. Many of the managment were fresh out of college and do not care how things actually work, they just want it done or you are replaced."
bad,"Full-time is very exhausting, the hours are long and you are on your feet a lot. It is different now than when i worked there but i know they are very numbers driven and meeting sales goals are very important."
bad,"If you are working for a company for over 10 years you expect to keep your pay, when your show closes and they force you to take a position somewhere else that is now no longer equivalent to yours, not by any choices or actions you made, but because they refused to attempt to put you in one of the several open positions at other stores with open equivalent positions for some reason, that's never been explained. You're now treated like you know nothing and you know more than you're literal entire management team. It's disgusting how they treat you now that Estee bought out MAC, vile and sickening."
bad,"You are not valued as a good makeup artist it's all about sales. Poor management with no support. Only benefit is your discount. Work constant weekends and late nights so basically don't have a life. "
bad,"I would only recommend working here if you merely want to go in, do exactly as your told and collect a paycheck. You used to be able to not do that much work in many roles, however now everyone is under significant pressure to perform."
bad,The store was very dead most of the time. Not many customers so we had to constantly clean. We were not allowed good amount of breaks and were standing all day.
bad,"- peu de formation pour un poste"
bad,"l'ambiance est correcte."
bad,It wasn't salaried so the potential to make more was there. The hourly rate was 20 an hr which isn't bad.  I believe that should be on the lower end of the spectrum when dealing with a professional mua / manager who can do the work.
bad,Environment was not appealing to me personally. Slow paced environment. I prefer high energy. Interview process was exaggerated for the work I was expected to do.
bad,"This was a seasonal job. i had another job in the mall where esteem was located and they were extremely difficult with working with my schedule when I had explained in my interview clearly my priority was my first job. Eventually the season was over. But i would work seasonal or at all or esteem or companies like Macys , JC Penny etc"
bad,"Not something you want to do for the rest of you life. They pressure you a lot and if you happen to get injured at work, you get harassed and calling in sick is a big NO."
bad,I have been with the company for almost three years. This company does not offer room for advancement. On a positive note the work load is consider to be a work out; lifting heavy boxes and consistently standing on your feet.
bad,"Typical day at the job was being micromanaged by a VP that had no clue how to manage people.  Work was never correct in their eyes, your opinion didn't matter.  A very hierarchical structure where if you spoke to someone with out manager approval, you got questioned as to why,. If you did something that wasn't approved by your manager, you'd get spoken to.  If you tried to make process improvements they were never put into place.  Your ideas were taken and presented to upper management by others as their own.  Then you were told that you weren't doing your job.  Never encountered such a toxic environment, and hope to never again."
bad,The typical day is pretty slow and not enough productive work. I have learned very little while on this jon because it has not challenged me in any way. the management is ok. my co workers are ok as well. The hardest part about the job is that not everyone works as a team. The most enjoyable part is working with the customers
bad,"It's easy to get stuck in a corner with no recognition or career advancement if you are not paired with the right manager, not working in a good department, or lack exposure to senior leadership. "
bad,"Too liberal to the point where integrity and professionalism is completely lost. They dont promote the person who deserves it, they promote their favorites and friends. Heartless upper management. They care more about sales goals than the employees. You are literally just a number when you work for MAC A coworker had a family death and had to call out. She was told not to let it happen again. Disgusting experience."
bad,"I do not have much to say, but I do have a pro's and cons list."
bad,"Lots of experience, met good people. Needs more personal touch between management and teams."
bad,"constant phone calls to customers to the point of harassment. Ridiculous expectations, bad management, poor treatment of employees"
bad,"Great opportunity for growth in the beauty industry.  You will learn a lot about product knowledge and selling techniques as well as application.  Estée Lauder is also very generous with gratis, which they give to you, so you can provide the best costumer service"
bad,"I work with brilliant co-workers, I am a one woman counter, and work in an independent pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching every woman how to look and feel beautiful and giving  guidance and advice on skincare routines and make-up application."
bad,"Estee Lauder offers great benefits and employee support, but it is a very political arena.  Every division is run differently, but poor employment is tolerated by top management.  Also, poor management of certain divisions based on micromanaging senior management which has a trickle down affect on all employees--demotivating and frustrating."
bad,"Gehalt und Sozialleistungen gut."
bad,Doesn’t care anything about employees and room for advancement.  This company is so different from when I was in college vs this day and time.  Really don’t care about training in the field.  AE will visit for maybe 1 hr.  If your not young and bisexual - forget it!!!
bad,i worked here for a very brief period but had an ok experience. management had low standards for themselves and their employees but people were nice so overall good.
bad,Great and hospitable people to work with.  Well educated on the Oracle Micros X Store application and the backoffice functionalities.  Was able to learn about setting up store's MPOS via Ground Control.
bad,"Fast paced workplace, presented positive and negative challenges. Moral was typically low. The best times was when the counter was busy. I liked that we were able to play different types of music to help keep up an up beat momentum."
bad,I have only been with the Estee Lauder for a short time. The management is good and pleasant working environment. I have had good training on my job responsibilities.
bad,Estee Lauder is a good place to work although I am employed with them through Manpower agency and they really do not work for their people. I would like to work for a company that has advancement opportunities and long term employment.
bad,"Loved working with clients"
bad,Relaciones interpersonales que afectan el clima laboral
bad,"Excellent training is provided, wonderful perks also. All the brands under their umbrella seem to have a long career with the company as they are well looked after."
good,"Als Mitarbeiterin steht man den ganzen Tag rum ,darf Menschen ansprechen und die Stunden zählen bis Feierabend ist."
good,"at first it seemed okay then I realized my boss was never around and left us to figure out basic repairs, also basic repairs would take forever because tools were locked up and he had the key to security cages where the are kept."
good,"No management or HR support for growth of current employees.  "
good,"The products, depending on the brand, are usually good. The company is difficult to work with as it is very unrewarding. No one will congratulate you for your hard work, or compensate you for additional time invested off the sales floor"
good,"people at the job have learned to make the night go by faster by being comical as well as learning other fields of operation especially when a machine is in need of repair and your waiting on a mechanic to fix the problem this way nobody falls asleep on the lines ,, we also make up challenge game like name that tune while the music is playing"
good,My favorite part of the day was helping my clients with their skin care concerns- and making them feel beautiful.  I truly loved the girls I worked with- we were a family. Compensation was not up to par with the goals that were demanded.  Short on staff- no help from management.
good,"No tienen ninguna consideración a la hora de conciliar vida familiar y laboral. "
good,"-good way to learn how to service customers"
good,"Working at a beauty counter selling skincare, fragerance, and cosmetics."
good,most of the time stressfull because of the sales. But in busy time of the year its Good. Estee lauder does lot of promotions so you stay busy most of the time
good,I enjoyed working in the payroll department. My co workers were very friendly and helped me out alot when I first started. I learned something new everyday within my year at the company. Too bad it was only a temp job.  I would go back today if they needed me.
good,"Stressful, sometimes chaotic. Alot of changes to the way the brands are managed.  Different direction, constant changes and lack of clarity on what needs to be done."
good,"With so many people leaving everything is just really unorganized.. Schedules, hours, management, productivity, etc. At first I had consistent part time hours.. Now Im lucky to get 5hrs in a week."
good,"Pros: "
good,"Understand the Market and be willing to break the model. Have the same strategy would not work in an ever changing business landscape. Be willing to step outside the box,."
good,Empresa que valora de manera mediocre a sus empleados. El ambiente es bueno.
good,I love being in the environment where I get to constantly converse and meet new people. It's my job and duty to make that person feel comfortable as well as excited about our time together.
good,"Working for Dillards had its ups and downs like every job does."
good,"No Chance For Advancement"
good,"You could be asked to work a number of roles within the warehouse. I was tasked with packing boxes on a production line, which can get very repetitive as you generally are only allocated to one small section."
good,The life/work balance at EL was good but the management in the contact centre deteriorated over the 9 years I worked there. There was a lot of negative change and in the last few years I felt very much like a 'bum on a seat'
good,"A bit boring and not engaging job. The most of the time we had to deal with delays, silly technical problems and the laziness of the engineering department. The management always preferred a ""low profile"" line ending up with no actions taken in the most of the issues. Apparently a good work place but no real advancement opportunities...unless you were relative or in a relationship with a key role personnel. Totally absence of technical skills assessment."
good,"They are rude. They didn’t pay me properly for 10weeks but said they couldn’t do anything. Management are rubbish. You have a lot of foreign workers (polish) the management is polish so they get away with everything and I’m not joking. "
good,"Outras resposabilidades ""são esquecidas"" e terceiros são tratados como tal e não como parceiros."
good,"ELC sadly became more about presenting than substance. It became more about perception and being part of the ""click"". Things slowly deteriorated once shareholders became the driving force of the company."
good,Loved everything about this job just didn't have the best manager .Also it was hard to advance .You could hardly take vacation time off when you earned it
good,"Very busy place, they need more people for the volume of work. Good place to learn, then best to move on. The salary is not commensurate with the workload."
good,"I've worked for estee lauder for two years,,although the job is not hard and their is room for growths. its is severely hindered because of lack  of communication ,fraternization. I've learned a lot. I applied for may positions but didn't received cause of something so simple as not being let into the room to receive the application .It seems that who has the better convo gets the job. Favoritism  definitely plays a major part in whether u move how fast u move and where your placed.the hardest part of the job is THE SEPARATION...THE most enjoyable part of the job is that I get a pay check ever week. the level of mistakes that other people have to make up for should not happen ex..a person inspecting. they don't pull from the correct place they just apply the green dot, there is no way their logging for three hrs. and didn't noticed that there was no mf code. nothing is done but people being pulled to rework..there's no re  precautions..there are sum dedicated employee that have been there for a long time that make these mistakes that hinder production, there no  rotation people are put in same place to accommodates personal relations ..The comment box is a great idea but its in a place where everyone could see u put comments in,"
good,"The work life balance is pretty great here, but employee development opportunities are very limited and management is very disorganized"
good,"When you do not have any other job but want to start with something after landing in Canada as an immigrant, this is a good option without much expertise requirements."
good,"There are many benefits when working with the company, they do look after you for sure!!! Can be challenging at times when doing more of the sales work."
good,"Training is good at the HQ in London, but day to day life on counter as a Beauty Advisor is very monotonous. Concerns, queries, requests are rarely met and ""records of conversation"" are conducted frequently for the most minor of things. Management can be very patronising and you are made to feel like you are in school or have done something wrong a lot of the time. Recognition and praise for positive contributions that you make is rare. Flagship stores receive a lot more presence from national and regional managers and other stores are virtually ignored. A target based job where hitting goals of customer capture rates and sales is a must."
good,Suitable for someone who likes a challenge and also haven't got any other responsibilities ie children. As you will need to be flexible to reap the benefits of any shifts that comes up.
good,"Temporary agency staff mixed with long term staff, meaning training was difficult when the people would change everyday, things weren't organised. No room for progression or promotions."
good,"My time working at Estee Lauder as an Assembly worker was enjoyable at the beginning. It was a very fast paced environment. "
good,"Working for Estee Lauder for a short time I learnt quite a lot about the company and product knowledge which was interesting, however the workplace environment was very toxic in Debenhams Cambridge and I always worked alone which didn't help being new. The hardest part of the job overall was working in that store its such a shame I imagine working in another store I would have enjoyed working for the company."
good,"The store was so poorly managed, there was very little communication between management and employees. When asked direct questions, you were told they would get back to you, and then you never got a response."
good,"A typical day consisted of receiving a call to come in earlier or stay later due to the departments small staff. Most of the day consisted of matching customers for their perfect shade of foundation and treating them to a ten day sample. On rare occasions a novice makeup user would ask to be done up. If time allowed I would match them for their perfect day and night skincare routine as well as a possible natural, everyday or glam look depending on their preference. Time spent with customer didn't result in a huge sale and caused the one counter attendee to miss out on other sales to repeat customers. Management berated the department staff constantly due to customer wait, missed sales, and the minuscule overall total of credit card applications. The hardest part of the job would be the weeks leading up to gift and the start of gift with purchase. Pre-sales are mandatory, a goal is set depending on individuals part time or full time position. Convincing customers to pre-sale is extremely difficult as everyone believes they can come in on the first day and receive a gift failing to comprehend that it is while supplies last. A lot of people leave empty handed because our loyal clientele purchases enough to receive multiple gifts. Sometimes we receive back up gifts later down the road but really it is up in the air."
good,"Poste intéressant mais entreprise en pleine restructuration."
good,Estee Lauder is a great company to work for as long as you don't work in the retail department There is no chance for growth you either stay or leave.
good,"This was a fun seasonal job. I got to work during black friday, christmas and valentines day which are all very busy for a makeup counter and i loved the fast pace of it all!"
good,"Overall: good place to work"
good,"Unless you're an employee, The benefits of occasional free make-up or discounted products is not really a perk unless you think it is."
good,Company in itself is great. Good people. Great work environment. Temp agency is horrible that works out of Estee Lauder
good,This company is very nice. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know dedicated employees each day that has been apart of the company for years. You get to learn other people's perspective on the culture of the company and how it can be applied to your everyday life.
good,Sales goals have become unattainable most shifts and increased budget cuts for less work hours.Good account executives and product education/knowlege.
good,"Company lacks programs to develop existing staff and in recent years have looked outside to fill upper management positions. Unless you are a ""chosen one"" with influential contacts within the co. Compensation is also not competitive compared to industry standards."
good,"Es una empresa como buena escuela, se aprende mucho, tiene un ritmo acelerado. La cultura laboral, sin embargo, no es muy buena."
good,"They laid me off after 16 years with the company due to outsourcing to India. This ""project"" will continue for the next couple of years. They will continue to lay off their employees."
good,The benefits are great and so is the product discount.  Not the greatest work/life balance under new leadership.  It is a fast-paced environment and can be challenging at times.
good,never satisfied. continually losing employees due to work environment and culture built by inexperienced management. cross training of management was a plus.
good,"You get into the shift routine really quickly, the training provided is good. you spend your time on lines assembling products in two hour periods and are rotated on jobs throughout the day."
good,"Job was a retail position, stressful at certain times of the year. Coworkers very nice and atmosphere pleasant. Job had small commission but needs higher base pay"
good,The corporate mission is a something that the companies hold close. The company believes in the environment and practices the mission in all aspects of the corporate dealing.
good,"Es un buen ambiente laboral con horarios extendidos con semana inglesa."
good,"it good company for work ,nice co workers and culture and good management some time very heavy work good people work with"
good,"This company thrives off hiring temps.  They hire countless temps that outnumber the permanent employees.  It creates a bad environment when the perms are getting paid a LOT more to do the same work as the temps.  There needs to be a structure with an end date where the temp is temp to perm after a certain time period."
good,"Working at Clinique was a fast paced, fun environment. The versatility of the products and services helped me to connect and engage with all costumers. My overall experience at Clinique was a great learning experienced. It helped me to create skills for interacting with clients and building ongoing relationships."
good,"this was a good job to work for, i was alwaysat work and i learned so much. i can take the same things i learn and use them for where ever i go in my life."
good,Fun place to work with multiple team members.  Personality was a must or you did not stand out or show what you are capable of. Sales goals were exceeded .  I went above and beyond my goals to show that I wanted to be the top sales Beauty Advisor.
good,"Pro"
good,great group to work for.  Extremely tough to prove yourself to upper management.  It taught me a lot about working.
good,advancement in the company is very hard. I love working here and i have been with the company for 7 yrs. but there is no advancement in this position.
good,Leading others to success.  Meeting and collaborating with experts in the industry. Coaching & Developing skills and talents.
good,"A large retailer with large brand name and attractive, quality merchandise but company definitely operates with a very close concern on daily/shift sales goals and acquiring credit accounts. Retail schedule, as with any retailer, will include many evenings, weekends and holidays. Also the company's scheduling system is a constant problem and complaint of all employees universally at all locations. Most employees show extreme concern over their report card performance due to unrealistic sales goals and pressure. The goals are meant to 'motivate' but in most cases cause undue stress, tension and animosity and highly competitive attitudes and unpleasantness among workers as they will all constantly feel the need to be cut throat and out-do each other and each harass customers to get the sale."
good,"Excelente empresa, que brindaba estabilidad laboral y oportunidades de desarrollo profesional asi como poder en practica los conocimientos adquiridos  durante el desarrollo de la carrera."
good,"I have been highly trained to work in stressful, fast paced environments, great customer service both in person and on telephone, always on time, love working with adults and children."
good,"Good experience overall. Terrific organization. Great benefits package. Great company perks. There was an overwhelming volume of work and although executive management advised that the organization paid competitively, it does not. Workplace culture included a high sense of urgency at all times. Met some great people at the organization."
good,"Una bella esperienza fi lavoro"
good,"Good place to work as long as you don't plan on making it your career."
good,"A typical day at work is just setting up the computer , maintaining the products and the store cleanliness first thing inn the morning.then proceed to reading emails from the company's group chat to update on whats happening for the day.when customers walk in greet them and proceed to helping if needed. Hardest part is that the counter has not enough employees so when its during a peek period its difficult to juggle between all of the customers.most enjoyable part of the job is that the colleagues were nice to each other to make the job easier and enjoyable."
good,I loved the flexible work hours. I loved how they had multiple breaks for the employees. They were clean and had great safety precautions. Everything was organized.
good,"My manager was awesome but some of the other management won’t really give you many options to grow within the company, I tried working for a Dallas location and the management wasn’t very welcoming,"
good,"my review overall of the  company , was great in the children,s  dept, however, after transferring to cosmetics was very slow and competitive,   No team work , it was  a very tense work situation."
good,leuk bedrijf om voor te werken maar qua werkdruk en organisatie een grote chaos.
good,"The brand is extensive with many options to work across the country. The work is varied, higher management experiencing a heavy workload, which is often at times difficult to keep on top off."
good,"it was great working for Estee Lauder, I enjoyed interacting with the customers and my fellow employees. I got discounts on clothes and makeup, and commission on makeup sales."
good,"Reliant on good benefits. Stressful place to work. They are hiring like a ""lean, mean machine"" but expecting employees to work overtime and on weekends to compensate for lack of staff."
good,Not a lot of room for growth. You have to be really good at what you do or know somebody in management to recommend you to move up. Only worked here during school days but did not feel like will be advanced so left company for better opportunity. Good benefits only if you get a full time opportunity.
good,"Estee Lauder was fun in regards to working with customers and helping them achieve their makeup needs. Estee Lauder corporate was inflexible and difficult to work with however. They expected Estee Lauder employees to look and perform like robots and apply makeup a very specific way which, in artistry, there shouldn't be any rules! Compensation was minimal and the schedule was inflexible."
good,Perform multiples tasks with the ability to pay attention to detail and meet demanding deadlines. Maintain a personal sales and client appoint schedule technique to promote sales. Successfully assisted with the creation of a phone calls to advise for any promotions and give tanks to all the clients.
good,Pay is okay - could be much better. Company is very hierarchical and it's tough to progress. Many people often leave and come back. Benefits are pretty good but hours are long and tech is horrible.
good,"Estée can be a fun company to work for and the benefits are wonderful - free products, company store discounts, summer Friday's where you leave early every Friday and you get the equivalent of 5 additional vacations days between Memorial Day and Labor Day in addition to the standard benefits of health and dental. And they always have a celebration for project completion. But advancement just doesn't happen. Rather than promoting from within, they hire from the outside. And outsourcing is gaining favor over actual employees. If a third part provider is hired, regardless of what they say, employees will be gone. Working three day weekends, doing 5 am conference calls or working overnight for global support gets a lot of lip service but very little actual appreciation is felt. You will have some awesome, dedicated and extremely knowledgeable coworkers."
good,"We started everyday with stretches to prevent getting hurt at the job. I was in sortation so it could get pretty tedious at times, but the days moved quickly. My co-workers were friendly, but there was a high turnover rate."
good,Working at Estee Lauder as a receptionist was great because I got an opportunity to be exposed to many different brands on different floors.
good,"A typical day at my work was very busy and eclectic, doing multitasking activities, learning about how to set inventory layout etc.,, having great coworkers, can't said the same about the management team, who were the hardest part of the job."
good,"special events ,promotions, make up ,orders sales ,cleaning of the working space .i loved sale part of it ,i was great at it .love learning different things and seeing people from every culture. I had so much fun during the events but it was also stressful  still it was a great experience"
good,"Overall, ELC is a good place to work but it really depends on your department and who the leader of that department is. Depending on who they are, you can advance or not advance and your the office culture/ your work/life balance would be dependent on it. It is a good company to have on your resume and start out but for the younger workforce (millennials), it is hard to advance because HR has so many rules and they really just work on advancing Directors above. Anyone under the Director level can be pigeon-holed unless you work for certain executives in the company who really will help you advance much quicker."
good,I loved my job. Although my territory was too large to manage with a family.
good,"I worked at Estee Lauder as a consultant."
good,Your just a sales number not a individual. There not much room for advancement the pay is not the best and barely average for the cosmetics world. Cooperate doesn't not care about you as an employee just the sales you make. Great gratis and fellow co workers though. Hardest part of the job was making the daily sales goal.
good,Most boring of all cosmetic companies with little room for advancement but decent job security. Highly political environment that seems more like a popularity contest then a results-oriented business.
good,"I loved my job. I loved what is did, I just didn’t ever feel important or appreciated. The corporation cut hours and benefits for employees and I felt very let down, for my loyalty."
good,Gerne kann man mich fragen doch schriftlich werde ich keine Angaben machen oder mich auf irgend eine Äusserung einlassen.
good,"•	Review and analyze business performance of daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual sales results"
good,"I have worked within the contact centre for almost 5 years. Micro management, not enough communication from the management, nice perks though and friendly colleagues. Unfortunately the company's main concern are the managers rather than the 'little' employees."
good,"very corporate work environment, turning around a traditional company. Becoming more digital first but they need to fuse together a few departments. Growth is good for the company overall, some brands are still struggling."
good,was not give any formal training on any aspect of my job (I am only a freelancer though). Love working with make up and skin care but i was never given any information about the products so i often find it hard to help customers when the full time employees are busy
good,"Fast Paced, Challenging, Job tasks change every day, Exposure to upper management, Ownership for projects, No micro-managing, Exposure to many cross functional teams"
good,"-stressful work environment"
good,"Animal testing is outdated, cruel and entirely unnecessary but EL refuses to stop, as many other major companies have. That revels a lot about a company."
good,Providing raw material from various buildings transported to main hub at Research Park. Distributed said materials to various labs at Research Park. Coordinated with various chemists on location of materials through several buildings located in the New York City area.   Coordination of said duties through Microsoft Office programs as well as telecommunication.
good,a typical day at work was doing online shopping orders and all day everyday and occasionally i went over the other side to do packing if they needed extra help. the workplace was a warehouse team was great but your basically working on your own the hardest thing is being in steal cap boots and on your feet all day long and with one break
good,Estee Lauder has changed a lot over the past 5 years with the influx of upper management from other companies.  Doing more with less became the norm and workplace culture was adversely affected.  There were more opportunities to learn but less time due to workload.
good,working in a warehouse you need steel toe boots glasses and a hairnet. i learned how beauty products were put into bottles and tubes. how to box and label shipping boxes properly.
good,"Working for this company was very fast paced, and extremely competitive. But the position allowed me to gain expirience in current make-up styles and facial products being used by woman today."
good,"I worked and business was very slow, I startd in the children,s dept, I did very well very busy, however, cosmetic very slow , Laid off for lack of customers coming into store to make sales quota,,,"
good,"selection and packing of orders, variety of shifts and good staff discount in shop. Opportunity to progress if you work hard enough. Physical job overall on your feet all day and carrying heavy goods sometimes."
good,"My experience with The Estee Lauder Companies and their roles is very poor. I've worked within two brands within the company, and it doesn't appear that the company puts enough forethought into the budgets pertaining running a successful business on top of the educational demands that the corporation puts on their sales managers and associates. I believe there needs to be restructuring done from the top to truly create change on a sales-level."
good,"Travail dans le Luxe, ideal pour une premiere experience"
good,There are positives and negatives to working here. The people are passionate about their work and typically very nice. The brand stands for something positive in a negative industry which is very refreshing.
good,"I was a process server, putting together perfumes, boxing them, putting on skids, and wrapping them for pickup. Adequate management. Very stressful to keep up with line duties, not enough pay. No advancement. Worked with mainly Haitian people."
good,Fantastic learning company the best and still is many years ago I began my career with them and was thrilled to meet Mrs. Lauder at the time and work with an amazing team.
good,"Lovely rewarding temporary job working  in warehouse , order picking and gift wrap for customers all over the country. Methodical work and busy with excellent rewards"
good,"Organize team of workers on production floor to maximize production and meet monthly quotas."
good,Es una buena empresa para trabajar con la nueva implementacon de sistemas hay que tener paciencia para que se ordenen nuevamente y todo siga su curso.
good,"Entreprise très bien positionnée sur le segment de la distribution sélective. Une gamme de produits très étoffée, un marketing judicieux et une ambiance motivante."
good,Overall this was a fun place to work interacting with the public can be stressful at times but overall a good place to work. Other associates were always willing to help out.
good,"A good workplace, good culture. High demands, and too many external hires has changed the culture a bit. Overall a good place to work. Great brands too."
good,"A typical day at The Estée Lauder involved a lot of paperwork. Helping the Vice President of the Archives Department with the different programs she sponsored. Creating document, entering data, serving as hostess at conferences."
good,"Great company to have an intro to the cosmetic industry since Estee Lauder owns most major brands of cosmetics.  Learning basic skills for management, selling, customer service and overall product knowledge is great."
good,"Estee isn't really a big issue, its the department stores you work for who only care about credit apps. I've seen some pull counters out of a 30,000 deficits and the store management could care less because no credit apps were opened. Estee does try to look out for their own though it seems like they're caught right now between being faithful to old clientele and attracting trendy clientele. But I will say their yearly inflation of product prices doesn't help much at all in regards to the ever-growing affordable competition. All in all, nothing you do will ever be satisfactory in retail. STAY AWAY FROM MACYS."
good,"Start the day with making sure that the cash register has enough money; and make sure that the environment is clean for the customers and make sure that I have positive attitude. "
good,"I left this company with a whole new level of respect for counter mangers, so much pressure, lots of competition with the other counters around you. Overall not too bad"
good,"No Inicio da minha integração na Empresa, era super gratificante trabalhar para a ESTEE LAUDER, havia união na Empresa entre colaborador/chefias directas e indirectas, havia diálogo, motivação, dedicação, com a mudança ao longo dos anos de uma empresa quase que familiar para uma empresa Multinacional, passamos a ser um numero e não o colaborador."
good,ryhme soutenu au travail. Pas mal d'adaptation entre les Etats-Unis et le reste de l'Europe. Formation du personnel et grande équipe
good,Making yourself and work area presentable.  Checking stock and reordering.  Sales motivated.  I enjoyed the feel good factor that people would buy a product to treat themselves.  Didn't enjoy standing for long hours.
good,"Great corporate culture even in day to day activities, average managers not interested in developing a team, friendly people at first, later can be our worst enemies, vertical organization at any level. Is a good place to get once you are out of college to learn how to manage hectic situations"
good,only thing I never like..senoirs or full time peoples rude behavior.otherwise best and clean place..good manner to doing work..
good,"Entreprise familial "
good,"too many events, sales goals too high. enjoyed working with my coworkers. boss does not appreciate hard work, only criticizes"
good,"its fast phase work and you have to give your full concentration since we do certain expensive products in the plant and cant afford to make mistakes. "
good,"Dinamik bir ortam"

good,"The training you receive is fantastic."
good,Positive experience in regards to travel location is not the most accessible.
good,internship for the summer before my senior year of college. Useful experience in using systems such as SAP.
good,A typical day I would come into work and clean makeup brushes and get ready to do customers makeup. The most enjoyable part of my job was making customers feel beautiful. The hardest part of my job was cold calling customers and asking them to purchase makeup.
good,"It's General labour work"
good,Very demanding work environment. Opportunities for advancement are plentiful for the go-getter.
good,"If you are below director level, very slow to move up in the company."
good,"Provides solid foundation for entry and mid-level management"
good,"Ces années en sein de l'entreprise m'ont permis d'évoluer et d'acquérir de nouvelles compétences. L'assiduité, le dynamisme et l'organisation sont primordials pour la gestion d'une boutique."
good,It is a nice company to work for.  If you would like to know more about working for this company I can disclose over the phone.
good,"Good place to get government work experience."
good,"Strong SAP background "
good,"i really liked working here i was on my feet, the entire shift working really hard."
good,"Responsable for team sales performances"
good,Management was not that great and there is a lot of pressure. it was overall a fun place to work. you meet as lot of people.
good,"Position required wearing many hats, so the most valuable lesson learned was time management and prioritization.  Internal promotion was difficult in this position."
good,"many people May Enjoy working for Estee Lauder, Great Company!"
good,"Friendly People, Good Work, Good Managers and Staff. Worked here for two years. Not fulfilling work since I was working with cosmetics. But if a cosmetic company is something you would want to work for then this would be a great place."
good,air conditioned. factory work.must be ontime . part time and full time hours.
good,"a typical day at work would be, doing light stretches, listening to the line leader where as they would tell you what you are doing for the day. performing the tasks and then cleaning up the workplace. The hardest part of the job would be having the physical and mental stamina to perform remedial tasks. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the co workers are very friendly and everyone looks out for one another "
good,Being a vendor you are in and out of different department stores. It is fast-paced and you deal with customers all day.
good,Inadequate when it comes to provide a workspace. But good to work for if the employee is a full time.
good,great product to represent and customers can be fun. i enjoyed this company although i had to leave for personal reasons that took me out of the area.
good,"It is a very nice place to work,everyone is very kind.I learned a lot about team work.I learned about how the product is made. How to check the quality of the work,how much to fill the bottle with the product.I learned how to check to make sure that caps are tight.also I learned a lot about what the mechanics do on the production line.I also learned that you should treat people with respect and not take advantage of them.the hardest part of the job was having to leaving it. I loved working there.It was a family.I enjoyed laughing and having fun but also doing the job correctly.It made me feel good when the product came out with no rejects.It was a source of accomplishment"
good,the pay is not good enough. the co-coordinator is very rude and interrupt in every one's work.
good,Was a nice experience to work here. People were respectful and loving. Always selling products and hitting the monthly goal each time. Providing feedback to better sell chances and always looking forward to achieve new clientele
good,"Enjoyed my time there, however men get paid more than women, as a manager I seen this happen on many of the brands. Hard to advance past counter manager role. Sometimes targets ridiculously unachievable "
good,"Fast paced abd highly systematic management . Females workers definitely are treated equally as males, and colleagues are generally strong and professional."
good,A empresa passa por algumas dificuldades em cascatear a estratégia e alterações de decisões. A principal reclamação interna é que a maioria dos processos não são 100% seguidos devido alguma decisão top down ou exceções de operações. Esses problemas geram um grande retrabalho e frustração a maioria dos funcionários.
good,Estee Lauderr its very good place. Lots of bonus plus goodie bags twice every year. At the moment at Estee its very difficult moment lots of changes for people.
good,Nice environment but jobs are moving oversees and there is no job security. I was a contractor but I heard they have very good benefits and vacation time
good,"Does require effort. Pays some bills. Usually positive environment. Usually positive employees. Usually positive management. Very few benefits, depends."
good,Not a bad place to work but pay sucks and the people are great and supportive. The culture has changed over the year and management could use a shake up.
good,"Tienen buenos regalos  ,dotaciones,semestrales y cursos para atencion al cliente   aunque lo malo esque se trabaja toda la semana y se rolan los turnos"
good,"Worked for 2 wonderful CEO's who liked me a lot.  It was wonderful to work with them for the time frame needed.  "
good,"Working in estee lauder is busy but can be fun "
good,"* exceeded goal, planned events, trained team."
good,"The company always tell you how ""You are the most important people in the whole company"" however i don't feel as though we are treated this way. "
good,"I write before my experience in CADC, was good, you need to write down  again??? It's ok, I liked that place especially the pleople and the team work."
good,"Great respect for senior leadership and values of corporation, although culture at corporate level vs. individual teams not consistent.  "
good,"Trabajo de promotora y apoyo del punto de venta,el centro donde trabajaba era bastante poco visitado por clientes,pero eso me daba tiempo a conocer mas el producto con el que trabajaba."
good,Overworked in an uptight environment. It is an older crowd with an old school mentality. Overall the company has good benefits.
good,"Great position. Lots of management changes. Very micromanaging. I like the job and my co-workers. I am a vendor in a government exchange so we need to abide by both regulations, the exchange and my company."
good,Compensation and room for advancement and growth is lacking. Company would rather hire outside talent that groom employees within the company. Benefits are really good.
good,"as most retail sales, this is a job can help you survive but you dont get too much respection. you have to work under stress and so often you have to talk to people on your day off or at night to answer their questions."
good,Experience here has overall been positive. The employees are typically been very driven and smart across all levels of the organization. Compensation is mediocre for the industry average (especially at the lower levels with less than 7 years experience).
good,No room for growth. Temps are not given a chance to apply for permanent roles. No job security/advancement. Compensation is ok
good,"Nice place to work. While a public company still operating as family owned.  If you are connected with someone at the family or someone connected to the family you will be OK.  If not, your career is a gamble at the mercy of your supervisor.  HR does not get involved in anything but hiring."
good,"My typical work day includes servicing clients and maintaining my goals for the day."
good,"Quota's to meet daily and weekly. Had to make cold calls to set"
good,"Overall, it is a lovely company. Execution pace is very slow...extremely slow. Due to the top heavy alignment."
good,Una experiencia laboral enriquecedora que no solo aumento mucho mis conocimientos de relaciones interpersonales en todos los niveles sociales; si no que me dio la oportunidad de introducirme en el mundo de la cosmetica avanzada.

good,"Lovely job and the average day is lovely. "
good,"It's a relatively flat hierarchy; however, the stagnant culture makes it hard to motivate. There are good opportunities to connect with peers and the community."
good,"Pros:"
good,If you can get past the fact you are basically working in a playground for ' adults ' then you can do very well here some of the perks are very good and most of the people are ok on the whole.
good,"productive and fun workplace with nice environment"
good,It takes a certain type of personality to work for retail cosmetics. You must have very thick skin and be very competitive. It is a very cut-throat environment and sales are key to success.
good,"There is a very close family culture at the company."
good,"This job doesn't care about you but it pays every week. It's very diverse but the staff doesn't know how to talk to people, they try to belittle you, etc. getting the product done is more important than what you have going on. All the work we do, the pay should be higher"
good,"It's stressful at first especially for someone who doesn't know everything about the products, but after a while it's great for gaining customer experience and building confidence in a busy but exciting working environment."
good,"The time I worked there was too short to comment.  "
good,"The best part of the job was performing treatments, training, serving and approaching customers. The hardest part demanding targets and stressful environment"
good,"It's a good company but hard to move up. Some employees are under agency or 2-3 years before they get absorbed, and when they do, they have another 2-3 years in the same position. The product allowance is always appreciated though, and the people are nice enough. Still, at the end of the day, you'll be working with mostly girls, and girls can be catty."
good,"infuse some special client care or an appreciation for sales:"
good,"I enjoy my coworkers and the work is interesting enough.  Management lacks a clear vision and strategy.  There are a lot of redundancies, egos, and lofty aspirations without clarity on how to get from point A to B.  In general, our leadership is big on the appearance of self-importance, but too frequently without substance to back it up.  And they appear to believe that they are much more highly regarded by the organization than is true.  Some would call this behavior delusional."
good,"Same routine everyday, feels like your days are depressing. It is very organized the way they do things, but its not somewhere I would personally want to stay for the rest of my career."
good,"A typical day would be running a line with other workers  to get the job done overall the job is easy not that difficult of a job. Has many people working there, everyone is working together to get the job done, its a team type of job.  everyone is friendly and well organize  and  they all care for the quality of the product   for the job. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the breaks that we receive and meeting different people."
good,"Was a good place to work, you would meet alot of friendly faces whilst doing you're one of many job roles."
good,"•	Quickly build rapport with customers in order to "

good,Es entretenido trabajar en Estee el problema es que falta personal y hay mucha carga laboral y pocas personas que están para apoyar en caso de contingencias
good,"Muchos cursos de formación Online, formación continua."
good,"Excellent place to work if you become permanent to receive discount on product, benefits and bonus. I however do not have enough hours to make a living. I am looking to use my knowledge and education to become a legal assistant or administrative assistant in a more professional job atmosphere. I have gained excellent customer service and top sales when in a team or managing independently. Well organized and great time management."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced with daily firefighting drills to protect business objectives.  There are multiple cross functional meetings during the day. I'm a supply chain problem solver with direct responsibility for the development and coaching of team on professional and business situations. I bring the best balance solution to the company and internal/external business partners on a daily basis.  I'm a supply chain executive that quickly aligns tactical efforts to strategic initiatives to support sustainable business growth.

good,estee lauder was a highly motivated and fun company to work for. they had high expectations.very knowledgeable and had informative classes.Macys was a good place to work they had good training programs. knowledgable management. focused on customer service. they had great motivational skills
good,"Working for Estee Lauder is fun yet can sometimes feel a little stressful. The environment itself is very fun and energetic, you learn something new everyday if not from your peers then from a client. Management are always working in bettering their employees, making sure they stay on track and helping them grow within the company. The hardest part of the job is making sure you numbers/goal is on top weekly and meets standards. The most enjoyable part of the job is making your customers/ private clients feel beautiful. Giving them the amazing unforgettable experience with confidence its Estee Lauder is all about."
good,"Driving retail sales by motivating my team by leading by example. Developing my team via daily coaching. "
good,"The most enjoyable and memorable part of working with Estee Lauder, was all my team member's my counter manager so much love and support , it was so much fun working together like the strong team we were , which lead to such an amazing experience with customers and sales pro-activity."
good,Es una empresa muy buena sólo la gente es l que hace la diferencia en la empresa
good,"Consistently give an exceptional internal/external customer service"
good,"It was a retail job, so it wasn't the best but gave me good experience in dealing with different types of people and situations.  My manager was not the best, but I loved my coworkers and got to play with and try out makeup and skincare products all day!"
good,Estee is not a bad company to work for but the management of Stage Stores treated employees very unfair and was often picking favorites with whoever was new.
good,My 3 years of experience with this company was good and bad. I think Estee Lauder is a great company but some if its brands could do better. The brand I worked for (Aveda) had high sales expectations which would be fine if there was a steady customer base. Management is Self driven and will do whatever it takes to keep their head above water.
good,"Estée Lauder the company is ok, the problem is the department stores they affiliate with such as Dillard's, Macy's, Belk, etc. Outside of Estée Lauder there are a lot of separate department store expectations"
good,"I’ve been with Estee Lauder for over 10 years now.  I started and served as a Temporary full time employee in the Information Systems department, for 2 six month periods beginning from July 2003 to July 2004.  I then remained in the same position, but was paid under a consulting agency (Randstad) for approximately another year and a ½.  It wasn’t until January of 2006 that I was hired as a permanent employee of Estee Lauder, here in the Payroll department, in which I still currently work.  Since 2006 I have excelled in my work performance year after year, and was inevitably promoted from a non-exempt coordinators position to an Exempt Administrators position.   From July 2003 to approximately 2010, has been and amazing experience working for Estee Lauder.  We have a strong corporate culture base, as well as excellent benefits and perquisites.  The atmosphere on an organizational level has been remarkable.  Estee Lauder continues to strive for excellence when I comes to becoming a more family oriented organization, i.e. the newly instated parental leave policies, enhanced dental benefits, etc.  In addition, Estee Lauder continues to sustain its philanthropic reputation by maintaining its consistent charitable donations to various organizations and fundraisers for worthy causes. "
good,There are an umbrella of brands to work for under ELC. I’ve worker exempt and non exempt with a hair & makeup brand. Overall be careful because there is definitely a gender pay gap. Know your market worth based on your relevant experience.
good,Una multinacional sólida en el mercado internacional
good,I really enjoyed traveling to all the different locations around the Puget Sound.  It really challenged my creativity.  Also Estee Lauder challenged me to create goals for myself.  I really enjoyed being my own manager.  The best part was being able to help women feel Beautiful.
good,"Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar porém, com diversos problemas como qualquer outra organização de grande porte"
good,"Lauder is an amazing brand to be a part of. I couldn't fault my management team. The store i worked in however was a nightmare, Boots. Most of the management are power hungry unemphatic and lazy bar a few. the experience of the whole time i worked there has seriously made me reconsider whether i want to work in the retail industry again its just filled with a bunch of bullies."
good,"lovely company. Great staff, fast pace environment with plenty of foot fall, strong customer base"
good,"I was working for the agency, so i dont have any benefits, no holiday pay. Also there are some days that they will ask you not to come to work. It's a multi culturaly environment."
good,Work life balance needs some work but the people are very smart and driven. Benefits are great but compensation is lower than others in the same industry.
good,"I worked at Estée Lauder Companies full-time. "
good,I only worked 2 months every year so I didn't get all that much experience. It's a factory job with 8 hour shifts. Everyone else there seem to be close knit.
good,typically during the day it may be slow it may be fast paced. It has a lot of recruiting to bring in new clients to demonstrate and educate about any new products that were trending on the market. Working with this company taught me many different things about cosmetics and skin care. What i loved about my job was servicing my clients and helping them find and purchase the products that were meant for them as well as solving any issue my clients had to ensure great quality service. Hardest part was upselling products or getting a customer to buy when sometimes they just want samples and may not buy any products.
good,The job was exciting and interesting. I learned new things and I liked doing it. I enjoyed working with different people. The best part of the jobs was making perfumes and getting to smell the different fragrances. The worst part of the job was the mess we would have to clean up after the work was finished.
good,"TR is a great department to work for, very fast paced and a lot of travel throughout MEA region. Mostly, the company takes care of employees.  You need some stamina and sometimes a thick skin."
good,"La giornata di lavoro tipo è caratterizzata dallo svolgimento di tanti compiti diversi, varia e dinamica. "
good,"Great job, however I worked at a department store and it ended up filling bankruptcy so I needed to find a new job. Estee Lauder is a great company to work for!"
good,"It's great at first and if you're a one-man counter it's a lot of fun because you're left to get on with it."
good,"There was a lot of hard work involved and you had to be quick. You have to follow the protocol what ever happens, you follow the protocol and lot of manual labour."
good,The work environment and work place is excellent. Coworkers are friendly and works as a team. There are just some plans that are not communicated at an earlier time to concerned employees.
good,"i liked my job, the pay was not great and not comparable. Advancement or movement to other areas could be difficult, especially if you were good at your job"
good,"One of the best places to work. Management needs to address HR and be more involved in career discussions, and be better at following up on those discussions."
good,"A typical day includes but not limited to, working with other staff members to ensure that the daily work schedule is adhered to and completed on time. My main duty is to ensure that all the equipment are maintained, cleaned and ready for use."
good,"Este un mediu placut in care înveti informatii utile care te ajuta atat pe plan personal cat si profesional, cu posibilitate de avansare"
good,Overall the experience at Estee Lauder was very fun. We learned about customer service and learned how to properly take care of oneself. The only thing bad about this environment is that you are required to make a certain amount in sales which can sometimes be difficult when people are not able to spend.
good,Was in Inventory Control.  Visited warehouses on a weekly basis where products were stored and maintain a log of inventory
good,Great Company to work for but a lot of higher management does not allow you to grow.
good,"Working in highly female crowded company was a challenging environment.  It is complex but I learned the most about communication skills.  Constructing a good piece conversation or email is critical in order to be successful in this industry,  Typically forecasting is always the contradicting to a finance operation team member like us, whom are trying to balance financial impact with brand management (especially long standing brand like Clinique)"
good,"Lipstick line assembly, packing and machine trouble shooting"
good,"Gergin yogun ve dusuk maas."
good,There is no typical day. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities.
good,Great company and the experience was phenomenal.. Traveling  with the National Makeup team was a great opportunity. Preparing for our National Makeup Artistry events was a great experience.
good,i enjoyed working at Estee Lauder Companies a lot. My coworkers were nice and very fun. I learnt a lot about my job as a sales person. I also developed my organizational skills a lot.
good,"Eccellente datore di lavoro nel complesso, con i pro ed i contro come d'altronte ogni azienda offre ai propi dipendenti. Un unico difetto, i contro vengono decisi da chi non svolge neppure una giornata sul posto di lavoro."
good,It is a great place to work!  It's a 24 hour operation with multiple sites.  Employees rarely leave the company and there are opportunities to work in other departments depending on needs.
good,"Bei Estée Lauder Companies kann man sehr viel lernen. Die Teams sind sehr nett und die Hierarchien flach. Man braucht Ambitionen um sich weiterzuentwickeln. Wenn man Ambitionen besitzt, wird man durch Beförderungen belohnt."
good,"Cosmetics firms rely on department and specialty store beauty advisers to develop relationships with customers, nurture brand loyalty and sell their products. Major cosmetics lines provide on-the-job training for products and makeup application techniques to help their beauty advisers succeed. They also provide expert assistance -- regional makeup artists -- for special events to draw traffic to the store and increase sales opportunities."
good,Exelente Empresa te enseña mucho y el tiempo se te hace corto cuando haces lo que te gusta
good,Working for Estee Lauder has been a very fun and fulfilling experience. I love the product and enjoy sharing the benefits with customers. I realized I have a passion for working with people but can also be driven to achieve personal goals.
good,fantastic company to work for and have many benefits. Selling skills area must as there are high priced products and have to have confidence in selling an knowing the brand. if you want to progress within this company it can be hard as there are not many routes you can go down.
good,"Great benefits and perks. Flexible working hours. However, work politics and too many layers will prevent you from climbing up the corporate ladder. Some positions have great travel benefits."
good,"Working for this company and going to assigned department stores as freelance makeup artist is exciting, can be challenging also. Show, tell and assure is my method in introduction. Recruiting, with foundation and our #1 serum is the key of the day.  Everyone, wants beautiful skin and clients see my skin they feel it can be done."
good,"A typical work day at times can be stressful, but my coworkers and I worked as a team. My training skills have improved since working at Estee Lauder."
good,"The benefits are really great."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work at, structured environment, and easy going as well. It is also a pleasant setting, beautiful design too. I enjoyed working there."
good,Loved working here - well compensated. There's a lot of sales pressure but fairly compensated for what you're putting in each day. The people are usually fun and the sales conferences get you really pumped up. Free gratis!
good,"Customers are fun but sometimes demanding and difficult."
good,definitely wasn't the brand for me. The uniforms were awful/outdated and the fragrances made me have  headaches. The brand is lacking newness and excitement.
good,"Fun and competitive, asked too much from you to accomplish, traveling to very far distance, fun part is makeover for people, the before and after is amazing"
good,"It was a good experience. Sometimes we used to work stand for many hours and it is so hard to do. Also, there is easy work that done so quickly and easily while sitting."
good,not much hectic its kinda seasonal specially in my department but the Supervisor are good they treat us nice they give us something every Christmas as a present and good raise per hr.
good,"Was a great experince to wirk in Estee Lauder Company."
good,"Lack of growth, not much feedback given. Very discouraging for temp employees as you are constantly doing the same work everyday. Not learning as much"
good,"I worked full time (2 years) at Estee Lauder is an American manufacturer and marketer of prestige skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. I had a neutral opinion on the company."
good,Learned a lot of make-up skills and how to communicate with customers in beauty retail industry
good,"I loved the job itself.  I loved the product.  However, I did not like being in charge of there ppl.  I did not like the hours mostly bc my husband had to work similar ones and we have 3 children."
good,"ELC is a great company to work for. Company offers great benefits i.e 401k, RGA, health and insurance. On a top of that there are other programs for the employees. I definitely recommend this company."
good,Fun and great company product  incentives.  Sales goals and personal connections are a must to succeed.  Working in the beauty departments is fun and it makes you feel pretty.  Teamwork is important and being reliable as well.
good,It has been good company but the comapny will nt soon permemant so that I leave it so that all the employment will not long term work there so the pepole find the better place there
good,"Employees were great, management was good, this job was pure customer service and the products we sold where awesome. A great place to work but only if you are a female"
good,Estee Lauder provides growth opportunities leading to career advancement and/or cross-training in current roles.  They provide learning tools to incorporate skill knowledge and education.  The benefits are very well which includes an excellent 401k match. The company continues to grow which will prepare them to be the place of employment!
good,Opportunity for a lot of exposure and ability to work with great brands and talented people.  Work hours are long and there is not a good balance between work and life.
good,"Demanding, but rewarding organisation, strategically focused on growing the business and recognising exceptional employees for their achievements."
good,This was a temp position but I learned a lot moving around to the different departments.  I learned about the different steps needed for bottle designs (perfume) as well as retail store development.
good,"Very busy cosmetics line."
good,So many aspects to the company and so much to learn. A wonderful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the various people you will meet from Scientists to Ph.D's.
good,Everyday is a brand new day because you will never know whom you are going to serve or what nationality are you going to  meet.  I learned diffirent methods of serving and dealing customers. The bi-annual trainings did help me a lot in keeping up with what is new and in demand in the market.
good,"Hay carga de trabajo, pero siempre tienes apoyos. Es una gran escuela de formación y cuentas con ""grandes profesores"". La dirección es muy humana y muy profesional y sabe del negocio más que nadie..."
good,working at whitmans was fun and challenging at the same time so many things to do there and tricky things to learn but thats the fun part also good conversation with the other people that worked there
good,"Very friendly colleagues and a great place to work for. As a marketing intern, I learned a lot about new product launches and keeping an eye on the changes in the market."
good,"i enjoyed my time working with estee lauder there were loads of nice poeple to help you out if needed i made loads of new friends during my time there, it was a fast paced environment which kept you on your toes at times, i learnt how to keep up with the work and i learnt how do make up certain boxes etc. i also learnt about what the manufacturers made within the factory i was in. "
good,As an on-site consultant I found Estee to be very well organized and supportive of the work we were doing to migrate them to better system.
good,"I love having a job where I wake up in the morning and look forward to being at work because I love what I do as well as my co workers and my management team. The pay is great, the benefits are awesome. It doesn't even feel like work!"
good,"Ambiente stimolante, crescita e formazione continua nel tempo. Incontro con professionisti del settore del make up"
good,I enjoy my time with The Estee Lauder Companies. As a top preforming company in the marketplace it was exciting and extremely rewarding to work in a global environment interacting with different cultures. I had exposure to many different functions of the daily business with direct control of operation budgets in the 100's of millions.
good,"nice working atmosphere, team work,possible if person having ability to learn to achieve the goals there is a chance. everything planed before taking action people are nice. good management skills are used to keep the reputation up i learned o lot in this company i was packer when i join the company through agency but when my contract finished i was working as a machine operator on line 11 there i assist the process coordinator in variance,inventory of component to be used or return. performs line clearance after job finished.experienced in working in a GMP environment. also member of same line 11 changeover team."
good,A place to be truly global covering all categories in the prestige beauty industry.  The brand building talent is quite impressive.
good,"•	Recommended products to customers based on their needs, concerns, and preference. "
good,"Exciting & flexible company with exceptional employee benefits, talented leaders and awesome co-workers."
good,"As an Account Executive was responsible for 22 stores, 60 employees and sales of $10M.  Primary role was to exceed sales plan through the development of my team.  Hiring and retaining top talent was key.  Responsible for inventory and budgets.  Developing strong retail partnerships was invaluable and accomplished this through building trust and owner ship of the business.  A typical day was traveling to two stores in either NY, NJ, CT or PA.  Meeting with store management to negotiate additional hours, space and location.Coaching and developing the team.  I had excellent relationships with my peers and management.  The most difficult part of the job was on boarding new buyers.  The most enjoyable was exceeding sales expectations."
good,"Working for Macys was interesting, the company thinks very differently about different employees, depending on how many credits you open. They want you to assist everyone but not leave your department. I like Estee Lauder as a company more than I did Macys."
good,"Estee Lauder gives employees continuous training such as management trainings, product knowledge training, and new product launch training. Employees attend three full-day seminars a year to learn about new product launches and sales strategies. Managers attend full-day employee develpment training once a month."
good,"Great learning experience"
good,"A typical day consists of managing 4 team members, making our sales day, coaching and developing my team while keeping the atmosphere upbeat and positive. I have learned much about managing different types of people and how to change my coaching style to best suit the type of person I am developing. I have also learned how to drive sales and market in a fun yet productive manner. The hardest part of my job being in 4 places at once- on the floor managing my own business, coaching and developing my team, pulling numbers and emailing, and planning and executing events. This also happens to be the most enjoyable part of my job. I love being successful, seeing results, making the customer happy, and driving business."
good,"The first thing I do at work is determine my daily sales goal. After doing so I check my card file from the previous day to do my thank you calls. After thank you calls, I call another group of clients for a two week follow up and then another group about their three month replenishment. When phone calls are done, I greet and service customers. Recruiting new customers is essential to building my clientele. At the end of the day I record my daily sales and clean the counter."
good,"Great office vibe, nice people to work with, collaborative work environment."
good,I enjoyed my time at Estee Lauder however I do wish there was more room for advancement within the company. I was in the call center and they typically like to keep the employees in the call center without giving them the opportunity to explore other areas of the company.
good,"Fun, friendly and fast paces environment. The company made sure you were very well educated and kept up to date on all products and how to demonstrate them as well as gave us products to use ourselves. Pre-Sale time is very high pressure, but other then that they are an amazing company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work involved preparing the counter & team for business making sure the counter and all the products on display were clean and the shelves were fully stocked to achieve the maximun of sales, making sure the team were up to date with their product knowledge to ensure we / they were all promoting brand awareness of estee lauder and any new product launches."
good,I really enjoyed to customer interaction and working toward targets with a great team of people. However I did not agree morally with the company for environmental reasons.
good,"well balanced work life, professional and friendly colleagues"
good,I love the products and the company. They are the number 1 cosmetic company
good,Worked for a wonderful and kind man. He was generous with his praise and compensation.
good,Fun work environment.
good,"Learn new ideas, meet new people, fun and enjoyable. Plan events and work with other counters. Close family enviroment."
good,"Everyday is different since I am on a traveling team. We usually go in teams around Illinois to different events such as; fashion shows, mall events, and trend shows. I will have clientele and new customers sit in my chair to get a consultation for the entire 8 hour day. During a consultation I try to sell the products I am applying to my client while maintaining a positive conversation and relaxing experience for each person. If an event was slow, I would use my marketing skills to attract new clients to Estee Lauder. If I were to get a new client, they would sit down in my chair and the consulting process would begin. The team includes 15 women, who are all wonderful. The management is great too since we all have similar personalities, and can have fun while we are working. The best part of the job is that the hours are flexible, and establishing relationships with multiple people in the industry, and outside of the industry. The hardest part, which is not a big deal, is traveling to the farthest places from where I live in Illinois."
good,The business is slow and numbers are down for the year. Not to many walk up clients. Most people not spending a lot on cosmetics unless there is a free sample with their purchase.
good,I enjoyed working with my group. we were very close and become a family. My supervisor is an amazing person.
good,"I had a fun time working at Estee Lauder although I was hired as a seasonal position I enjoyed my time as a beauty advisor very much."
good,Everything is about the bottomline but you are surrounded by people who want to meet their goal but also help you meet yours. Fun atmosphere but a lot of work too.
good,I Joy work for estee Lauder  it have a fun environment . There is overtime and I make my hours . They train you but however some time its rush and you are just thrown in the fire. There is a lot to learn but they just need to take there time train better. However it ie still a nice place to work
good,Esperienza importante e molto formativa.Azienda molto seria ed etica
good,"Overall, a lovely place to work.  I was well taken care of but I wasn't challenged (possibly as it was a contract position). My executive was very well respected and very kind, it was a pleasure that we learned from each other."
good,Working there during my time was great however I could not see myself working there in the future as it does not have great potential the longer you work there.
good,"Tienes buenas prestaciones bueno buen sueldo, solo que exigen de más y no apoyan mucho al trabajador"
good,"working as a UK store Designer at Estēe Lauder was an amazing opportunity and a great stepping stone. "
good,I absolutely loved working for Estee Lauder. I was good at my job and the company made me feel like I was needed. MY only issues came from working inside Macy's and the way my particular store was run and managed.
good,Very good environment with a total lack of policy or procedure.  Many companies are excessive in these areas but a total lack of it can be damaging as well.
good,"Good learning experience with one of the top beauty company."
good,Great company to work for but employees can be not that inspiring. Internal move is easy which is great. Differ by brand a lot. Advancement can be challenging.
good,Good brand to work for as they own most popular brands so really good discount on all of them but can be quite unorganised head office and management. Pressure to hit targets and kpis so my advice to get into a busy store will be more enjoyable and make your commission on top of wage. You must be a people person for all types of customer
good,"The company places a premium on culture and is actively trying to modernize to compete with startup brands. There is a lot of dead weight, however. A lot of lifers that just want to plan their next vacation and expect you to do their work for them. Management is typically very slow to address issues and is serially out of touch. Like most things, your opportunities for advancement come down to who you’re connected to, not how well you perform your job duties. Don’t expect to be noticed. Do expect to fight for credit on your work."
good,I loved my position but it was very competitive and stressful. I was the only EL associate at my department store so I handled EVERYTHING. The pay needs to be higher and they need to offer more training in the field.
good,"EL Companies is lean and mean. The pay is okay, the hours are long. There's not a lot of autonomy. It's very bureaucratic. The top people are indecisive."
good,"Work hard, be consistent, honest, positive and want the best for everyone around you/ your team and company. Those around you will see your progress and depending on your manager will acknowledge it, and reward it."
good,Es una empresa donde se le da mucha labor a la mujer y no hay competicion. Las relaciones laborales son sanas.
good,"Wonderful loyal following, easy to sell. Big sales goals and lots of events.  Amazing new product launches often that have a lot of science behind them."
good,"All good fun place to work managment a bit funny hence why I left, culture could be very bithcy but thats retail beauty for you. Good training and benefits"
good,"Estee Lauder is an AMAZING cosmetic company to work for! I felt the training and education was structured, compensation was more than fair, and the expectations and goals were reasonably achievable."
good,I love being a part of the Estee Lauder team as a PA doing makeup artistry and promoting products. The limited hours was fine for me. No benefits but lots of gratis (free products of our choice).
good,"It was a very nice place to work with great benefits. You get $200-$300 worth of free products every quarter which is nice. 3% commission and an additional 1% over the counter when you reach your goals. I just dont care for selling that much. Its more goal oriented than anything. Also my store was very slow, i hate just standing around. The people at my counter always worked well together, never cutthroat but I've heard of others being very competitive."
good,"Great company helping to build strong leaders, but basic Management skills are lacking."
good,"Командная работа, отличная дружеская атмосфера, взаимовыручка."
good,"Great job for summer only especially for students. Able to stay productive and manage my own time and tasks. Learnt to be proactive, gain new experiences, meet new challenges etc."
good,It was an honor to work with such a smart team of people.  The brand is rapidly growing and since my time there we've exceeded our sales growth and have climbed to the top of EMV ranking.
good,"A true brand culture, enjoyed working here a lot- great people great friends - their products are still in my home and many of the people i groomed are still in the cosmetic industry. Overall a great company to work within and for."
good,"A very good company to work for with a lot of career prospects but some management issues within the staff sales department "
good,"It was an okay experience , good first job. "
good,Great culture and work-life balance. Fun environment where peers can transition into friends. Focus on relationship building with co-workers and business partners.
good,It was a very competitive job but had opportunity to grow with the company. I worked at a very small counter so it was hard to meet goals. Overall it was a good company to work for
good,"Empresa multimarca dedicada a la belleza y salud "
good,"Every day I was unsure of where I would be working, there didn't seem to be much communication from management. There also no notice that things were slowing down and that there were layoffs coming (I worked monday and the next day I got an email that I was laid off. I am not angry just disappointed."
good,"Review daily Help desk tickets and provide solutions."
good,"Their makeup is great, for all skin types and all shades, they have a great skincare line. I love doing makeup it's my passion, I ensure my clients have a great customer service experience"

good,"This was a decent place to work for i enjoyed learning about setting up and running the machines in the warehouse, I also enjoyed managing a team of temp workings and assembling with them if need be."
good,Great place to start retail/sales career.  Great to be a part of a large company that give you job stability.  Nice to preview new products before they launch to public.
good,Es war eine gute erfahrung. Ich konnte dabei viel Lernen. Alle konnten gut miteinander umgehen.
good,"Estee Lauder has been a good company overall and is growing tremendously worldwide. "
good,"I worked for estee lauder and the free stuff was seriously amazing!!! we always got a gratis and the products are easy to believe in....the management I had was the worst tho, sometimes people should leave their issues at home"
good,"My working day consists of working out targets for the counter and staff. Building relationships with the customers is key so i spent 90% of my day talking to customers, giving consultations and creating loyalty to the brand. I have gained many skills ftom my time in the role of beauty advisor and counter manager and one thing is building relationships with customers, managerment and staff is key. Everyone should be working for the same cause and should all want to hit targets. I work in a small team where problems can arise but this is mananged by talking to one another and working stragetically with each other. I find that the hours can be unsociable and some times targets are high and at quiet periods of the year these are tricky to meet. I love working with people and making customers feel special. My aim is to make evey woman look and feel her most beautiful and i acheive that, then i have had a good day at work."
good,"A typical day starts with opening the registers, and store meeting."
good,"Fun people to work with, friendly bright atmosphear,"
good,"People were great, sad the the economic crisis hit when it hit."
good,Only downfall was the pay as a temporary employee. Wish I could have stayed longer.
good,Macys is a great company to work for. If you work hard and provide great customer service you can go far. Estee Lauder on the other hand is a harder company to work for. They both pay me half and you can be pulled in too many directions. The pressure to do excellent is draining.
good,Work use to be good until things were cut out. Things got more strict and the management was great the people that I met on a daily basis through the temp agency were nice. I learned a great deal within 17 years of being with the company from being in different areas of the building and doing many different jobs from shipping to production and disturbution.
good,"A typical day a work would to teach customers about their skincare needs "
good,"I enjoed, nice brand, nice products. Loved the training in London and all the free bits , love the customers and makeovers and our discount "
good,"Decent, clean work environment. Salary should be more competitive. More focus should be placed on succession planning and employee promotion to keep employees motivated and rewarded for loyalty and hard work."
good,I would recommend others working for the company because they do offer great incentives. Gratis is given at every training and every 4 months. Trainings are always offered which is nice. Work environment is just too stressful dealing with rude customers all day for very little pay. A yearly assessment and increase is not offered and it should be.
good,Very good stepping stone to get into cosmetics with further education. They help you go in depth with their products and also invest a lot of time to prepare you.
good,"Es una buena empresa, sin embargo la carga de trabajo puede ser excesiva y demandante"
good,"Fast paced and easy to learn, working in a warehouse was pretty clean and organized but will get repetitive after a while, but great people to work with."
good,Estée Lauder provide a lot of coaching to their employees to make sure they well know of the product knowledge and in the same time to built up the confidence of them when deal with customer. Emphasis about team work in order to create a good productivity and harmony working environment between each employees.
good,"Estee Lauder is the best place to start your career as the company is well structured and they believe in the internal talent that they hire. "

good,"Was given great opportunity to slowly return to retail/management world with a fixed schedule & new learning experience of the world of cosmetic. "
good,Attendance is a big part of the company policy that they stick to it.   No cussing or fighting.  No tolerance.    Anything else you will be forgiven.  Good clean environment very professional.
good,The company is ever-changing and restructuring. Many of the things that we used to appreciate are no longer.  I am disappointed with the lack of transparency regarding the future of our jobs.
good,"the trainings were great, they objective was awesome and something that i still stand by. Management isnt as involved as they should be and they really don't move people up from within, at least as far as management goes."
good,belk hours were not good however I enjoyed working for Estee Lauder. lots of room for advancement. The vendor received adequate support from the retailer for events.
good,"the overall culture was good at lauder. there was a diverse and interesting group of people working there."
good,"put on protective clothing, get assigned to specific job on the lines and rotating throughout the day. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and how to use machinery correctly. The hardest part of the job was packing items into boxes whilst the line is running at a fast pace, if this wasn't done correctly then there would be a build up. The most enjoyable bit about this job is being recognised for your hard work and the rewarding benefits."
good,The company offers continuous incentives for targets met. Support and product knowledge is accessible via company training portal.  Uniform and allowances are provided to present a professional image of the company.  Presentation and conduct are to be in accordance with company expectations as set out in the employee guidelines.
good,Great resume builder to work for this firm. They always are looking fore new people. Hard to become permanent working at this firm. Expect a long transition time
good,"I happened to be in a location that was not ideal and that particular store was in turmoil due t lack of leadership and extremely poor management.  In the 12 months I was there, we had 2 GM's and there was constant back-biting.  Not my type of environmentto work."
good,A typical day at work for estee lauder in my store (dillards)  is very slow. Recruiting customers is necessary otherwise you may have a day where you do not sell a single item. Poor communication within management and AC's.
good,"overall positive company to work for"
good,"CCS was exciting, you get to play with make up all day and make people feel great. Plus who isn't excited to be around make up. Loyal customers are a plus!"

good,Estee Lauder Companies are fantastic employers. They provide staff with amazing training and support benefits and the salary you deserve.
good,"- sehr anspruchsvolle Kundschaft"
good,"it is a skincare based line sort of, there is definitely color but you kind of have to work with what you have. Uniforms are great but you do get bored with the same outfit almost everyday."
good,"this company overall good performance that was i toid you in my above job prescription."

good,Helped customer choose from different products by providing them information about each they showed interest.
good,"I would start off by sorting boxes with merchandise in it on a skid for half of the day. The next half I would scan boxes with the scan gun. I would sometimes work in shipping printing lables for boxes and wrapping skids packed with merchandises. "
good,"Estee Lauder has a wonderful training and education program for new makeup artist."
good,"Very hard to describe a ""typical"" day as I did many aspects for the company from organizing offices complete with email training,"
good,"I have acquired a well balanced skill set from working at Estee Lauder Companies . A great company to work for and a mission I truely stand behind.  The people are amazing but leadership can be challenging. Hardest part of the job is that the advancement for growth is very limited. Overall, great place to work!"

good,Was able to advance in company. Started hiring more temps then hourlys. Departments started moving to other states.
good,Global company
good,"I have been  at Estee Lauder for almost 10 years and love working for the company.  They have great benefits and leadership.  The company is also competitive in salary in a tough market.  I have grown tremendously, and have been mentored by many great leaders."
good,"Great please to work."
good,"Contractors/consultants are treated as though they are disposable but eventually if they do want to bring you on full time you are treated like gold. "
good,Where I worked I had to call the shelves to me and restock them from the receiving bay. It was long and fast paced. The other workers there were great to be around.
good,I learned a lot while working at Dillard's. I would definitely go back to work at Estee Lauder for sure. It was fun to have a goal to meet everyday. Not to mention the people I interacted with on a daily basis.
good,Heavy customer involvement on the floor but fun. We preform free mini facials in hopes increasing sales. Management could've been more organized and more respectful to employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unnecessary drama sometimes. Learning the product knowledge and bouncing ideas and facts off of customers and employees about the nature filled ingredients in the products.
good,I learned how to work as a team.  The enjoyable part of working there was the diverse cultures and meeting new people.  The hardest part of the job was waiting for a machine to be fixed when it broke down and finding someone to be put on the line when a line was short. The management was very helpful and friendly.
good,"buena empresa con oportunidad de crecimiento profesional, y oportunidad de cursos profesionales para desarrollo personal, beneficios exclusivos y buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Fast paced environment working with the Estée Lauder creative department while managing relationships with beauty editors.  Worked on press releases to introduce the latest makeup, skincare and fragrance for magazine and newspaper articles."

good,"I throughly enjoyed working for Estée Lauder. I was disappointed after finding that my part time position would not allow me to take time I needed for maternity leave, so I resigned. To this day, I miss my job and my coworkers but I am grateful for the experience!"

good,"High paced department.  I was constantly exposed to many new projects.  Had the best of managers.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with the new culture, which has been changing in the last couple of years."
good,"Great place to be. Need to take your career into your own hands and not rely on others if you are looking for advancement."
good,"Needs to work on work life balance !"
good,"Most days are slow and consist of managing calendars. However, I'm losing skills that I thought I'd be using on the job based on what I was told at my interview. There aren't as many external or internal projects to work on with in the company to explore other areas of the company.  People on my team don't offer support to try other things than what your job lays out for you to do."
good,"Estee Lauder cares that their Beauty Advisors and Managers receive all the support possible. Though this position allows you to be occassionally creative, you are mainly there serve your clientele, make sales and beat last year's numbers."
good,"Estee Lauder, specifically, Clinique is a company I very proud to work for because of the dedication to their employees overall growth and development.  Clinique cultivates each employee for advancement through consistent and on-going training whether it's in store or at a seminar."

good,My time working at the Estee Lauder was an amazing experience. I learned a lot from working in different environment and working with different people. It was an exciting way to gain more knowledge from this company and I appreciate the company for allowing me gain experience.
good,"A typical day at work included helping customers find what they wanted in skincare and makeup. I learned that everyone's skin is different and that I want to help them find what they need. The workplace culture was good, sometimes overwhelming. The hardest part of the job was making sales being a part-timer. The most enjoyable part of the day was making my clients happy."
good,"I worked in various positions: counter manager, resident makeup artist, and promotional assistant. Expectations were high for sales and service but the pay with commissions was great compared to most retail jobs, Lauder also provides many incentives for achieving sales goals.The training seminars were informative and fun with lots of free new products. We also got hundreds of dollars in gratis toward products of our choice. I learned a lot about successful marketing from this top cosmetics company."
good,"I was a consultant hired on a per-project basis in the creative department. I enjoyed working with the department manager. It was a very professional yet friendly atmosphere. There is not too much I can say as I was there as a consultant and therefore was only interacting with a select group of people in the design department."
good,"It was a really great and friendly place to work. We worked hard, but we had fun too. They outsourced to India to save money (which turned out to be a mistake according to people who still work there).  It was a really great environment.  My manager was cool.  She got promoted and one of our coworkers was promoted to the new manager.  She was nice too.  Overall, great place to work, but we were considered consultants and did not get any benefits or employee perks."
good,"Good for working in long term, good human resource management, management thinks about individuals development in skills, people will appreciate you for good work and give enough chance to correct your mistakes"
good,A typical day at work would be for me to get to my  counter and try to finish my inventory. I had to gut out the entire counter and reorganize it after the other counter manager left. I honestly couldn't get the time to help my customers that need help with Estee purchases because I was always stuck ringing out customers with retail purchases.
good,I liked this company and my manager who was very understandable. I got a chance to learn about POINT OF SALES  systems and tablets in the retail environment. I have learned a lot.
good,I enjoyed  working  their it was very fast paced. Work with always available. The mangers  were kind very helpful also friendly. Met a lot of friendly employees  to work  with that were very helpful .I would
good,"A good company to work for, you need to be physically fit t o work in the warehouse as you are walking/on your feet all day.  Good camaraderie, easy to learn, variety if you want it."
good,"A Estee Lauder é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, apesar do dia a dia muito corrido dado a estrutura pequena da filial no Brasil sempre me senti muito envolvida pela missão da empresa."
good,Work is very exciting and challenging.  The people are great and that proved to be a great work environment.  Flexible days off during the summer months and holidays off in the winter
good,"Working at Estee Lauder has provided me with the tools necessary to commit myself to rigorous yet a disciplined time table.working 5 days a weekm 7am to 3pm (if overtime was not implicated that week). working as a production assistant, you're not only working with people of the same job obligations but you are also accompanied by experts in management such as quality control, that facilitate team work that is important for meeting the day to day goals assigned for mass production within the working unit."
good,"In Estee Lauder si lavora bene, è un'azienda comunque molto esigente."
good,The people are just wonderful and I learned so many new things. The environment really enables growth and open dialog. The company has excellent benefits and perks that just enhance the already great work experience.
good,I really enjoyed working for Estee Lauder. I was able to transfer to different stores when I moved because I was a military wife. I love cosmetics and helping people so it was the perfect job for me.
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, muito profissional, sabe reconhecer seus funcionários e suas contribuições."
good,Estee lauder allowed me the opportunity to part time hours allowing me to work a few days a week while being a stay at home mom.  A plus to this position is you really learn the importance of client books and how to reach out to customers
good,"Although you sometimes get into a place where you feel stuck, ELC is a great company to work for.  The benefits are great,  the employees are great to work for and with.  My only challenge is moving up in the company."
good,"Estee Lauder is a great company to work for. As a mid-level employee, they have been are more than willing to grow me and teach me the ins and outs of the beauty industry. "
good,I had to package all goods provided by estee lauder in boxes and package the in properly for them to be ready. I had to follow daily procedures and maintain work safety.

good,"Assisted customers in selecting products suitable for their skin care needs."
good,"All my jobs i have met wonderful role models, whom have trained me "
good,"This is a wonderful work place, if you're interested in branching out to Human Resources and or IT.  A typical day will have much calendar management for senior level staff, light travel management and occasional run for lunches.  My co-workers are very polite and helpful (a huge perk to working here).  The only challenge is working an entry level position (Clerk fashioned duties) when you've been working as an Executive Assistant for many years.  It's really a good job for a college or Junior Assistant.  Overall a very nice place to work."
good,Busy typical working days.  Learned about corporate environment.  Management are professional.  Co-workers are team players.  Hardest part was the beautiful cosmetic products.  The most enjoyable was the beautiful products.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working closely with my regular customers, at Estee Lauder we pride ourselves in making our customers look and feel more beautiful and with our great products and my makeup expertise I completed this successfully each day at work. I have also learned to manage people and a small team I have trained them in every aspect of the job but most importantly giving first class customer service. I love to work at part of a team I would plan events on counter and create activity with my consultant and set goals to achieve targets I get lots of satisfaction by planning and completing targets. I am highly motivated and pro active but the hardest part of my job was when the store would be particularly quiet and there would be a low foot fall of customers I had to get out there and make the most of that negative situation and be pro active. A typical day for me at work would be to plan my goals and achieve whatever target I had set myself and my team, have appointments booked and sit my customers down always approaching new customers and building my client profile."
good,fast paced..controlled production lines friendly coworkers that i worked with for 13 years
good,"is a nice place to work as far as the job requires, and also the management are not well connected in communication wise but they try to make it happen and is a fun place to work."
good,This was a fun job. I learned a lo of customer service and management skills. The hardest part of my job was being constanly under staffed.
good,"Carrying a bright smile and clean presentation through my friendly nature helps form an amiable atmosphere most everywhere I go. Being a sales representative consisted of creating the most pleasurable experience for her through immediate assistance, creating a conversation, and having ample product knowledgeable. Estee Lauder is such a prestigious line and offered powerful results to customers through the power of engagement with the customer through conversation about either her outfit, simply the weather, or the latest on fashion news. A typical day consisted of greeting and asserting the needs of each immediate customer, clerical duties, clientele chart keeping, answering the phone, emailing clients and my Regional Cosmetic Merchandisers, reporting to store manager Mondays on sales, promotional events, 3 to 4 facials and makeovers, opening credit cards, setting up innovative merchandising displays, and ultimately executing sales goals."

good,"更高管理層較難體會底層員工，評論傾鈄中間管理層，不夠公平。"
good,"Work is really fast paced and productive. You've got to think off the top of your head and come up with quick solution. Once you get the hang of it, it can be fun. Night shift is very difficult and hard to get out into day shift. 10 hour work days turn into 12-13 if you have to show up to a meeting. Other than that, it was a great place to work."
good,"It was a great experience in the beginning, as the nature of retail changed and the competition heightened in the area and with the emergence of online shopping becoming more dominant, the culture of the company changed. It worried less about the quality of people that were joining the company it didn't spend enough time listening to the employees that had been through the changes and were making recommendations for things to improve. Rather than reinvest in education and building current teams, they were outsourcing and looking for ways to find fault in why business was down on the people rather than the bad business decisions. Overall I saw many good people leave, and many people stay because it is a reputable company... and that's it."
good,"third shift hours were over whelming but you gotta get the job done and make sure you put out the best product for consumer value. people are great to work with, fast pace job but with great pride kn the finished product"

good,Estee Lauder was a fun and great place to work at. I got to meet new people everyday. I learned how to apply makeup. I even brought some for myself and family.
good,Estee Lauder if an innovative company to work for at if you like selling in new products.  It takes a lot of time doing their market research to meet the ever changing needs of its customers.

good,It's important to be target driven and passion for sales .Be prepared to work retail hours and be able to work under pressure.Great benefits of trainings and the perks of using the products
good,"EL is a great company to work for, I would say only if you are single. Married and have kids is kind of hectic to keep up with the pace and hrs to complete your work for the day."
good,"Typical work day was applying makeup and advising on beauty and skincare products. Learned a lot about makeup and fragrance. Hardest part was building up you clientele at first, but it becomes better."
good,"Going to work is never really a problem. Some days you're overworked and the compensation received doesn't match the work completed. Other than that it's a nice environment with music playing, and friendly people"
good,"Always quick to do something and be smart in controlling the customer's condition with always tolerate partners to achieve good sales targets.."
good,Great! Fun job! Not enough hours at my position though. It's better at higher positions because you receive more perks!  I am just freelancing because I just had a baby.
good,Servicing customers through retail sales of cosmetics along with ongoing makeup applications. Learned patience and excellent customer service skills/balance. Very upbeat culture related to the world of beauty and fashion. Not really a hard part because I loved my job. Most enjoyable part of my day was customer satisfaction and empowering women to feel confident about their beauty from the inside/out
good,"Always give your BEST customer service."
good,"Wonderful cosmetic line to work with. Training is extremely thorough, and what you learn from the company in sales, beauty/cosmetic knowledge, and business practice is amazing. Loved it!"
good,"This company is big but they cutting up the commission so making the worker work so hard to earn more money, "
good,I've worked with for this company for many years and in multiple areas. They are always willing to work with you if your schedule or location changes. Great training and great managers.
good,"Would work 5 days a week. In a very stressful environment, would always go above and beyond for guest. "
good,It's a good place of work well organised and very clean place. It has a friendly environment and a lot of leaders around to talk to its a good reliable job with good income

good,"typical day:"
good,great fun place to work with lots of perks. discounts and free gifts for going the extra mile and exceeding the companies expectations.
good,"I loved my time working for Clinique. I learned so much in such a short amount of time and the company felt fun and motivating. My only complaint would be the management being fairly unresponsive- area managers and higher up prefer to ignore problems rather than address them, focusing only on the positive."
good,de dagen gingen snel voorbij. vele leuke collega's en ook de ploegbazen deden enorm hun best. het werk was ook leuk en soms ook wel afwisselend.
good,Fast paced and flexible work days. High energy and positive management team. Great communication among leaders and staff. Continued training and investment in employees.
good,"Reasonable pay and benefits but don't expect much. Also, the marketing department is always the most prestigious child of the company."
good,"If you are a makeup enthusiast like me, this may be a great job to get your foot in the door of the beauty industry, but not a place for you to necessarily show your creative makeup skills. The sales goals were very strict, and when you work in a mall that is not that busy and for a short shift, it is very difficult to meet those goals. My coworkers were very fair and honest and not at all cutthroat, despite it being a commissioned job. The hardest part of this job by far was PRE-SELLING THE FREE GIFT WITH PURCHASE. Pre-selling started a few weeks after my first day on the sales floor. As you can imagine, I hadn't had a good clientele that new me and my name. As a new BA, with not that many clients of your own, it was very difficult to get customers to shop with me over the phone. I honestly think that with a better set of circumstances I could've stuck it out with this job, though."
good,It is a nice place to work and there is a lot of information to learn. There is a nice environment and the people are all friendly and pleasant to work with.
good,"A typical day included the procurement of goods and services for internal and external customers, also, worked diligently to satisfy the needs of internal customers.  I recognized that it is sometimes difficult to satisfy all customers, however, keeping customers updated and having a dialogue helped to improve and build collegial  relationships.  The majority of my colleagues were respectful and supportive.  The most difficult aspect of the job was when suppliers were not able to meet their demands.  It was very satisfying when my colleagues and Sr. Management were pleased with my job performance."
good,"beautiful products and stuff."
good,"Excelelnt company to work. Stable work force focused on objects, good temwork."

good,typical day at work was two or three line set-up.learned to work on new equipment. management on nights was great to work for. co-workers great bunch of people to work along side of. hardest part of my job was not always have the part you need to fix your equipment. new friends you make over the years your there and new equipment you get to work on.

good,"great environment"
good,"Estee Lauder is an excellent company in terms of the work culture, you have an excellent work-life balance with the option to work for just 4.5 days per week in the summers. You get a lot of make up at great discounts, and sometimes even free as gratuity. They really value their employees. The management team however is quite hands off so if you're self motivated, its fine, though sometimes you feel that there is no direction from management at all."
good,"A very good company to work for. and fun area to work at.  the factory, was loaded with heavy machinery. I worked there during the Summer.  I had to get my shoes to wear at work."
good,"Working for the Estee Lauder Companies always kept me on the go. With new, innovative products regularly being introduced to keep up with changes in trends and society."
good,"There are many positions, each with different tasks. Everyone works together for best production. The safety team includes physical therapists onsite. Some days double shift of 4 hours each is available of the three shifts also some Saturday work. Everything gets recognized, whether or not announced. As long as you do the job, you're good."

The job is highly matrixed and involved working with difficult personalities in a positive and productive manner.
good,"Estee is filled with ambitious and intelligent people.  Most employees have been there for a VERY LONG time and will tell you it is an amazing place to work.  As a younger employee, I find the culture lacking and the dynamics a bit dull.

good,"j'ai travaillée en mai 2016 en intérim pour Estee Lauder et ce fût"
good,"When I first started this position I was unaware of everything it entailed.  I new very little about the beauty, cosmetic, skincare industry.  The store manager at the time talked me into the position because I was looking for full time work.  This position created a self confidence I would not have had.  I learned everything in a very quick time.  I learned how to do makeovers, the art of applying make-up.  I had to keep inventory levels so we never ran out of products.  I scheduled the breaks for my people and kept track of productivity.  I set everyone's daily goals.  I created events to attract customers.  My team and I enjoyed wonderful productivity.  We all worked retail hours, closing some nights and having to open the next day.  I was in charge of balancing the register and signing in the days proceeds.  I lead my team to becoming the first team to reach 1 million dollars (at our location) in sales for a given year, while being the second highest in productivity.  I would travel to Pittsburgh monthly for management meetings.  And I also went to meetings for new products and continuing education.  I was able to help women feel good about themselves, helped men find that perfect gift for their lady.  I also helped young girls learn how to apply their own make-up.  I taught people the need for skincare and trained all new beauty reps. We had a wonderful camaraderie at work."
good,"Always recruiting, teaching and learning about new products. Developing sale plans for the month to achieve at least 6% increase in sales from last year.

My role has flexible hours and the ability to work from home on specific days so the work life balance can not even come close to other companies.

good,"Shifts are 4 hours long and its required to work at least 12 hours a week providing that your team color is working at a particular week. This job is easy but fast paced and accuracy is very important. Because employees handle materials that costumers would use in their body/face on a daily basis, employees handling materials must wear gloves and hairnets at all times and must keep workstations clean and free of clutter. Lead assemblers or line attendants have a bigger responsibility because they have to provide the assemblers with all the materials needed on the assembly line. Assemblers are not allowed to leave the line because it doesn't stop. I really enjoyed working for this job because the shifts are short and you can volunteer to stay another 4 hour shift if your team colors are working and you get paid weekly.  Additionally, managers are courteous and very respectful to employees. Even when the demand for products are high and facility is experiencing a lot of pressure to get work done  fast and accurately."

I learned all the different types of things so many people want and use that I had no clue about before beginning my job. My manager and my fellow co-workers and I was all quite close; inside and outside of work. The hardest part was when I would get that certain customer that no matter what they ask and want you have, but that's not what they are talking about and it was. The discount and Birthday Gratis was awesome, but what I most enjoyed was working with the public."

My management during the internship strived to help me learn the in's and the out's of the manufacturing industry, but also wanted me to see the passion behind the work as well. With tours of a few manufacturing brand sites by Estee Lauder, getting to experience working at the Philadelphia office as well as the high paced New York office, I felt like I was given opportunities that I couldn't have gotten at many other companies as an intern. The hardest part at my time at Estee Lauder was not a negative; it was learning to drown the nervousness and build my confidence to open myself up during conference calls, meetings, and when presenting to associates from other parts of the world."

good,"A typical day at work is filled with exciting things, because its in an exciting environment, the products sell themselves. Its the beauty industry and who does not want to look beautiful. The fun part is that I got paid and very well at that, to make women feel good about themselves and their purchases. I would travel to various retail stores to set up for Beauty events, which included signage, tables, product, and worked along with the team at the store to sell product. Management had a very good way of difusing any stress and pressure to perform, because everyone wore a beauty smile and made it work as a team effort, and the sales goals were exceeded. There was a good vibe amongst the coworkers, mutual respect for each other. The hardest part of the job was felt at the end of the work day when you got home, after the rush of excitement and the shoes came off from the long hours on your feet. But in the beauty business you should know what to do to bounce back just as bright and beautiful the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing a very satisfied customer, have a high sales day at the events that exceeded goals."
