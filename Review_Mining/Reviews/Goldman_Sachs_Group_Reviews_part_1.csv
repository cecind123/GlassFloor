rating,review
bad,"Should have left sooner.  The company is trying to reinvent itself by becoming a regular ol' bank.  Yep, that's the grand plan...  The trading division is mostly dried up, and so the intellectual challenge of creating new interesting securities is just gone."
bad,Perfect for those who don't have life and enjoys working for a modern sweatshop under the direction of obedient imbeciles.  Nice view on the outside world.
bad,"Goldman is not a place for people of diverse background to get a sense of belonging and thrive. Too much racism, discrimination and prejudice. If you are white male you will be fine."
bad,"This is about the worst job anybody can work in.. the manager swears at everybody, they want you to work very long hours and the only 2 good things are the 2 front desk receptionists,"
bad,0 work life balance . You are treated like a school kid . They expect you to be on time at 10 am  Nothing wrong with it.But Attendance is sent out to entire management if you come to office at 10.01 am . Salt lake city office .
bad,"Bad morale"
bad,"Goldman Sachs is truly one of the most backbreaking, soul crushing companies that I have ever had the misfortune to work with. I would never recommend working with them if you could help it. They will use everything at their disposal to to degrade and belittle you into accepting payment much lower than was agreed to and nickle and dime every penny they can. Avoid."
bad,"Place is horrible to work at, management abuses employees and is replacing them with H1 Visa staff at a cheaper rate.  There is no future here. The place is a revolving door and management attitude is ""We just need to find the right culture to work here"" rather than address the problems."
bad,"A typical work day includes getting into the office, checking emails, and completing reviews. "
bad,"they are large corporation so its hard to be seen , you have to work hard and go above and beyond to be visible. Benefits are good , they have great package that's why people stick around"
bad,"I worked for them for 7 years and then was summarily laid off in 2008 along with ten percent of the rest of the work force.  Without fail, everyone in my division who was laid off was a female admin over 45 years old or someone who had been ill and used ""too much"" sick time.  To get severance package we were required to sign an agreement stating we would not sue for age discrimination.  "
bad,Vary long hours. management does not take time to developemloyees for advancement. I enjoyed each one of my co workers. we were all willing ot help a peer when necessary.
bad,"small company"
bad,"Learned to multi-task, to connect globally, to network - some of the opportunities are remarkable"
bad,The company froze employees raises and there were no benefits
bad,Run away from these a**holes as soon as you can.  All this company is worried about is making lots and lots of money at any cost.  If you make money for them you will be treated like a god.  If you are on the cost side you are treated a lot differently. Lots of internal politics.  If you really really do want to work for these jerk offs make friends in high places as soon as possible.  You have been warned.
bad,Not at all concerned about the employee just the bottom line.  They will set you to do a few tasks and that is your life with them going forward.  It was just a terrible experience.
bad,"Management is monstrous and employees are not valued at all. Either generate revenue or get out, there is no room for growth and development unless you are willing to compromise on integrity and crush over other colleagues"
bad,"This business has no idea what it really wants to achieve.  There was a mandate to improve revenues and client impact but no reliable roadmap and any suggestions that ran counter to how the business manages to that mandate were dismissed.  If the definition of ""crazy"" is to repeat the same behaviors while expecting a different result, this business can be defined as such.  Senior management is more political than can be imagined and seems to exist solely for its own well-being (ie, promotion and pay)."
bad,"Goldman is not for the weak.  Although I worked 100 hours a week, my compensation did not reflect it.  The organization was still run like a partnership, highly political and clublike,"
bad,It’s good for the title of working at Goldman Sachs. They will treat you like dirt. Will drop your contract at the end of the season with no humanity and no warning. The management sucks and the loyalty is non existent. Really no hard feelings but just prepare yourself for a miserable time in operations.
bad,"- Recommended for two years only as it opens a lot of doors "
bad,"Stay away! This is a career killer, and they don’t pay nearly enough commensurate with the garbage that we put up with. Managers conspire to keep analysts low paid with no bonusses"
bad,"It was my first job and I learnt a lot here. One can attain good international exposure. There are monthly and quarterly meetings on the work updates with senior management.However, the working hours are crazy in most of the departments and there is no work life balance."
bad,Professionals will be worked to the grind with little consideration for effective work life balance.  Employees burn and churn and rarely stay more than 3 years when they find a culture that lets you live your life.
bad,The Firm does not invest in talented people. Compensation was not adequate and the firm did not promote well internally nor did it foster an environment of teamwork and mobility.
bad,"A place full of back stabbing and dirty politics. Veterans indulge into unethical acts to make sure new hires never get stabilized in their work and finally leave the place in frustration. "
bad,poor management. Lack substance. not a good place to work. extremely superficial approach.  Very mechanical processes that are outdate and not efficient
bad,"If you are looking for a place that will take every ounce of you it can and then expect that and more to get ahead this is your place.  If you want to work long hours in an extremely fast paced environment for poor managers and extremely low pay for the effort required this is also your place.  Don't ever let them tell you they're a meritocracy because advancement is extremely political and not based on ability at all.  If you can make your managers think you're awesome, whether you are or not you'll be fine."
bad,"Goldman is a great place for 2 years but after that you need to leave. They increase your salary 5% each year the first few years then they stop increasing it."
bad,It is not easy to move roles. Compensation is not comparable to competitors. Management does not live up to corporate values. Standard corporate environment where humor and vitality is lacking. Soul Crushing is appropriate.
bad,There is no work life balance. Contingent workers having worst time of their life. Legacy system working on oldest technologies possible. Not recommended.
bad,"Regardless of how much work the employees put in the table, they're always expected more. The compensation packages sometimes don't justify the amount of effort put in. Sometimes, bad bosses will take credit of your work and ignore your efforts."
bad,"Consultant for major acquisitions at the"
bad,"Expectations are to put in lots of hours, network, delegate work, have little to no work-life balance, and accommodate as much as possible.  Layoffs are frequent, advancement is not guaranteed, and management doesn't seem to care if you succeed or not.  Success here depends on hours worked, networking, lower pay for a while, timing & a bit of luck."
bad,"My boss was a sexist, egotistical, narcissist that put everyone down that was not above him.  I was very happy to leave that place. "
bad,"Toxic politics. Deplorable manager behavior is acceptable. Extremely poor management. Lack of Culture. Benefits are good but expensive. Office cafeteria is expensive, food isn't good. Location is not ideal. Office is void of character."
bad,Software engineers aren't treated fairly. Life at work is horrible overall and to top everything their comp giveaways aren't based on performance but on attracting new employees without first taking care if those who already work there.
bad,"1- Micro-managemt"
bad,"Very political place to work. Long hours no work life balance. I worked there for 15 years got pushed out in effort to ""restructure"" this happened to many employees who were more senior. However if you want to make good money and devote your life to the firm its a good place to work."
bad,"You are just a number, and everything you do and say is recorded, everything is a metric. People are scared of the management, and will quickly stab you in the back."
bad,"A typical day was on average ten to twelve hours a day.  You are constantly told that if you work hard, you will get a bonus and a promotion.  I never saw either of these come to fruition during my two years. "
bad,"TMT in SF culture is notoriously the worst within all of GS. I was told that many times but I didn't believe it until I moved into the group. People are elitist, racist, sexists, and quite homophobic."
bad,"Offers decent work experience.  Like other major banks, rather dull and more interested in preserving status quo than in leading the push toward innovation in the financial services industry."
bad,"A very difficult place to succeed, as management is NOT invested in your growth."
bad,There is no proper structure. Things almost seem like they are based a lot on preference than rules. Training was great. No fault to their team. they're very good. Management is very poor. Improper communication across the board. All the managers had different ideas as to what was correct procedure and information was not shared properly to agents on calls. I would have rated 0 if it let me. Awful workplace.
bad,"Nepotism, unfair wage discrepancies, poor management from the top down. Great to have Goldman on your resume, but other than that a very bad experience."
bad,management at gsam is horrible.  they promote sycophants not people who know what they are doing.  managers don't respect anyone beneath them because they only suck up to anyone who can get them promoted.  Managers are quick to take credit for projects they never participated in nor do they know how it works.  These same managers are quick to throw anyone under the bus when issues arise.
bad,Good opportunity to learn and work with fortune 500 executives.  If you don't want to be an account manager you're wasting your time here.  Very good pay if you can make it to account manager level.
bad,"The company claims a casual work environment, highlighting diversity and inclusivity but is nothing close to that behind operating doors. Management operates at an ‘all for one’ rather than ‘one for all’ capacity. Turnover rate is ridiculous, so it’s no wonder the company is always hiring."
bad,"Hectic work, no incentives, no hikes and delay in salary credits."
bad,Good work and great learning .People are professional and company policies are employees friendly.Work pressure is too much. Good professional growth.
bad,Very competitive which makes the culture unbearable. There is no break room. You eat lunch at your desk everyday. No work/life balance. Managers do not have the proper training to lead the team.
bad,"Promotions and advancement are based on who you know rather than any work ethic or achievements. Very complicated office politics, managers have free reign to treat employees however they see fit with no rules or consequences. Harassment is constant and never fully addressed when reported. They will work you hard and give nothing in return."
bad,the analyst are asked to give up their lives to keep the place running while management leaves mid day and is never around when the team needs help with basic tasks.
bad,Manager was creepy—he was paranoid that everyone was out to get him.  He is no longer there.  This was back in ‘94/‘95.  The world was much different back then and people got away with too much.
bad,There is an inherant belief inside the company that working at Goldman Sachs is everyone's dream job and that being there will be the absolute pinnacle of your career.
bad,Working there was not a great experience. Part the presentation team there was little respect towards my team. For those reasons I would not want to work there ever again
bad,"stressful working environment, competitive culture, some really good managers and some really arrogant juniors, people are insecure and work long hours."
bad,"The company does not have a good work and life balance, all employees work very long hours and the salaries do not account for that. There is lots of politics which makes it hard to build trustworthy relationship and feel secure in the working environment."
bad,"The Marcus division must hire a collection of people that other employers cant get rid of fast enough...or something. Because I have never seen such a collection of pointlessly competitive and toxic people in any workplace I've been in before.""Collaborate"" is a huge buzzword here but that's mostly all it is. Employees usually stay about a year then move on to other employers. O.k place for people straight out of school that need some experience or those with no other options."
bad,if you thrive under pressure its for you. office culture is not the same as compared to other investment banks. prepare for lots of office politics. would only recommend for the name on resume
bad,"Goldman Sachs will work you like a dog and does not provide adequate mentorship for new hires. If you want to get promoted, you need to play their political games."
bad,Perfect for a single person who has no family.  The higher you go the more politics you encounter.  Many silos.  If you become a parent in Goldman you have a 10 year shelf life.  There is no job security unless you are either brown nosing or no outside life.
bad,They say they want you to succeed but if you don't play the political game you won't be progressing in your career. Day to day job is really not what your review is based on.
bad,"Long days with long hours, very New York centric company, no local decision making in Asia, all decisions needed late night calls and approvals from NY, expected to check emails till 10pm each night."
bad,"if you get in the right group the career opportunity might be there, otherwise internal transfers are very difficult, internal job boards don't work, you can only move internally through personal connections"
bad,"Some nights the workload is hectic, especially with bankers who tried to meet deadlines in 3 hours. Pay is great but be careful of co-workers who are struggling day-time actors...testy."
bad,As an employee you are expected to attend social events with company representatives to ever be considered for advancement.  There is no balance for work life and you won't get promoted if you don't attend the events.
bad,"Port management, communication, structure and culture."
bad,Unless you have worked there all your career they treat all outsiders poorly and even relish abusing them and reminding them daily that 'you do not belong'. It should be illegal to hire people with the expressed intent of solely seeing if they have any useful information then canning them as soon as the download is complete. I suspect that a lot of these people were bullied at school and actually not that many are particularly bright - just devious.
bad,"Super fast paced environment, one person works for three there. All the glamour and prestige is a decoy for people to work like horses. People are very fake and cut throat."
bad,"Empresa difícil para trabalhar, pois não segue a própria cultura que está no papel."
bad,"- Great learning opportunities"
bad,Had to get up the curve incredibly quickly. You are expected to take responsibility for yourself and your learning. There is a good level of support from your team but you must take initiative.
bad,This company has a lot of growing to do. They have to find a way to develop its employees. This is a crucial part of career development. The retirement plan is not the best
bad,"GS is a hard place to work.  You will learn a lot.  You will learn how to navigate corporate entities.  You will learn how to be a professional, picking up skills along the way.  Culturally, it's hard.  To me, it wasn't worth it as I wasn't passionate about the work I was doing.  Great to have on your resume if you can stick it out though."
bad,A typical day at work was long and very stressful. I learned how to manage my time and build relationships. The hardest part of the job was managing through the politics.
bad,I have worked in the commodities field for the last 12 years focusing on natural gas and electricity. I've held various trading and sales roles during my tenor and I have developed many key relationships during this time.
bad,"lots of work, pressure and intense environment requiring lots of long hours"
bad,Work is interesting but talent at the management level is poor. No career advancement and directions.
bad,"Number-crunching and data-entry. Pay was reasonable for NYC, but we worked hard. Least favorite part had to be the 30-minute at-the-desk lunch breaks."
bad,"You learn a lot but need to work around the clock ... a lot of politics. "
bad,"They just want us to work all day and night long. I could not do it for so long, so I had to find a place where I could live a little bit. Other than that!"
bad,Pathetic work culture. Manager was good for nothing. No work life balance. No learning opportunity. They only like operational mindset people. No scope for good Quant folks
bad,NO matter your tenure or time with the company you are always on the hot seat. Not really a place to grow or develop yourself unless the skills you are looking for are corporate bureaucracy. Also plan on a minimum of a 55 hour work week.
bad,"Coming from a different world; which is healthcare, I was surprised to see the difference in culture. Although, I was in the medical department of this company, it was no different than any other corporate world. The characteristics displayed with ""white glove"" treatment to certain individuals went totally against all I believed in healthcare. I was always trained to deliver optimal care to everyone; regarless of your position; income, gender or race. Here, I realized it was much different."
bad,"Career Progression is a big concern."
bad,"GS is a large investment bank. When I worked for them they were true to their stereotype, poor work/life balance with long hours required. The people are great, management is talented. The work however is not done very efficiently."
bad,"Whilst GS has great number of smart and motivated people, the firm is not good at rewarding people based on the work input and performance. This firm gives me an impression that value of diligence and hard-working is not appreciated.  This place also lacks transparency in decision-making; delegation and decision making is purely done at senior management level without incorporating feedback from people at lower level regardless of abundance in knowledge."
bad,"Firm is very good to work for, excellent benefits , latest technology."
bad,"a lot of work, non stop and people not that nice. learn about presentation skills, working in an office environment and how not to care about anything apart from paycheck!"
bad,"Company culture is really good in NY and rest of world except India ."
bad,"Technology division really lagging behind others."
bad,Typical day is developing new stuff in java/SQL and interactions with the users for the application development.
bad,- Good Name for people who are not working there. When you say GS people think it's a really amazing place to work for. Most people are very nice.
bad,"Unreachable goals, poor management, micromanaging, do not be enticed by the pretty salary you will never make more money and never be advanced all you will do is be run into the ground trying to abide by illogical rules"
bad,Lack of workplace flexibility especially through life events for people on visa . High turnover at junior levels however  still a meritocracy . Lack of diversity in certain offices
bad,"Goldman certainly has a reputation for being a great place to develop your career but that really comes with caveats."
bad,not focussed on engineers career development. there is very less to learn on today's technology. Life event changes are supported well. Networking is highly preferred more than skill at job.
bad,Working in Goldman as an intern should be an amazing experience. But the culture here is a little bit fake. People pretend to care you a lot but actually not.
bad,"They make consultants compete for a permanent position. The pay is high, but they will squeeze every penny's worth from you. Their systems use a proprietary language that was derived from Java, called Slang. No real IDE to code your changes."
bad,"There is not much to talk about this company as I didn't work long in that company at all. As a consultant, I felt the culture is very different from the telecomm company where I worked before."
bad,"The culture of this company demands excellence. Unfortunately without formal performance metrics this measure is often subjective and different depending on each manager. Experience and exposure with this company is invaluable and if given an opportunity to work for them,it should be given serious consideration. Understand that you will be in a high stress high pressure environment. If you are OK with that you will do well."
bad,"At the time of this review, I still work here."
bad,"There is high turnover and a lot of times there is low morale. A decent place to start your career, but most people do not last long."
bad,How you like the company depends on what your career goals are. While I was there face-time was the rule so if you left work at the 10hr mark (a normal day) you were the recipient of sarcastic remarks about not having enough work to do. Management was quietly expected to spend even more time at the office that increased with title. Work/life balance slanted heavily towards work despite what upper management said.
bad,"If you want to work somewhere where no one speaks to you informally, everyone spends 12 hours a day in meetings or staring at their screen, and there is an overly competitive work culture - go ahead"
bad,"You can work your heart out, but good luck getting rewarded it. You may get a pat on the back, but that's it. Advancement is VERY rare which is frustrating because when a spot becomes available in another department, literally everyone is competing for it. Communication is very lackluster, and down right frustrating at times."
bad,"Typical day at work started from 12 noon, extending till the 10 PM, sometimes midnight. Claustrophobic office space is an issue as well as the work load which is quite taxing. It is a big challenge to keep up with the pace at GS, not necessarily the most rewarding in terms of pleasure though."
bad,GS is a giant in the financial industry and it shows in how they treat their employees; big or small. Great pay and benefits with good work-life balance as well.
bad,"daily work load is good ,  management is US based and so difficult to build close relationships. which leads to little career development."
bad,Its an amazing place to start your career in but as a person gets mature in life sometimes you need to find a work life balance which unfortunately does not exsist here as of yet .
bad,"Was extremely excited about working here, training was absolutely brilliant. Enough time was given for all the information and the trainers were hands down the best part about it. I wish I could say the same about the management. If you would like to go into a company where all management have clear favourites this is the place for you. For a professional company as this the management really does not come up to scratch."
bad,"N/A - I don't want to write a review here of the company and It has been long since I worked there. In general, the company is great and merit based entirely which I love."
bad,Very challenging and demanding environment.  Company now is heavily focusing on extreme automation and trying to eliminate routine workforce from the environment to meet customers expectation.
bad,"its a bank . I was told "" doesnt matter if u do amazing work you need to network and someone else needs to vouch for u and say he is good, so thats more important"""
bad,"Long hours, not much intermingling with other groups (including those that sit a few rows away from you). Management is very numbers driven."
bad,"My biggest problem with working at Goldman Sachs is the amount of time required to be worked there. I was only a temp and I was still required to work 10 hours a day. I enjoyed the team environment there. The team would get together outside of work, which made every day at work more fun."
bad,"There were very good benefits, and occasional technical auditorium presentations. They open layout was hit or miss depending on who was nearby- could be insanely loud and annoying."
bad,"Do not include confidential company nformation"
good,Long hours at a moderate pay scale. Not much chance for advancement and management does not tend to help you learn or advance your skills - you have to rely on your peers.
good,"The team was not open to older, more seasoned individuals. The assessments were arbitrary. I enjoyed the work, but not the management. Most of the colleagues were great."
good,Global company with lots of exposure to many things. Also knows its abilities and influence. Also aware of its place in the corp landscape. Good starting point.
good,nothing like you would ever imagine.  you don’t want to work here. run by morons. no work life balance.  no ones knows how to make a decision. promotions are given to those who suck up
good,This was my first job out of college. It provided a good base in terms of knowledge and working in a large corporation. One of the things I enjoyed the most was participating on the various sports teams the company sponsored.
good,"So I started on day one and went around to meet my team and shake some hands. The VP over my team who sat literally 4 desks down from me wouldn't shake my hand or even acknowledge that I was alive."
good,"The people I work with are smart and kind, but we al work too much. I was told it would be 50 hours per week, but it's more like 60. We earn overtime at half pay, but that goes away as soon as you reach a certain position, meaning you can get a pay cut from one year to the next, depending on how much overtime you worked the year before."
good,Work from 7:00 am to 5:00 or 7:00 PM almost everyday. The direct management wasn't as good at communication as needed to be which made for in efficient time usage.  Co-workers are either great workers or try to stomp on you or others to get ahead. Hardest part of the job is having any time to balance work with family. Best part is the benefits they offer. The pay isn't the best starting out. If you can stick it out it can be financially worth it.
good,After 9 years at GS I have decided to move on and learn new things.
good,Not a place to work if you're a good person who truly cares about your job or people. It's easily taken advantage of. Competitive environment which leads to poor management and teams.
good,Probably the most political environment I’ve ever experienced. Management is adversarial to Agile concepts and unwilling to accept new ideas. I was brought in to bring new ideas to Agile development practices and product management but the heads of the division were unwillling to try anything new.
good,"A great place to learn a majority of skills, technical and non-technical. The company value adds a lot to your resume. As an individual with minimal financial knowledge, I had immensely benefited from the exposure to financial products. The work culture is great and it's a fun place to work. Initial days are long and depending on the role, you do have to work long hours which is the case with most companies. The best part about working for Goldman is your voice is heard. You get to make recommendations, put your thoughts on the table and heavily involve yourself in project decisions."
good,A good place to start one's career--the name recognition will be useful down the road. Work can be relentless demanding at times with constant pressure to deliver. Competitive working environment resulting in  difficulties to cultivate personal relationships between colleagues.
good,"Goldman Sachs business has been spread over globe. It has various   divisions CSRE, Accounting Services,  Operations, R& D, Funding Ops and so on. The main office is located in United States. There is absolutely no work life balance. The working hours are really high."
good,Goldman Offers the rookie an opportunity of a lifetime. The work hours are so long its ridiculous. Be prepared to have your mind blown open by how much wealth and power is in this company. Good luck!
good,It's a contract position can't expect much. It wants me to write this review longer. I don't what more to say.  Just wanted Goldman on my resume.  five more words.
good,"Not a fun place to be, and learning is very limited to your role. Culture is very hierarchical and super-inflexible. Think more of a dying industry with little future prospects."
good,"tech stack might not be really great"
good,"Although the salary and comp benefits are enticing, there is always a trade off (i.e. work life, sanity, family, fulfillment). As a woman, be vocal about expectations and don't assume your equity is valued."
good,"Not very kind to contractors, consultants or contingents.  They are not equally awarded for the hard work they put in during most the assignments in the work place."
good,"The job was advertised as Java Programming but most of the time, I wound up monitoring the weekly/biweekly production of a report. I wrote a few Java apps while I was there but did no wheres near the coding I wanted to do... so I left."
good,"1. There is no work life balance and are expected to work for 12-13 hrs"
good,"I am not interested in rating or providing comments.  My experience was okay and tough given the remote location.  Management, salary, career advancement was not as expected."
good,My 2 year work experience at Goldman Sachs felt like a 10 year tenure.  I learned a great amount about the position and the role it played in the market.  But it was frowned upon to have a life outside of the bank.
good,Smart people around but very traditional and not very open to new ideas. Pay master in the industry but not great work life balance. Certain teams are regressive and poor management as well.
good,"The culture is very red-tape and cut throat. Not for everyone. The company should allow room for more diversity in their hiring, every person here looks almost identical."
good,"Goldman Sachs is a great place to start your career. It's an aggressive culture and gives lot of learning opportunities. One's career progression is completely dependent on an individual. For someone who is very ambitious and wants to grow in their career, Goldman is an ideal place. Although sometimes it can be very fast paced and might feel little overwhelming. The work life balance is very subjective and varies from team to team really. The culture is great and gives a lot of opportunities to learn."
good,"• A typical day at work included 14 hour days with little to no recognition from first line managers. There is limited to no work-life balance due the pressure of constant dismissals or outsourcing to low-cost locations and the principle of an extremely lean work force. "
good,Culture is very toxic. Pay is subpar at junior levels. Managers don’t know how to communicate. Office politics trump hard work. There is very little transparency.
good,"The culture is a little overwhelming and growth is not possible unless extensive networking is done. Work life balance is hard to come by as you work 60+ hours per week,"
good,"Lots of opportunities to be challenged and stay busy with lots of work. You will have many opportunities to learn and gain more skills."
good,"Work life balance is a problem. Growth is difficult to get. Lot is depended on the management perception about you. I was an intern, most of the office politics was not applicable to me but i could see the culture and environment."
good,It is very difficult to cope with the heavy work load. There is absolutely no work life balance. The management is not very approachable. Not an ideal place to work.
good,"Good company to work for.  Local politics often trumps everything especially when groups merge. Good work and good people are often wasted.  Goldman is an excellent company to understand a broad range of things from banking, Mergers, Equities, Options, Futures, Real Estate and other commodities.  Great company for someone just our of school with lots of energy and drive to make it."
good,So many processes and policies that you couldn't do DevOps which is what you were being measured against. You are spending so much time waiting for tickets to process you cannot be productive on a given day.
good,"Hard place to survive but good for few years experience. Technical learning is almost absent but project management is a plus."
good,"Cost:"
good,Hard work but worth the resume capital. Can often require long hours. Work/life balance depends on teams and managers making it hard to predict before starting.
good,"The job was okay, HR wasn't easy to work with about things. They are not very understanding of personal situations and do not take them into consideration."
good,"Stressful job, not good work life balance, job insecurity, lot og politics on management level, Compensation is alright as per market standard. Bonus are also just ok."
good,"This is purely for the Global Security Office: moral is low, its dog eat dog. There is no growth. The turn over rate is really high."
good,"Long working hours"
good,"I was part of the cash management team in Goldman "
good,Only temped there.  Good experience.  Coworkers were nice and treated well by management
good,"Great Company, good experience and exposure to the market and wallstreet. "
good,This review is from a technology infrastructure perspective. (not business).
good,A typical day at work would be to reconcile all of the previous day discrepancies cash and stock record breaks. I have learned how to upload spead sheets on Excel on internal applications that can be linked to external systems to deliver large amounts of data in a very fast and efficient manner. This process has been proven to save time as well as inputting the data in manually on two systems with more chances to make errors. Management I feel sometimes do not see what the masses see or feel. My co-workers I try to make them feel comfortable and like family. A happy environment produces positive results. The hardest part of the job I like to make easy or stressless by always making the best out of a bad situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing all of the team tasks by their deadlines accurately and efficiently in adherence to all of the bylaws of ouir respected business acumen.
good,"A great place to start a career or get hired laterally as an MD.  There are far too many VPs, so unless you’re really good at brown nosing/playing the corporate game, be prepared to top out somewhere in the middle of the ladder for a long time."
good,"Great company when it comes to innovation and being ahead of the curve (think Google or Apple of capital markets and investment banking). Terrible work/life balance, 50hrs weeks are the min expected from everyone but the reality is your avg. will more likely be 70-85 hrs depending on where you are."
good,"Goldman Sachs is a challenging place to work in terms of work life balance and the culture is tough, but the experience and exposure is parallel to none."
good,If you like seeing your loved ones then I would suggest skipping on operations based positions for Goldman Sachs. You do not bonus as well as revenue side and you get treated to match that.
good,"Can't speak for the other tech groups, but mine was a nightmare. Extreme mircomanagement, stuck in the weeds, decades of technical debt, long hours, no personal life, no gratitude for sacrifices, positive feedback extremely rare. Lots and lots of constraints, rules and penalties; typical of working in a heavily regulated financial institution."
good,"Goldman Sachs is an ok place to work but if you want to advance in your career then you need to be in NYC. Sure they have policies that say you cannot avoid promoting someone just because they are somewhere else, but that cannot be enforced. I have seen this happen many times and have seen people leave the firm for this very reason."
good,Pay limited otherwise substantially. Did have some opportunities to work on completely different work overtime and did have flexibility but ultimately no advancement possible.
good,Your large lids for the Styrofoam tea cups have not fit for the longest time. I know I am not the only person to complain. The lids constantly pop off causing spills every single time. I have ruined clothes and important papers because of this not to mention my car now has tea and soda stains on the seats and carpets.
good,Fairly outdated tech stack; most tech talents left for pure tech firms; slow adoption of new technologies; in house language/platform used throughout the firm. Not the best place to grow your tech career.
good,There is a pool of talented resources working in GS. You will get to learn a lot but simultaneously competition is immense. Work life balance is not that good
good,"This firm's employee culture has changed for the worse. making yourself seem visible and busy allows you to stay off the chopping block. You are no longer evaluated on what you have done in the past year, but only what you did last week. So sorry to see this go bad. Management does not help you groom your career. The mandate is it's not good that you conduct excellent work but what you need to add on to be more visible and gain cheerleaders for your job continuation."
good,I get in at 7 am and often times don't leave until 7 pm or later. I oftentimes don't have time for lunch and have a very stressful workload. the team environment does not feel like a team.
good,"I do not feel comfortable providing a review on the company at this time.  If I secure employment somewhere else, I would be happy to provide a review."
good,"Working at GS isn't the same anymore. Typical day is long. Management expects a certain type of personality that everyone is compared to, you won't last long if you are different."
good,"This is a fast paced environment, in which a person needs to learn quickly. Stay on top of your game and try not to fall behind with your emails......"
good,Great company to work for. The culture is wonderful with a lot of smart and helpful co-workers. Great place to start your career in finance/accounting.
good,Benefits and compensation are the main reason to work at Goldman Sachs. The corporate culture is highly sensitive and also not a pleasant place to work. Management do not spend enough time working with junior level employees.
good,"Say good bye to work life balance. It was a great place to learn from from and I learned a lot while working here."
good,"I worked for GS whilst completing my undergraduate studies.  It was a very positive experience and I had the opportunity to meet many professional, prepared people"
good,Golman Sachs was a Contracting postion with Advantage Human Resources. A typical day at Goldman Sachs was challenging do to the fact that my department was global. The different time zones while working in a fast past environment hendered managment as well as myself with rational decesion. The hardest part of this postion was timing with the various time zones. the most enjoyable part of the job was travel.
good,Didn't like working in N.Y. When I left they mentioned I could come back at any time.
good,"• Worked closely with the trading desk, managing trades as a transaction manager."
good,"You hit the ground running each day and its ever changing. For the most part, the people there are great. Everyone strives to do their best and there's always something new to learn."
good,Goldman Sachs has a culture like no other.  It’s all about teamwork in a fast paced environment.  You just roll up your sleeves and get to it.  A good place to work.
good,"For one thing, be aware that Goldman Sachs is an enormous company with many divisions, so be sure which division and team you're going into.  Make sure that you interview with the people you're going to be working with, since turnover is really high."
good,"At Goldman there is a lack of mentoring, leadership and guidance.  they like to promote work life balance but the amount of hours you work doesn't allow you to take advantage of this."
good,"Very smart people and excellent benefits. You start your job excited (it is Goldman, after all!) and after you are smothered with an impossible work load and long hours, you realize there is no work-life balance. People are fearful of the management chain above them and know their place in the pecking order.  Many old-timers remain who continue to lament the change in the firm since it went public a long, long time ago.  I'ts not easy as a newcomer to break in and be accepted.  People are generally not happy to help a new person because you will take away their time from their own work load.."
good,"There are limited numbers of managerial position in the SLC office as the office houses most of the back office work for GS.  As a result, there is a good chance you might reach a promotion ceiling.  In the operation side of the business, most manager will need to manage people and those positions are few.  I would transfer to the sale side as there are higher chances to reach VP level.  Good luck!"
good,Individuals are generally treated as fungible. GS is an amazing company that gives amazing opportunities but they know that. It is tough to invest in a company that knows that they can replace you and will if they need to. Advancement is based on politics over talent.
good,I worked at Goldman Sachs and it is lot of pressure. You learn a lot but work-life balance is totally outta place. Needs proper management skills to understand the human capacity.
good,"The Goldman culture has changed over the last 10+ years and not for the better.  While GS earns high marks for its employee benefit programs, the firm falls short on making employees feel valued for their efforts, and in the area of inclusion for women in particular.  Simply put, women performing the same jobs as similarly situated men are not offered the same opportunities for advancement and are compensated less. Senior management has too much power to override an individual's performance review and determine compensation as they see fit despite recommendations from managers working closely with that individual."
good,"If you are willing to work 11+ hours a day, then GS is the perfect place for you. Working in GS has its pros and cons, however, by time it will consume you."
good,"Goldman Sachs is known as a competitive and prestigious environment to work in. I would agree with that. However, I turned down an offer for fulltime work after a rather successful and engaging internship for three reasons:"
good,"I learned a lot and raised my standards during my time at GS, however the pace and poor work/life balance was not aligned with my goals as I was about to start a family.  The environment felt more competitive and ""CYA"" than collaborative and supportive."
good,"The company closed this location and moved the work to Salt Lake City, Utah and Dallas, Texas. So this job is no longer available in Cedar Rapids, Iowa."
good,"This is a great place to learn and then move on. In their attempt to seek excellence, they undermine people and think that operating like this brings out the best, but it is a very unhealthy environment."
good,"The firm has its reputation for a reason. They do drive elite busness, and its a fantastic place to learn how to do business well. That being said, long stressful hours do not make it somewhere most people will enjoy long term."
good,"GS has Great culture and highly ethical values. GS supports it employees and provide the best and Challenging work environment."
good,"The pay was less than other banks, but bonuses were higher. Benefits were good in terms of pension contributions, health insurance and employee discounts. Culture could be cut throat as there were too few opportunities for advancement for the number of employees"
good,"The company has great benefits, but lacks leadership.  The work is manageable, but unexplained expectations.  The overall job is great.  I enjoy the flexibility in the schedule of working from home if needed."
good,"Provides a good work culture with a lot of support and guidance from the management."
good,"Company has good corporate culture and but a very competitive space to be in."
good,"Intense non-stop workflow involving contact with bankers and offshore workers through email, phone and IM. "
good,"Great for a entry level job, lots of interaction with senior management early on in your career. Compensation is heavily influenced by firm performance so even if you're outstanding you may get very little"
good,"Work environment is pretty noisy as it is designed for financial brokers."
good,Long hours and challenging place to work.  Always something to learn and people need to continue to learn and develop in order to keep working for the company.
good,over the past few years the moral in IT has decreased dramatically.  In IT there is lack of direction. on the positive side you work with high  energy bright people
good,"Other than that, Its just like any other company that lacks employee support, and no room for career growth."
good,"Relaxing place to work and nice people."
good,Certain Divisions very tough to make move to desirable position without sponsor. Diligent workers often not great people managers.
good,Productive and Great Learning Experience. Very engaging and intellectual co-workers
good,Great exposure. I was a summer intern and was afforded the exposure and opportunity that is not available at other places.
good,"Everyday I learn new things at work which helps me in improving me for a brighter career.The work culture in GS is very different from the other companies.In Goldman Sachs, I have learned not to react to any situations and act in the proper times."
good,"I worked at Goldman Sachs full-time for more than a year"
good,"Majority of employees are from Ivy league institutes, very competitive culture with focus on quality of product. Working hours are crazy and the management is very demanding and ambitious in terms of deadlines. However great learning exposure and if you are willing to go beyond your work duties, the senior manager does acknowledge  hard work and would adequately reward you."
good,Goldman Sachs is a very rewarding company to work for. There are a lot of politics in play for you to get a promotion but if you work hard you will be able to make it.
good,"Great summer internship, but the sort of group I wanted to work for full-time. The group was dissolved within a year, it was integrated to a broader market risk quantification team."
good,"Goldman Sachs is a great company but working within Marcus is horrible. They are highly unorganized and management desperately needs training. There are absolutely no procedures in place to address employee concerns, upward mobility, or even employee relations. I hate that such a prominent company name is even tainted by one division but they seriously need to do something about ""Marcus"" before they have more than just bad reviews on their hands."
good,"Definitely a total grind and can be a bit too microscopic, but opportunities to still learn a ton along with some very well-educated minds to learn from."
good,"You with the right support can learn a lot with regards to finance. However you need the correct support to do this. Work life balance can be difficult, but that's quite obviously in the name."
good,"Goldman is a decent place as long as you don' mind marrying the company. I was brought in under the expectation of working 50 hours a week. within 6 months I was working 65-70 hours a week. You really do work with some great, intelligent people but you never see your family."
good,"Great Place to work,  lots to learn. It is challenging, at the same time very dynamic and competitive environment but if you are good at your job, you will succeed and get rewarded. I loved working there. It is one of the best employers."
good,"It has good interesting problems to solve and potentially vast resources to throw at a solution."
good,"The analyst program is like that of most Wall Street Investment Banks.  Crazy hours.  Get paid a lot for straight out of college.  Ultimately, the hours and lack of work-life balance didn't work out for me a long term career path."
good,You will work extremely hard at Goldman Sachs which positions you well for any job following your time at the firm but it is very difficult to acquire resume skills at GS. After leaving I found it difficult to update my resume with the skills that I had acquired during my time with Goldman Sachs.
good,"Work-life balance is the problem but, salary is good work is challenging. For India location office timings pretty odd but once you get used to it's i can be fun."
good,"While the working environment provides terrific opportunity for professional development and personal growth, I did not feel supported in having a healthy work/life balance. I felt obligated to work 12+ hour days and be available 24/7."
good,"Challenging working environment - great for new joiners to the industry. Great training of BAU tasks and transferable skills. Management lack the ability to motivate staff appropriately when the ask is very high. Fast paced and exciting. Thoroughly enjoyed my time here however hard to grow a long term career that suits both the individual and the firm. Work with extremely intelligent and dedicated people, however the hard working environment can sometimes be demotivating and create a negative atmosphere among peers. Extremely competitive which leads to a lot of work politics. On the whole a great firm with an exemplary reputation in the industry for churning out a high calibre of employees."
good,GS is a good place to work but you feel like another number in a very large fast paced company. You receive good pay and benefits but it can be very stressful. Management is good depending on who it is.
good,"Goldman Sachs is a very flat company where there is no managerial structure to drive change and commit to a single path that all teams should drive towards."
good,"Work with very knowledgeable people. Lot of opportunities to learn a bit of everything. Challenges are limitless and pushes you to learn. Failures are accepted in trying new things,  as long as you have mitigated all the risks in your solutions to the problem."
good,"It's alright - but the coworkers can be difficult and uncooperative. The hours are long and the job itself is rather monotonous. My direct coworkers were nice, most were helpful"
good,"Extremely mercenary management and oversight, especially in Human Capital and Compliance type roles.  They are not there to assist you and you feel it at every moment.  The company will absolutely treat workers as replaceable commodities.  Many of the people there are ambitious, bright, helpful and wonderful.  There is definitely an 'up or out' feeling at all times and there is little margin for error, even if what constitutes an error is ill-defined much of the time."
good,Great if you don't have a family or a life outside of work.  Hence the reason for the wave of interns hired every year.  Good luck getting promoted as a woman if you're not part of the good ol' boys club.
good,"1) A typical day at work:  12 hour days, 5 days a week.  "
good,"GS offers an incredible base for a career, working with best in class professionals who have years' of experience in their function. Great place to start a career"
good,"It is the best place to start your career.Gives you immense exposure and knowledge.I have personally gained a lot of knowledge and confidence being in this place."
good,A global and diverse organization that encourages teamwork as well as self-motivation.  The wide range of product offerings as well as client types allow for significant exposure to all aspects of the industry.
good,"Good long term career growth, lots of feedback, excellent collaboration and team building.  The level of work is challenging but constant. Lots of hours but can work from home if needed."
good,"Great place to work and learn more about how a financial market and banking industry works, good work culture."
good,"The culture is unfortunately full of politics and people willing to throw you under the bus if it help them out. Not a place to get comfortable, but benefits can outweigh that feeling of insecurity."
good,"The company provides good benefits and satisfactory pay.  The day to day responsibilities are usually very manual and process intensive with low personal interaction (except email and phone).  The company provides frequent trainings on compliance, regulations, and updated policies and procedures.  This is a fast paced job and a great company to work for overall."
good,This job has opened the window to learn lots of new technologies and also made me understand Investment Banking sector in detail.
good,"Very stressful work environment, no work-life balance.  Colleagues were wonderful to work with."
good,Loved working there. Although the pay was not satisfactory. You could learn new things everyday. Had a very energetic and competitive team.
good,"Learned alot of team work skills, managing volumes and meeting SLAs every day."
good,jobs were being outsourced to Utah. Elimination  of work-force from Chicago to Utah.
good,Worked there during the financial crisis.  Rather nerve racking.. company laid off alot of people.. but in good economic times the company is not bad.
good,Delivering projects at high pressurized environments and constant change in requirements by users and SEC rules.
good,* Learned some new deployment tools
good,Great place to start your career. Can get solid business experience quickly.
good,EXL is a company where any fresher can groom and develop any skills which are required in any freshers early stages of career.
good,work in call center taking inbound and outbound call from customer about there mortgages.
good,"good place to work, a lot of learning opportunities, good pay"
good,"Goldman Sachs Collaborative was an invite only program meeting on a monthly basis to network with Goldman Sachs professionals, conduct in-depth research on real world case studies, and attend workshops to develop career skills. "
good,"Fast paced work environment, good for a few years but stressful work environment not sustainable for long term. Good brand to be associated with. Company invests a lot for cultural and inclusion activities"
good,"Challenging but fulfilling workplace with unique a unique diversity.  Overall atmosphere was pleasant and involved working with many teams as well as independently.  There work culture, for me, was too demanding.  I wasn't looking to advance in my position but just wanted a secure job that I excelled at (which I did).  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and clients I met along the way."
good,it is easy to get burnt out because of the hours put in. Promotion is based on so many factors besides your actual performance. The compensation is also relatively low in Salt Lake City
good,"The diverse culture of people makes it an interesting place to work. In support roles, try to get hired directly vs. being hired as a contingent worker. You will do the same work for less money"
good,Good to understand the workings of a large company and complex issues in a fast pace environment. Multiple managers and time management is a must. Good place to jump start a career.
good,"good learning experience.  learned a lot but worked very hard.  we were always kept busy, even when we weren't on live deals.  there was an emphasis on putting in face time and creating projects for the sake of having projects.  very smart people, but very bureaucratic."
good,This was my first opportunity to gain exposure to working in the financial services industry. I learned a ton about finance and what working at Goldman Sachs would be like.
good,we used good tech that's in demand and rolled out things pretty quickly. Wish that there was a bit better work-life balance. We also didn't do much socializing after work so can get lame.
good,"GS is a very competitive place with crazy work volumes. Management for the contingent is below average, but can survive. Otherwise it's good. Good exposure"
good,"Decent company to work for:"
good,"I have currently spent very little time @GS to come up with a review."
good,"Good salary, but  a hostile environment and not much room for advancement. I didn't get much out of my time with the company. There are more competitive salaries out there with companies that offer a better work/life balance."
good,Working at Goldman Sachs has been a good experience overall. It is a large company with good benefits. You are paid a base salary with a chance of a bonus each year but the way the bonus is distributed/calculated is a mystery.
good,"Management doesn't promote based on performance, it is very difficult to advance. They focus a lot more on outside hires, and salary is not competitive."
good,"Providing 24-7 legal advise to business teams. Typical work week includes being on the clock and logging in after work hours. Good company benefits, and compensation."
good,"A lot of my time was spent behind my computer and my manager watched me like a hawk. I got caught reading the news one day, that was frowned upon by my manager. I can say other managers were not the same and very likable people, my manager made it somewhat of a poor experience."
good,"I really enjoyed the level of professionalism while working at Goldman Sachs, of course you do run into some outliers that seem to get away with being less than professional but never seem to be held accountable."
good,"Very long hours"
good,"Work can be tedious and repetitive. Interesting opportunities with GS Talks to hear from people of different backgrounds and perspectives. Interesting place to work a couple of years, but not a place I want to spend my career."
good,"Support production jobs, new development and unit testing.Performance tuning for job that run longer; working with QA team for testing of existing tickets"
good,"You can work with smart coworkers. At the same time very competitive place so you need the skill to survive. "
good,"Good working environment, will exceptional talent.  Opportunities to both develop and progress.  Tend to work long hours both week days and weekends, but this is part of the culture."
good,Challenging work under a lot of pressure and competition. Networking is extremely important. The culture is very much about who you know and if you spend enough time chatting with folks about current events and sports.
good,"Fast paced work environment, always something to do, no two days where the same. "
good,"As an architect for an year spent time in understanding business requirements and transforming it to technical design."
good,Goldman Sachs asset management is one of the worlds's biggest asset management firms. Teams and work profiles are decent. Lot of opportunities for global movement.
good,"I spend many years working in GS, and I used to be able to say that ""I work with some of the smartest people in the industry if not world"". This is no longer the case. In the last few years, there has been a brain-drain from GS. "
good,The job requirement is very demanding and very professional work culture. It was great place to work. management is very helpful and salary payout is also good.
good,"its a very fast paced environment. the company teaches not only great work ethics but also a way of life, of spent enough time at Goldman Sachs, one would never fail in life"
good,"Internal politics were sometimes overwhelming."
good,"There is a lot of work pressure as they keep firing people without giving it a thought that other people get affected by it and they have work, even more, harder to complete work. They keep firing people every now and then which sucks."
good,"Paid very well,"
good,"Goldman has great people, a fair and diverse culture driven by meritocracy.  Great place to work for 5 to 7 years, but it will require a lot of work to advance in your career."
good,"Goldman Sachs was a wonderful place to work. I have grown professionally and personally due to the interactions, mentorship and time that I have spent with my co-workers."
good,"Given the current regulatory environment, the work has been interesting and ever-changing. I enjoy this aspect of the role. The nature of the work (negotiating contracts) does not lend itself to a very open/collaborative/creative environment."
good,"Old vs New technology battle going on, you'll get to learn a lot initially until things become stagnant. "
good,"I have great colleagues who are responsible and competent. The hardest part of the job is that the teams are almost always understaffed, and the workflow can get overwhelming."
good,we need best firm follow better security implementation and they give better day by day for better satisfaction all security need to be better working and healthy for best work .
good,a good place to work for an investment bank - difficult interview process and very lengthy from a time perspective. Days are long and work life balance can be difficult
good,"Nice people to work with, good career progression (if you're willing to stay here long enough) "
good,"Energetic, fierce, innovative workplace with great highly qualified colleages."
good,"I have worked with many brilliant people at Goldman Sachs however it is a bank first and foremost, and not a technology company. Expectations should be set accordingly."
good,"Overall good. Up and out culture, no loyalty, but interesting work and smart people. Interesting projects. Nothing else to say."
good,"As a technologist you would struggle through your daily routine as the job quickly gets monotonous, however with smart people around you and with lots of training and learning opportunities made available to you, one can keep their skills up to date."
good,Hard to advance if you get stuck in an area doing a niche job function. Networking is essential around there.  All decisions are made by consensus and can take forever and never get any input from those who actually have to do the work.
good,"Great place to work if you can just come in, put your head down and grind away.  High turnover across company does not create motivation."
good,"Hedge Fund Administrator.  Responsible for processing subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers.  Responsible for money movement, anti-money laundering requirements. Communicate with the client and investors."
good,"The job is good, you get to learn a lot about various workflows and understand all the regulatory aspects of testing since you work closely with Regops and the Project management team."
good,"it's always busy, when we get requests, we work on them right away.  Up to date copy machines and various equipments.  A bad day is when the copy machines breaks down and other requests are piling up."
good,I mainly helped with registration for investors at conferences so my job was to escort the investors to the auditorium. Usually the asked me to monitor one on ones between investors and corporate management.
good,"Working at Goldman Sachs  provided me with a great level of diversity, culture, knowledge and international exposure. I gained sufficient knowledge on trading of listed derivatives, market volatility and client-relationships. My first project at Goldman Sachs, taught me the importance of networking and communication. The job role allowed me to interact with individuals globally and get a better and more clear-cut understanding of how multi-national corporations operate. I had a consistent career growth from Analyst Level 1 to Level 2. However after the second year I made a conscious decision to continue with my higher education and specialize in accounting. My time at Goldman Sachs allowed me to build my character and gave me some real life experience."
good,"Learned how to Tackle people"
good,Too much bureaucracy involved. Dealing with 'old-style spanish directors'
good,Teamwork could be better.  Very political and need to be the squeaky wheel in order to move up and get paid.  definitely not as prestigious as it once was
good,"Senior Administrative Assistant to Five Managing Directors and Senior Management: 2007 to 2011"
good,"This was good organisation, the office environment was friendly and all the staff were skilful and they were helpful for each other in the work place."
good,Goldman Sachs  is a good place to work . Goldman Sachs is one of the best companies in the world and this shows in the performance of the company .
good,"Whatever you thought your to-do list was for the day, went out the window within the first couple of hours.  I learned how to multi-task efficiently and get tasks done on a timely basis.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and had a lot of interaction with them as we sat on a trading desk platform.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my interaction with my clients.  I had many of them for multiple years and got to know them very well."
good,"challenging and high pressure environment."
good,Great firm with lots of different areas to expand your career to.
good,"Good Company"
good,"Organization is an excellent place to work and learn. The business, it is into, is an ocean and unlimited oppurtunities for a person to understand various Investment Banking related businesses. One will be very well compensated if he/she is willing to work for extensive hours on a continuous basis."
good,"High-intensity environment with very smart people.  Hours can be quite long depending on the group."
good,Some very nice people work here.  You have a steady workflow and colleagues are willing to help you. The pay is great too.
good,This firm is a supportive and educational foundation for the rest of my career.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
good,Always intertesting. Had alot of fun dealing with the different various people.
good,"Having come from a mainly Fixed Income backround I learnt the complex structured dividend arbitrage side for International Equities. Although I had traded equities at AIG I had not on the volume or scale as at Goldman Sachs Agency Lending. As well as structured term baskets I would also have to manage the day to day flow of open trades, as well as various projects. The projects consisted of testing the Equilend connectivity to enable International Equity lending and thus subsequently Fixed Income lending. The Fixed Income side of the programme encountered many management delays and thus is still in an embryonic stage."
good,Working at Goldman Sachs has been an enriching experience. The firm has certainly developed me from an analyst to a team manager by providing timely inputs at each level
good,"Determined the duties and responsibilities of individual on the team. Reviewed, analyzed, and approved complex consumer modification request in line with the guidelines of the organization. Counsels mortgagors on alternative programs (when workout plans are not viable options) that can be used to avoid foreclosure, such as deed in lieu of foreclosure, pre-foreclosure sales, loan modifications, etc."
good,This job is based around communication. Learning the tools needed to be able to communicate with mass lists and people all across the globe.
good,"With 8000 employees, this establishment is most definitely a productive workplace. The building is astonishing, immaculate and comfortable to work in."
good,Goldman Sachs is a very large firm which brings several disadvantages. When I was with the firm it was managed with an antiquated management mentality.
good,There's always competition and you have to continually show your visibility. The tech systems are verry outdated and scattered all over. To get a volume data you have to combine numbers from 2-3 different systems.
good,"Too much brainwashing and mendacity in culture. Example: ""We are basically a tech company that just happens to do banking, because most of our staff are technologists. Therefore we should adopt a start-up culture, i.e. long hours, always on, available 24/7."""
good,"Great place to pay your dues. Management depends really on a team by team basis, you could be stuck with the best or mediocre team/ management. "
good,"None.  Not applicable.  Give us your opinion about a typical day at work, what you learned, management, the hardest part of the job, and the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It is a competitive workplace but individuals are usually good team players. To be successful, it is important that you network horizontally and vertically in the organization."
good,"They offer a lot of benefits and are very accommodating, but it is also run like a machine... you are just another number and lack a lot of individual thought and discretion in your daily contributions. They don't really hold much value to you as a person, run like a giant corporate machine as expected."
good,"I mostly enjoyed the day-to-day work, and my co-workers were almost always amazing. But int he end the work life balance proved to much for my wife and 3 young kids and I had to leave."
good,"Great people, great experience, poor work life balance, upper management doesn't provide the support, or correct number of people needed to run businesses and provide an enjoyable work environment."
good,"I enjoy working at GS.  I am never bored and usually am struggling to keep up with the fast pace.  It is not for everybody, but it can be a great career."
good,"There is a lot of politics that happen. Very hard to define what can get you promoted. Working for the right set of people is definitely something you should keep in mind. But its very hard to find that person."
good,"1. Working with smart people but selfish culture."
good,"Hectic, you have to finish your work and ready to help other tema members,leading global team means manage working hours from early morning to late night."
good,"Not all divisions at Goldman have interesting profiles. So please do your research before you apply to Goldman! "
good,"Days start with a team huddle to determine the priorities for the day"
good,"Quite biased place. Even though salary and benefits are really good, if you are someone into your work and not fool around, this place is not for you."
good,Very difficult to maintain Work life balance . No clarity on 360 review structure . you will learn so many things. Only encouragement is year end bonus . No  extra activity
good,"its a place to start but not necessarily place to advance. there are excellent people at Goldman, but there are also mediocre individuals who have managed to settle into management roles they won't be ousted from. "
good,"Typical day at work - Friday excitement! I love working on fridays. Mainly because the weekend is approaching. For employees working 5 days with 10/12 hours spent on an average at office, this is most desirable working day. On a given friday, the first half of the day is spent reviewing/completing critical requests which have come in post log off on thursday. The next half is pent on spending on team activities like knowledge sharing sessions, team lunch/tea break and completing requests with the that day's ETA."
good,"People make Goldman a good place to work.  Some decisions made are sometimes difficult to understand. Sometimes communications are not clear, but overall, good working environment and compensation package is good.  I would recommend pursuing opportunities there."

good,"It’s a difficult work/life balance but challenging you to be better at your job. As many of the others working there are high performers, I️t pushes you to be your best. However, advancement can often be political and not based off performance."
good,A good place for people who are interested in working in a Multinational Company. Had not really learnt anything as it was something related to data management and i was purely interested in finance and the designation given to us was financial analyst.  The work environment is friendly. Being a contingent employee during the job tenure did lower our morale.
good,"-Challenging work and projects"
good,"Fast paced. Culture is very strong. Hardest part is managing building relationships with those who will push your career forward and completing your day to day/ensuring full dedication to providing excellent risk management/client experience. Work ethic developed and expected is very high and you will leave with a stronger degree of work ethic then others when placed in different environments. "
good,"A tighter regulatory environment leading to reduced ways of making innovative profits have lead to a much more inflexible technology environment with increased amounts of bureaucracy."
good,"Day in and out it's reconciliation of company books vs. Clients on cash and stock, inclusive of Tax. Analysis of Delta between books that must be addressed within agreed SLA. Support check payments and Fraud Analysis."
good,"Goldman Sachs is a great organization with ample opportunities to grow into a skilled, confident and skilled financial professional. The organization supports and invests hugely in diversity and culture. It supports work life balance for the employees. The co-workers and colleagues are great to work with, The firm promotes fun at work and motivate everyone to take part in fun activities to keep themselves highly motivated and challenged."

good,"At Goldman Sachs, you will get to experience the life of a typical Investment banking employee with busy hours that comprise of handling multiple client requests, managing day to day work with projects and minimising escalations and issues - all of this while adopting a Risk Manager's role to ensure correct trade booking, settlement and client confidentiality. The hardest part is getting yourself up and running in the process while the most enjoyable is team get-togethers and events organised by the firm as also the community service initiatives. A career at Goldman Sachs is not for the weak!"
good,>Typical Day is very hectic with Timeline driven Deadlines for Sign-off
good,Goldman Sachs is an american security firm that specialises in trading investment securities to or for his clients.
good,A very young set mostly new grads in the prime brokerage area. Most days were busy and fast paced. Expect to eat lunch at your desk but they have a great cafe with an prime view overlooking the Hudson. As I was there consulting there was not a lot of time to learn much and the talent pool of co-workers were mostly new.
good,I love working here. Its nothing like what you expect but at the same time exactly what you expect. There is a lot of politics at play. However i met some of the best people in the world here and love every experience I've had so far.
good,One factor that differentiates Goldman Sachs with other organisations is long working hours. We are well equipped to handle stressful situations with ease.
good,"Learned how to get work/project completed in very short span of time, learn new technologies on the job. Hardest part of the job was to get acquainted to financial world from technology world."
good,"Goldman is a great place to start out, learn and move up rapidly. A great deal is expected of young associates and work life balance goes out the window."
good,"GS attracts and retains many highly gifted people and it is satisfying and challenging to work among them. At the same time the company relentlessly drives employees to the point of burnout. Schedules are long and inflexible, workflow is relentless and increases every year."
good,"Goldman Sachs holds a strong culture and value its people but over the years these values are decreasing due to market conditions and focus on cutting cost. "
good,It is ok.The work is fine but salary is low. The culture is fine.
good,Very good mentorship program and benefits. Environment is very competitive with a rigorous performance review process and challenging promotion opportunities.
good,Fast pace environment learning to adapt in a very competitive and changing workplace keep me on my toes. Management was hands on with one on one coaching.
good,"Very busy but I made some of my best friends here. Great start to a finance career. "
good,"Very professional "
good,"Long hours grinding with an exemplary team of very smart and driven individuals. GS provides ample opportunities to grow and learn, however the corporate structure can stymie autonomy and independent decisions, and creative thinking. Compensation is great, but the environment can be competitive."
good,"A great place to learn a majority of skills, technical and non-technical. The company value adds a lot to your resume. As an individual with minimal financial knowledge, I had immensely benefited from the exposure to financial products. The work culture is great and it's a fun place to work. Initial days are long and depending on the role, you do have to work long hours which is the case with most companies. The best part about working for Goldman is your voice is heard. You get to make recommendations, put your thoughts on the table and heavily involve yourself in project decisions."

good,"Working as an Admin you do not have any growth opportunities and depending which department you work in, the days are very repetitive and boring. The benefit is the name"
good,"Managment style is opaque and non transparent."
good,"Goldman is the best at what it does and until recently, has paid its people well for it. Banking will always be a profit center but the bank is going through huge changes now that it can't prop trade, must hold more risk weighted assets, and can't make markets in FIG like they used to. Serious change coming but not many see it yet. As is, still one of the top three best places on the street to work. Pedigree is fading, however."
good,"Regular attendance and system and mails. "
good,"GS Research provides an avenue to develop a great fundamental skill set, exposure to the equity markets and the opportunity to learn from some of the top minds in the industry.  The seat is not for the faint of heart as long hours are assumed and sleeping can be a luxury. Understand the job and the related sacrifices before signing up and make sure to moderate expectations. "
good,Good place to work and perform. The hardest part is to meet the expectations.

good,"Call center position with calls ranging from 10-80 per day."
good,"Working in Operations, you realize that a lot of the tasks are very specific and cannot be applied outside of Goldman. Although mobility is promoted, it is very difficult to get a role outside of the division."
good,"Repetitive and routine work, management indecisive of change direction, ok to stay for a bit but not for long. Amazing people"
good,"GS India - is a great organisation and there is a lot to learn from all the divisions. However, since most of the management sits in Mumbai lot of partiality is given to the employees in Mumbai."
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,"I balanced company and client accounts.  I interfaced daily with clients and maintained accurate record keeping.  I submitted tender instructions, and converted accounts with new products.

Was team manager, increased accurate department output and achieved positive management recognition.  Reconciled account breaks, and verified positions with counter-parties.

good,"1. Attended meetings to discuss future business projects. Worked with Users to understand needs. Spent time developing financial software. Worked in a fast pace environment"
good,Un-supportive Management that wastes human capital. Two level of management left after merger and team was ignored and was living in fear of being reduced.
good,"Goldman has a great culture promoted through many networks and events.  If you are good at networking and teamwork, this is definitely a great place to work.  The opportunities are there!"
good,Goldman can be a place to learn but it requires long hours and not very flexible when it comes to balancing life and career. You need to make sure you put your hours in order to be recognized.

good,"Difficult place to work due to demanding culture.  Very tight details and demanding management make for a stressful work environment.  Generally, people are very nice and work well as a team."

good,"top notch people."
good,While I learned a lot about finance during my time at Goldman - it was not a happy learning environment.  I'm glad I passed through the Goldman doors but also glad that its behind me.

good,Productive and fun place to work.  Management needs to be more transparent with the team on forecasting and understands each individual strengths and weaknesses.
good,Did an internship in the GIR department Typical working hours 6.45am - 7pm. Very quiet floor to work on and mainly worked independently. A lot of tools to help you learn about investment banking.

good,The most enjoyable part was the people. A typical day at work could range from 8am-6pm or 7am-7pm depending on the time of year. Hardest part of the job was identifying who was genuinely there to help you vs who was there to help themselves.
good,Learned a lot and it helped me advance in my career. But work life balance became unsustainable. I think the team you're on and your direct manager determine your experience.
good,"Competitive and will be challenged to learn new new things every day. Fast-paced and inspiring. Work life balance can be a little difficult to achieve at first, but must learn to prfioritize"
good,"Busy office. Lots of overtime, especially in tax season. Nice surroundings. Good opportunities for new college graduates with growth and learning potential."

good,GS is an excellent organization with top quality professionals. The environment is demanding with a focus on commerciality of actions. Substantial opportunity to learn and advance
good,"While I feel that GS is great company employing great and talented individuals, the work in the back-office is dull. The firm is making an effort to provide interesting opportunities to those in the back-office but often your daily responsibilities consume most of your time. The pay is okay but don't expect large bonuses. Highly recommend the firm for its competitive yet collaborative culture that pushes you to achieve."
good,great organisation with brilliant and talented people at all levels. need to be on your game every single day. no place for coasting. challenging organisation which makes you operate and higher and higher levels continually.
good,Management needs to encourage the team to grow and individuals to develop. Managers also need to trust their employees and overall not hire incompetent people in management position. Managers don’t have your back and will toss you under the bus at any time.

good,"barbell culture- strong discipline and due diligence training at junior levels; neglectful and unappreciated middle management; elitist and pampered but generally hard working and dedicated senior management class"
good,"Very strong teamwork culture, great people who are experts in their fields.  Mobility not as encouraged as ideal, especially for more senior roles.  Have to continually justify your role and existence at the firm to avoid being shown the door."
good,I enjoyed working there. Wish the contract workers could be hired on permanently. The culture diversity is there but at times the job could be demanding.
good,Management ensures new recruits gets a comprehensive understanding of the organisation and helps new employees to integrate into the corporate culture with ease.
good,"There were two 8-5 or 9-6, providing a IT Help Desk Support to over a 1000 end-users on-site, multi-site and overseas. The role entailed learning mainly in-house applications. The demands of the role were intense. The most difficult part at the time had been the cliquey culture where long term staff were very selective in their acceptance  of the new or recently newly recruited staff. The one consolation had been the opportunity to meet new staff during overtime or events during the weekend."
good,"The company itself is very proven, as it is a Goldman Sachs company, however advancement can talk a long time. It is a great company to have on the resume but for their industry there could be other companies that you could work for that would provide better opportunities."
good,I learned more in the 2 1/2 years that I worked at GS than my previous 8 years of work combined. You'll get from GS what you give to it. Goldman. Long work hours.
good,Very competitive and overall a fun place to work. They do expect you to work a lot of hours. overall i would say this is a great place to work and will provide great work excellent experience in the business world.
good,"Just an extremely stressful place to work, but the benefits are great. Good work culture. Not much of a chance for advancement if you do not have a financial background specifically."
good,Need to be sure you are moving up or you will be moving out.  15 % every year is let go and sometimes it does not make sense on who they let go.  Face time is important.
good,GS is one of the good companies to work with and it offers very good benefits as well. My day to day work is between 10-11 hours. The environment at GS is extremely professional.
good,The Goldman office is a delight to work at with people being at the crux if the daily work experience. You work with a talented and driven workforce that aspires to achieve higher for themselves and the firm each day.
good,"Highly motivated and driven individuals. Got a lot to learn. Nice in-house infrastructure. Good tutorials and trainings."
good,Amazing place to scale up the ladder. The amount you learn is remarkable. Everyday is a new day. The professionalism you learn carries on for a lifetime
good,"You should talk to someone that works there. It is demanding and stressful at times, but can be worth the effort in the right role."
good,Great place to work at! Its long and hard hours but very interesting and enjoyable work. There is a big learning curve and very high paced.
good,"GS is a great place to jumpstart your career. The rigorous work environment is perfectly tailored to those that want to hit the ground running. Unfortunately, this leaves little time for interests outside of work. You either don't have the time to pursue other interests or you're so mentally exhausted by the end of the day that you aren't able to do anything else. They pride themselves on work/life balance but this is ill inspired given the standard work week is at least 50 hours. In my experience management is hit or miss. Some teams have great managers that lead instead of manage and others have managers that think leadership is telling people what to do. Overall a great company with great career prospects if you want to dedicate your life to your career."
good,great group of people to work with.  Very understanding management.  encouraging people I learned how to balance work and personal life
good,I was administrative support in the HR division working on project based/annual employee review. The assignment was temporary and unfortunately there was no opportunity to transition to a full time position.
good,"> Regional Market Data Sign-offs"
good,"Fantastic organization for career and skill development."
good,Got more to learn on any technologies here but at the same time there was no limit in Fun @ work
good,The most important thing I learned at GS was the value of teamwork and diversity in the workplace. Teamwork really improved the service we provided our clients.
good,World class financial institution that serves clients globally in all aspects of finance
good,"This place inspires you to give your 100% at work each day. Great colleagues who are helpful. Very fast paced, so little to no time to settle down. On the job training. Immense exposure to operations in banking."
good,The firm in general is great. It's IT is too focused on home-made technology so you might lose marketable skills if you need a move-on.
good,"As advertised, Goldman Sachs is a workplace that is teeming with highly-motivated and intelligent employees. However, there are long hours not always germane to priority of work and very limited flexibility with regards to work/life balance."
good,I enjoyed my time there. The people were always nice. Always willing to lend a helping hand especially since I was an intern. Not a lot of fun activities with the group but i comes with the line of business.
good,"My day/nights were pretty routine, after I became versed in their way of doing their routine. Schedule work was easy to complete without any problems following their guidelines. Management was professional and friendly when it came to solving problems (very few and far between) and understanding as long as the work got completed. The co-workers at the time, were the tops.... I got along with everyone. Snap changes to their Oracle database was difficult but educational and interesting; I enjoyed the challenge. I enjoyed learning how they functioned as a stock conglomerate, their software/hardware venders....one of the few companies of the time that management and employees work as a unit as a company should."
good,"Overall good company to work for. Fast paced and challenging. However, hours are not set and sometimes scheduling leaves little time for personal activities. Incentives can be a plus if you are a hard worker and top agent."
good,"Kind of like going to Harvard, just get Goldman on your resume  --  who cares about your actual experience?  No matter what you do there, it will never hurt.  If you're in the Federation (back office), your hours will suck, the pay is below market, and you will probably find yourself in a highly-silo'd role, but put in your two years and get out.  Internal mobility is a bad joke, unless you want to move to another Federation job.  Don't think you'll move to the business -- you likely won't."
good,"High energy, fast pace atmosphere.  High level and competitive expectation from management.  The most challenging part of the job is adjusting your schedule to fit ever changing workload.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the consistent changes that keep it interesting."
good,"You begin with choosing your desk, Goldman Sachs has an open desk policy, that means you would grab whatever desk you find and you can log on to your system. Goldman doesn't have cubicles, not even for higher management folks. The V.P of your team sits beside you, that shows that GS considers each individual equal. Pretty cool!!!"
good,"The company definitely has a big name on the street, but the hour and the culture are not for everyone. Maybe give it a try and see if you like it or not."
good,"At GS, you need to work hard and stay focused. Would also need to play a little bit of politics to advance in your career. Very important to network with the right people."
good,"Very collaborative culture and heavy emphasis in teamwork.  A lot of brilliant minds at work.  Exciting projects, but requires a great deal of hours so not great on the work life balance."
good,"Be ready to work in an extremely fast paced environment, where there is no room for error. Much of your career advancement will depend on your direct supervisors and your teams performance in general."
good,Always need to think over and above for the client. Flexible work timings to accommodate work life balance. No overtime as the teams are required to only work for 10hours.
good,The place if full of talented people and gives a lot of exposure. It has a lot of opportunities. Only thing is that one must be prepared to work extra extra hard and long to ensure they go long way.
good,Dynamic environment that allows you to develop and stretch beyond what you may have expected and get comfortable with being uncomfortable The most enjoyable part of my job is the team of amazing professionals that I get to work with and learn from everyday.
good,Fast pace environment with high standards and high expectations. Focus a lot on the number of hours worked even if efficiency can reduce the number of hours.
good,I enjoyed my time at Goldman Sachs and learned a lot about the financial banking industry. The people were great and so was management. Great place to start my career.
good,"The 10KSBP Is an exceptional program that provides a wonderful opportunity for companies to grow and develop into their best selves."
good,"Pay is okay . Work life balance is bad.."
good,"Challenging work that was difficult at first, very fast-paced environment with high-volume recruiting. Although challenging it was a great resume booster and taught me about full life-cycle recruitment."
good,"I started working at Goldman Sachs pretty early on in my career, beginning entry level as an analyst and working my way up to the rank of VP."
good,Good place to work. Great learning opportunity. Awesome work culture. Wonderful place for beginners. Management is ready to hear the concerns of employees
good,"Highly competitive but collaborative culture. Relentless in terms of pace, however this is balanced against learning opportunities and exposure to some of the best people in the industry. It is not for the faint-hearted but can be immensely rewarding both personally and professionally."
good,Egos are a huge part of the everyday work cycle. You will be well prepared for challenging roles elsewhere if successful at this employer. Skills acquired are easily transferrable.
good,Freedom of decision on your work and project. No micxromanagement. Flexible working hours. Supportive team leaders. Professional approach towards subordinates
good,"Equipped as a Performance driven EQUITY OPERATIONS ANALYST with experience ineffectively monitoring risk, managing outstanding trades and accurately reporting trade transactions. Outstanding problem solving abilities and maintaining strong and fruitful working relationships with clients to gain their trust and respect. Consistently exceeding challenging organizational expectations."
good,"Results-driven, fast-paced environment.  Teamwork is encouraged though, naturally, there is competition.  Must be very political in order to succeed, especially the most senior levels."
good,enjoyed working here all my co workers were fun to work with we all worked as a team they did have a fountain machine of drinks in every floor so if you got htirsty you helped your self with a drink
good,Very good environment to pick up work experience especially when working with different individuals in different divisions. Projects can be challenging so one needs to be on top of their game.
good,Long hours and lots to learn. Could become monotonous but always room for growth. Managers are about empowering their coworkers. Work is not very flexible in terms of hours but work that is being done can be changed as needed.
good,"Great place to work, but there is an expectation of being available and attainable 24x7.  Your career and your progression is mostly up to you - and hard work and commitment to the firm is rewarded."
good,"Great place to work, but definitely challenging place to work. Good pay and benefits. Culture depends on team and management. Fast pace environment. Can be overwhelming."
good,This is absolutely the one your looking for if your a fresh out tf college. Working with such a big league will be an asset and  a big boost to your career.
good,"It has been a great start to my career. The people hired at Goldman are the top of the top Universities. You end up with folks equally as driven and motivated as you, which makes you step up quicker. Sometimes a bit cut-throat, and not as 'flat' of an organization as it prides itself to be."
good,"Opportunity to work on some of the largest deals, in addition to the most exclusive ones.  Would recommend to those who are willing to work hard while being exposed to the most difficult merger positions."
good,"To keep it short and sweet, the company overall is wonderful and despite its reputation, a wholesome institution. Yet, there are always bad apples in any workplace. A couple of bad apples that i had come across happen to sour the office morale. What was more concerning was the lack of correction from management and/or senior advisors."
good,"If you are young, hard working, and willing to travel - GS is an amazing firm. Good compensation, benefits, and exposure. Work / life balance can be difficult."
good,The environment at Goldman Sachs is fast-paced and challenging. The healthy competition between work colleagues maintains top performing employees and helps employees develop professionally.
good,"its one of the best places if you want to earn good hikes "
good,Competitive working environment.  Good Learning Experience.  Interesting people that are hard working. Diversity is important and the people all seem to get along well.
good,"The trainings and certifications the company provides are fantastic. It is very difficult for advancement and an increase in pay is hard to come by. The work environment is comfortable and friendly, with most colleagues just entering the work force out of college."
good,"Goldman is a fast pace environment full of smart people.  You will always be learning new things, never bored.  However the bar is set very high and people are very stressed.  No work life balance at all."
good,Excellent firm to work for with an outstanding culture. Developed multiple different skills during the day-to-day and through the structured graduate training programme.
good,Worked with a group of proactive and highly talented support people who undertook anything that came their way. Never found a situation where we couldn't assist the process to provide an answer.
good,"Chubb is one of the largest insurers in the United States. Chubb offers commercial, specialty and personal insurance services."

good,"- Handled critical role and responsibilities"
good,"GS is a great company plenty of opportunities. townhalls are awesome to hear from senior parnters at the firm.  "
good,Your co-workers at Goldman are amazing and high performers.  It was refreshing to have such  wonderful support system there and everyone does their best.
good,"Strong culture, strong sense of teamwork, great opportunity to earn a 'real world' MBA.  Work/life balance is nearly impossible, however grind it out, learn a ton from others, and then look up and decide where you want to be in 10 years.  That will dictate whether you stay at the firm, go elsewhere, or decide to fly on your own."
good,"Goldman Sachs is one of the most recognizable name brands in Finance and is great to get on the resume. When you work there, you know what you're getting into - high intensity and high expectations. I enjoyed this type of atmosphere; however, it is not for everyone."
good,"I really enjoyed Goldman Sachs, there was never a point in my career there that I was bored.  The amount of work was vast and the opportunities the firm provided to allow for continuing education was strongly reinforced."
good,"Productive and good management,equal opportunity organization."
good,"Must take care of daily batches to generate reports for clients"
good,"- Day-to-day tasks along with projects centered on efficiency."
good,"Good workplace."
good,Best and brightest people in technology teams. Long hours. Good benefits. Good management.
good,"My day began with the prioritization of my work, as risk investigation was the key. Meeting Deadlines, confirming trades was one of the major roles. As foreign exchange was part of the global team, it gave an opportunity to talk to the clients, traders, brokers across the globe."
good,"A place for smart and hard-working people. Caring Management, good compensation, very professional environment, smart people around and no shortage of challenges"
good,"Goldman Sachs is one of the excellent company to work with..."

good,One of the best financial firms to work with on the wall street. 
good,One can obtain an excellent learning experience.
good,Great place to learn from some of the most knowledgeable and brilliant minds.
good,A typical day at work stresses on completing time critical objective to meet the various market cut offs. This makes team playing skills an imperative aspect of your performance.
good,Competition got too personal. Not a lot of respect among employees
good,I would arrive to work around 8:00 am review emails and check my voice mail. Then we would reach out to the India office to see the progress of the day. Once this has taken place we would begin our work day which would go until 6 or 7 at night. I would do quality control on the the invoices that my co-worker would process and run the express pay cycle if needed. My manager would hold weekly meetings to discuss any issues or questions that may have come up. Since our team in New Jersey was a small one and we all had known each other for years going to work was like being with an extended family.
good,GS is too much politics and very slow due to the culture where even people who don't know much are allowed to stop the process.
good,Pros:
good,"I was brough on to create/build/manage/mentor a nascent Leveraged Credit group. Given an almost impossible timeline of creating a ""top-ranked"" group in 24 months, I proceeded to achieve that ranking in 18months."
good,GS is really good with compensation and bonuses but management isn’t always the best.  They don’t have much work/life balance and don’t approve of working from home
good,"The firm takes care of local communities, especially where we have offices.  Diversity is a strong priority for leadership and there are many opportunities to get involved through networks."
good,Steep learning curve with a lot of exposure to senior management and interesting stretch  opportunities. Had a lot of experience across divisions and was the perfect place to start my career.
good,"Culture , comp, is really good in Goldman however work pressure is too much "
good,"Overall good company to work for, has a lot of driven, smart individuals that genuinely use consensus to move things forward. Below market comp a problem in retaining and attracting the best talent."
good,nice work environment. great culture. great benefits. management is always available and easy to speak to. Mobility is always an option. networking is available.
good,"Goldman Sachs is not an easy place to work, they demand a lot from the employees, but it's a great place to start any career.  It's a place where you are constantly challenged - no day is boring.  The people that work there are the tops in their industry - the smartest group of people I ever worked with.  To summarize, it was the best school I ever attended and the pay wasn't bad either."
good,Goldman Sachs and Company offered a diverse and productive environment that fostered collaboration amongst cross-functional teams. Cafeteria food was great.
good,A typical day at work begins at 8am and ends at 6pm. I learned that there is always room for improvement and it should not only be acknowledged but also be worked upon to make better. There were constant learning opportunities in the team/firm. Management is very open to communication even with junior individuals on other teams. Hardest part about working at Goldman Sachs is maintaining a good work/life balance. Most teams recommend you work about a 50 hour work week.
good,"Typical day is 12 hours of high paced, highly collaborative and stressful work. Great opportunities for high performers to advance their career and continue to be challenged."
good,"They will be just as open as you'd like them to be, I had great experiences w/my managers here. I was able to be somewhat open about my goals and aspirations."
good,"Typical day begins at 6AM from home or gym by reading and responding to emails from colleagues overseas, catching up on global markets, organizing the day ahead and checking for any client issues and needs. In the office by 8AM latest.  Respond to client calls, update CRM, and the race is off.  Internal meetings,  client meetings, presentations, senior management visits etc,  pick your head and it’s 6:30/7:00 PM. Collect notes from the day, follow up internal departments to pull materials together requested throughout the day.  Office is still packed with people.  You are always moving at 1,000mph.  This is where working with bright, focused, overachievers comes in helpful."
good,"The people were focused and intelligent."
good,"Learned skills of team and personal development that have changed my career forever. It was a touch job from a work-life flexibility perspective, but very professionally rewarding and motivating."
good,"Goldman is a great place to work, but comes with a cost of work life balance. the more dedicated you are to work, the better your prospects in growing up the narrow ladder."
good,"For Administrative Assistants, good salaries but limited advancement opportunities...yearly raises are low but do have merit bonus and opportunities to work overtime"
good,Enjoyed my time at Goldman with down to earth smart people in a fast pace environment. You still have to deal with workplace politics and some people are in there to retire.
good,"Operations at Goldman Sachs can be pretty boring at times, but the people you work with make it worth it. I had good co-workers and managers and our team acted more like a small family. The days can be long (expect 50+ hour weeks every week, but no more than 60 hours on a given week - there are a few months that can hit 80 hours/week) but its nice to go outside, get fresh air walk around, then get back at it. I enjoyed my time at GS."
good,"Am extremely organized and professional culture. People are friendly, approachable. It is however disappointing when it comes to career opportunity for Employees. We have to drive our own growth. Everything else is very well and it’s a fun place to work."
good,"Get place to expose and learn to work under pressure."
good,Full of athletes and very fast-paced. A greta learning experience and a lot of room for growth. Training initiatives in place and focus from top management on these.
good,"GS is very competitive, but if you're looking for that, everything is good. Culture is hard to categorize, but it really depends on which department you're in."
good,"Its a good place to work if you want to learn and grow, People are friendly and there are plenty of opportunities to learn, I would recommend this place"
good,Working in the technology division is not as stressful as it is in the other departments of the company and the pay is reasonably good. The tech stack used in most teams in a little outdated which is the only downside.
good,I did enjoy my time with GS. The people are pretty great on a peer level. Kind of hard to move up unless you are in New York though. Since salaries are secret there is no way to know if you are treated fairly.
good,"Learned advanced Java skills like build customized API's from scratch."
good,"Typical day start with planned jobs to be executed for the weekly, monthly activities. Month end, quarter end and year end entries posting as per the schedule defined."
good,"It was great working with goldman sachs good working environment & easily understandable work sheets"
good,"Great place to work for and advance in career, but comes with a sacrifice of personal life. Culture and diversity is great in Goldman, breaks and personal time, not so much!"
good,Many opportunities to develop skills. Many talks you can attend. People are always willing to talk to you about careers and personal development. Online courses.
good,Goldman employees are very hardworking and helpful. Its a good place to learn.The work can be challenging at times with longer working hours and sometimes we might have to work on weekends too.
good,A lot depends on your manager as far as life/work balance.  Once you land a job there you have to work very hard to keep it.  There are plenty of opportunities to learn about the company internally.
good,"I spent twenty five years at Goldman Sachs.  Over the years things constantly changed.  "
good,Its an awesome company to work with. Services are excellent. Though there is a lot of work pressure but its a fun happening environment to work on and grow up in carrier.
good,Summer Analyst interns are chosen from a select few top Indian colleges for positions across various departments. It is a great way to learn and experience the day to day working of an employee in that position.
good,"Great place to learn and grow! Managers are hit or miss but if you get a good one, you will go very far."
good,"The capacity in which I worked there at, limited me in terms of being able to get a full and honest experience there. The work environment was welcoming and you will always have work to do there."
good,"Goldman Sachs is one of the finest brands to be associated with in the banking space. Good learning, good pay but very rigid work hours. No work life balance at all."
good,"- Consultants/Contractors provided level 3,4,5 support for a super NOC which supported the overall Global Network.  Various technologies (Infrastructure, Security, Troubleshooting, DWDM, Network changes, Fiber-channel support, Voice, Network Management, Sniffers, etc...) were supported in this fast moving environment."
good,"I enjoyed my work here, however we had very long working hours and almost zero work-life balance. I used to love my job here, however the crazy deadlines drove me away from the company."
good,"16 hour days with no light at the end of the tunnel"
good,Goldman Sachs is a good company with great benefits but if you are an experience hire you will find you struggle at first to adjust to the pace. Once you get your bearings you struggle to find your fit. The culture is dominated by men and career advancement doesn't always seem possible.
good,highly competitive environment and great scope of growth. there is a lot of diversity in terms of work and people.
good,Great firm to work at. Good compensation. Good culture. Great people to work with. Had great managers who support career growth. Meritocracy based
good,"Generally work around with a very bright, ambitious and collaborative group of individuals. People are eager to provide assistance where needed and not hesitant to work extra hours to help the team achieve their goals.  Everyone has a view they can voice and can participate in various areas of the firm, directly via work functions or via affinity networks."
good,des longues journees variant entre 8.30 et 19.30 avec d'innombrables missions a l'etranger.
good,"Of all the employers I have worked for, Goldman Sachs had by far the deepest, most talented class of employees from the Analyst Level all the way to the Managing Director level."
good,"If you're looking to stick to your job in Goldman Sachs for more than  3 years, be assured of a decent salary by the end of it. Work culture is something anyone can get adjusted to. Only issue is with long working hours, which only increases with every working year. Also your long term goals define whether you will love the job there."
good,Working as a buy side research analyst with Goldman Sachs Asset management covering global Infrastructure and Utilities.My Job involves working with portfolio manager in generating investment ideas through a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis.

good,Overall a good place to work. I was not a full time employee so can't write much. Work life balance is good. Never spent more then 9 hours in office. My manager is very supportive and help me when needed and even commend me in front of senior level management.
good,"Good Career Growth."
good,"As an Executive Assistant, I supported the Investment Banking division Managing Director & supporting team.  Employee caliber & Sr. management was highly intelligent and effective.

good,"Best training and compensation for any investment bank, but you have less job security and long hours."
good,"Great People, solid training program, growth opportunities are sometimes limited."
good,Goldman Sachs is the place where I will recommend for others. Co-workers are very professional and highly talented. Any job in GS is hectic.
good,"I've worked for many banking firms in the security field over the last 12 years, and some things never change. The rule of the game is to keep your head down and do your job. However, the bosses always want the guy who stands out to be prominent until he crosses the boss in some way, shape or form. The job was rather good overall, my bosses were decent to me for the most part. Yet, with little room for growth and no upward mobility in the security division, you are at the mercy of time."
good,Very fast environment ! You have to act and think quickly while paying close attention to detail.
good,"We wear a lot of hats and are usually pulled in multiple directions simultaneously. The most challenging part of the job is managing expectations of multiple groups/stakeholders while balancing very tight deadlines with the utmost adherence to the quality surrounding the details of our work. "
good,Strong culture and very driven workplace.  Goldman Sachs is a very driven workplace with strong work ethic.
good,Start at 9am work on pitchbook from night before. Attend client meetings.  Finish around 10pm.
good,Great place to work that provides opportunity for advancement and personal growth. The people you work with are great and easy to get along with. The only downside is working long hours and dealing with constant stress. There is a lot of red tape to go through before you can do anything.
good,Good culture and compensation. Nice environment and learning opportunity
good,"A typical day at Goldman is never exactly the same but very eventful. Due to the nature of the business you get to learn new things on daily basis. The management of the company encourages everyone to participate in team work as well as self improvements. In order to assist individuals with self improvements the firm has created a forum which provides financial courses, mentors to guide and advise you as well ways to groom individuals to do better."
good,"worked long hours, with many different personalites, but got paid very well."
good,"A rotina no banco Goldman Sanchs é agitada e intensiva, o que é muito bom, pois eu gosto deste ritmo de trabalho."
good,Fast paced with lots of smart people willing to help. Management is supportive unless your get on their bad side. Watch out for everyone as they will be helpful up to the point of promotions.
good,GS is a dynamic work place where people are very competitive and the possibilities for growth are tremendous. Work life balance does not exist. Pay is good..
good,"GS offers a great culture for a workplace and the best part is the trust the company shows even on the analysts/associates to run with projects on their own, to handle responsibilities and learn through tough situations all keeping in mind the client's best interests."
good,"Productive, hard working and fun"
good,"Some of the smartest people in the industry, all working long hours day-in and day-out. Great place to come from, however not a great place to work long-term given the lifestyle implications."

good,Great workplace culture. Great compensation. great environment . I have learnt a lot while working here and was always encouraged to learn and invent more
good,"Goldman Sachs is a great place to work. However like any organisation it has its Pros and Cons."
good,"I was an analyst at GS many years ago so I am sure much has changed. However, the one main comment I would like to make is that the culture was great. I worked with a team of analysts that were always willing to help answer questions, offer training and look to make the team stronger. I have worked in other companies and departments but never came across the teamwork that I found in Goldman."
good,"I liked the people I worked for and enjoyed my time there."

good,"Was a great company to work for after GE sold to them.  Was always treated fairly, company made you feel like you mattered , would still work there if they hadn't closed our center."
good,"While working for Goldman Sachs I was able to meet many success oriented individuals that were always willing to grow by keeping their minds open to new procedures. There is certainly diversity of cultures and backgrounds. This in turn opens the way to innovative ideas and growth inside the company. Goldman Sachs promotes education and continuous improvement by providing constant feedback (through managers) and support to overcome any challenge that workers might be facing, whether this be time management, coping with stress, or team work deficiencies. Workers are undoubtedly compensated for their efforts and the company is willing to invest in those individuals that are willing to invest in the company. That being said, if a person is willing to invest many hours of their work week, they will be taken care of by the company."
good,"Expect 60-80 hours weeks, but the bonus compensates you for the lost time.  Lots of perks, i.e., 401k match, medical benefits, vacation, tuition reimbursement, 16-week maternity leave.  New York office has onsite gym, physical therapist, doctors (orthopedic surgeon, gynecologist, dermatologist), daycare, lactation rooms.  Company stresses their corporate culture.  Lots of career training opportunities available, e.g., presentation skills, negotiation training.

At times there is no clear management and management does not get to finish everything that they are supposed to do since they are spread so thin.
