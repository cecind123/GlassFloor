rating,review
bad,"If you want visibility, you give up on your life. Work life balance is just a term. Company and management do nothing to enrich employee culture other than some employee groups which they probably just have to as a check list/mandate for Human Resources. "
bad,"The shareholders are god.  You are just a little cog in their wheel; and boy do they let you know it. No one is safe, not you, not your co-workers, not your boss. You are replaceable, and that's how they like it."
bad,"Moodys was the worst place i ever worked. Management was terrible with direction changes. 15 hour days were not uncommon, and if you had vacations you were expected to be on call."
bad,"no work life balance, lot of pressure, no team coordination, manager not supportive at all and moreover team doesnot know whom they want to hire. If you are an international please think before getting hired. Dont accept contract to hire roles."
bad,"Moodys is well known for being backwards when it comes to technology.  In an effort to catch up they have hired numerous consultants, but middle management is the same that got them into the mess in the first place.  Consultants are usually never treated as well as an employee in a company, but I've never seen them treated as poorly as at Moodys.  Verbally abused, let go with no notice, forced to work long hours.  If you are at the risk of having your house foreclosed then I would work there, but not for any other reason."
bad,"High Stress environment, poor work/life balance. Management able to bully employees and HR not here to help you, they are for the management. You will only advance if you know someone, otherwise you will feel stuck in your position. Pay varies depending on who you know but certainly low pay overall compared to other companies. Not a place I would recommend anyone to work for."
bad,"The management at Moody's office in Omaha is beyond crazy, and I can't believe corporate has not stepped in yet after the acquisition here.  If you are considering work here... well no one gets paid enough to deal with the kind of stress from the Omaha office.  Unrealistic expectations of the amount of time you should work.  Not at all organized in business process.  Good people leave continually."
bad,"Most employees are average or even if smart are not over achievers."
bad,The corporate culture is a bit awkward and advancement opportunities aren't great.
bad,"Senior management vision are good, however middle management create barriers and heavy politics with little management skills.  "
bad,Overall good experience. I was able to handle interesting tasks with my team and got to know many new things about financial markets and how companies operate.
bad,"No career advancement or guidance from management. They prefer to hire from outside than promote from within. No appreciation for top performers, 100% turnover in less than a year."
bad,"If you enjoy having endless meetings (10-20 per day on your calendar), Micromanagement, available higher positions filled almost exclusively with external candidates, and management teams that operate like the main clique from 'Mean Girls' then Moody's IT might be the right company for you."
bad,A typical work day start at 8-9am and ends after 530pm. I learned how political a workplace could be. I tremendously disliked that often I would feel that work was made up as we went vs. doing projects that were actually relevant.
bad,"not a great organization to work at"
bad,"Credit Analysis."
bad,"There arent many growth opportunities and  you need to look elsewhere to advance.  Mgmt doesn't really care to address this issue, though they are aware it is a problem"
bad,"If you are in IT and want to learn the latest technologies/methodologies, don't look to Moody's. Being such a large company, any kind of tech improvement involves a lot of bureaucracy and buy-in, which slows the pace of technology improvement. It is not a fast-paced, wear-multiple-hats kind of environment.  IT management is very good-ole boys, with white men getting promoted much faster than anyone. While the location (1WTC) has a nice view, the open-floor plan is not conducive to being able to think and focus as you are elbow to elbow with your colleague with no walls separating you. If you want stability and security and a place to work until you retire, this is the place for you."
bad,"Moody's is a well-known and well-established company. The senior management members I'm familiar with are extremely intelligent and successful individuals. It may vary from department to department or probably more specifically team to team, but in my experience it is not the best place to start your career if you have high ambitions (for a variety of reasons)."
bad,"Very old fashion. Technology are way behind compared to its competitors in the financial industry."
bad,"Their pay is on par with the industry averages. Location is very nice. There is security in the building. And you can make good friends."
bad,Good place for a beginner. one can learn a lot during initial phase of learning if put in the right team. there is not a very good work-life balance.
bad,"Co-workers are around the millennial age, but management is not quick to adapt to change. It's a great start for the cubicle life"
bad,"- Toxic environment (in some groups) with everyone looking out for themselves and trying to look good to their superiors in front of others. "
bad,"Technology moves at a snail's pace here, so if you are planning on making it your last job it's a great choice, but for people midstream in their career it will likely hurt you in the long term."
bad,"The company went from having a collegial, affirming work environment to being contentious and back-biting.  As corporate revenue mushroomed, staff reshuffling and managerial indifference seemed to increase as well.  Management would boast of the company's success and the size of the IT budget, and at the same time be very stingy when it came to training, development tools, and workstations.  One thing they did well was to allow for work from home."
bad,"Not a place for young professionals looking to move up the ladder. Middle management has it the worst, turn over for entry level is a good indicator. Not a bank so dependent on team your work/life is great but for the pay it's not worth coming here. Archaic software is used while too many steps to get a simple thing like getting expenses paid for - huge turn off for those joining from companies who are bit up to date. Not looking to update their systems or processes due to their old mindset - another turn off for young professionals."
bad,"Hi, I learned many things in my professional career. "
bad,"Industry Preference: "
bad,"Good collaborative culture, very multicutural with focus on ERG's, good technology."
bad,A 'get it off your desk' mentality rather than a culture that nurtures accountability has sadly tainted my views of this company.
bad,"have not worked here in long time, co changed a lot. Was not great place when I was there. Long hors and demanind managment team."
good,It was a fun job in high school and paid very good for how many hours I worked and it was just a fun job in general but the management was selfish and wouldnâ€™t be there most the time
good,"Great Work Life Balance, Stagnant Corporate Culture.  Faulty leadership and not enough development of internal resources.  Misappropriated resources and promotions not as merit based as you would think."
good,"As a contractor, I had to report to the manager who would not share what exactly are we doing. Just pass out the task and then submit it to her or the repository so it felt like being locked in the room, waiting for the food(work) to arrive. Lots of resources were not available to the contractors and every time we had to go through the helpdesk in order to add an open source application."
good,"I have seen many people (working for Moody's from last 5-10 years) being asked to leave in a month."
good,"Overall its good experiance. Lots of stuff to learn here. New and trendy technologies can be learned here. "
good,"Moody's started out as being a place that felt almost too good to be true. To start with they made me feel like I was a star employee because I took on things that were outside of my purview. However, when it came to things I did know about and volunteered my opinion on, I was made to feel quite low. They have a hard time improving process and making intelligent management decisions. People who deserve promotions don't get them and they decide to hire external candidates instead of trusted internal employees. I'd say it's average. The co-workers are great, generally speaking. I've made some life long friendships here. There was also a fair amount of travel for my position to places like Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, which was pretty great given that you travel in business class. It was later on that they scrutinized the expense report when there was nothing in the policy that you deviated from. Seemed like a lot of nit-picking after awhile."
good,"During eight years at Moody's I had both the best manager I ever had and the worst. The former recruited me into his team and gave me increasing responsibility with a light touch; the latter inherited me, never bothered to understand what I did or where I added value and only met with me when he needed something."
good,"Company has many different kinds of clients, hence everyone needs to work according to the clients needs and that can be anything. So different help end up have different experience and views about the company."
good,"Nice place to work, but career advancement is slow. Everyone does many things, but no opportunity to develop a niche."
good,Work load of three people with impossible expectations.
good,"They will underpay you unless you threaten to leave.  They are very willing to let underpriced, in-house talent resign, then hire backfill for the same position at a much higher salary.  Penny wise, pound foolish.  HR is a total joke."
good,It is a good place to work.  People are young and starting out and thereâ€™s plenty of opportunities for internal growth.  NY Office has over 6K of employees.
good,"Productive, fast-paced and professional work culture. Process-oriented highly regulated climate. Good opportunity to learn process and technologies. Vendor-driven operational environment."
good,"Dificultad de promociÃ³n y desarrollo de carrera, constantes cambios de compaÃ±eros. Sueldo algo por debajo de la media en finanzas. Grandes semanas de trabajo y muchas horas extras."
good,"The business research process is very hectic,and there is not a lot of time for training or self-development. There are daily targets, however it is better than earlier."
good,"Collegiate working environment.  CEO is excellent, strong leader.  Knows the business inside out.  Systems and processes in the processes of being overhauled to improve efficiency."
good,"good company to work for, good networking opportunities. Focus on getting your job done. Work place flexibility ok. It took a while to move into this position and there seems to be. The person left after 5 years since it looked like they were not going to get another promotion on the team to a higher level."
good,Pas d'Ã©volution de carriÃ¨re possible. Trop politiquement correct. ZÃ©ro avantages sociaux.
good,"Good place to start your career but don't stay longer than 3 years. Every situation depends on the group you work in, manager assigned to you and your important to the firm is easy to gauge."
good,"The company and the people I worked with were great and helpful."
good,"Great place to get credit analysis experience. Some analysts are really great with providing direction, others sometimes don't want to take the time. Work live balance is not bad and the culture is usually relaxed. Best to get the experience and move on; if you're looking for a place that will promote or advance, the chances are pretty slim. Moody's definitely hires more outside of the firm than promoting from within."
good,Good work life balance. Compensation on the low-end. Management decisions are made extremely slow.
good,Too much Politics. No promotion for technical people. Best place to work who are great in office politics rather than work. You will find few great talent and more mediocre people.
good,"Company is good in terms of progress. However, it is very difficult to get time for family and almost every weekend you have scheduled releases and have to support. If you are consultant, then there is no chance you to get time for your family and friends. You would get lot of opportunity to learn new technologies and have lot of scope to lead and manage projects."
good,Harvest foods was an alright place to work through high school. Flexible when going back to school. Only place to really work back home. So it was nice to have somewhere to fall back on.
good,"Moody's was my first job after graduating university.   It was long ago.  It was a good place to work, I met some friends.  Not sure of the culture today."
good,"I was with a team that supported me and respected my work. They would always offer help to make sure I understand what I was working on. They also showed interest in my life out side of the office."
good,"I learned that you have to be careful to whom you show how much you know, if you get the right manager they can help you to grow and build your career."
good,Moody's is a great brand with a lot of cachet. Company does a great job in the financial services sector. This is a process oriented and metrics driven organization. Not a lot of room for entrepreneurial types or for people who want to try new things. Sales environment is cutthroat and there is consequently an air of mistrust . Management turnover is an issue
good,"This was an okay place to work. I have worked in better places and worked in worse place. If I went back to work here, I may or may not be happy.  That is all I have to say"
good,"good to work with Moodys as client , Managers are supportive and listen to problem carefully and provides support for activities"
good,"A firm where you get an opportunity to learn and hone your skills. As a fresher I learned the ABC of corporate world and Financial acumen required for the role. I learnt the in & out of creating pitch books for investment bankers, handling client requirements, and delivering on the job. Over my 2 years stint at Copal Amba now turned into Moody's I grew as an individual and as an professional also. Though Moody's has taken over Copal Amba however the culture of global organization never got merged and employees feel too stressed. The amount of input by an employee doesnt resembles the output from company side. However, I still believe that I have learnt a lot and one can start his/her career with Moody's, though a multilayered organization."
good,"I have not worked for Moody's in years and I don't know how it's changed. When I worked there, the atmosphere was collegial and Moody's provided a great learning environment."
good,As an account manager I was responsible for managing over 12 million dollar of accounts.  It was my duty to make sure all clients were properly licensed to obtain our data feeds and to upgrade or downgrade based on their usage after an annual review.
good,"Interesting projects with lots of work. Multiple roles are inherited and juggled simultaneously like developer, tester, client support, client training, and documentation, etc."
good,"The business has a casual and friendly atmosphere. In the production department, you will have the opportunity to work with clients cross many different sectors and geographies."
good,"I wasn't there very long, it's a very corporate process oriented environment great for new employees just starting out.  great flexibility on working from home"
good,"Facilities Management, Real Estate and Project Management, General Administration, Transport Management, "
good,"This is kind of productive and  workaholic place, "
good,"A fast paced working environment with a great team of colleagues."
good,"get information, check it, criticize it and develop an opinion on it. Then discuss it with your team, write about it and publish it."
good,Learned about the Risk Management sector and was able to work with a group of associates and worked to edit models and excel spreadsheets to make their day to day tasks more efficient.
good,Diverse people and culture. Can be scarce on resources. Long working hours.
good,"Well established, stable company with global presence where financial analysts are well compensated but creatives are paid well below market rates."
good,"*Talking directly for analysts regarding debt instrument ratings."
good,"Good work/life balance and a great place to work in the start or end of your career. However, mid-level experience is not rewarded highly and compensation is not competitive with the marketplace."
good,"Great to start, working with lots of smart people. Interesting projects."
good,"Great credit training and exposure to the market. Company is experiencing alot of regulatory changes. Experiance and hours can very widely depending on the group you work in,"
good,Good learning atmosphere within the team but there was too much movement within the department. After some time the work becomes monotonous and the learning just stop. Excellent work life balance though.
good,"Varied job : technical & commercial"
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits and a generous work from home policy. In IT, try to avoid in the Infrastructure groups. They're not highly regarded and are not respected. Try to seek out positions in MA or a Dev organization. You won't regret it."
good,"Its a nice place to start of the career, but work becomes quite repetitive over the long run. Training and development of an individual solely depends on the  team one lands in and the senior members of the team. Each team has a different culture with some being nice and some not. Scope of work and growth is limited."
good,"There is no scope for internal movement and work itself is bad. People aspiring to grow its bad place to start of the career."
good,"This company has a great work life balance, which allows you to relax as well as work under minimal pressure. The culture is also great which is very light and fun, everyone wants to enjoy themselves while they complete their daily tasks. Management is also supportive but needs to be more hands-on when it comes to setting targets and achieving them. Our culture revolves around equality and providing opportunities to all staff members, which is admirable. The hardest part of my job is that it is managing the T&D needs of not only our organization but other Moody's companies as well, which can be very difficult when you are implementing more than 4 training calendars."
good,Good place to learn and gain fundamental experience.  Typically day may be answering emails and reading research.  Analytical work is done a majority of the day but usually done in silo type atmosphere.
good,"Moody's is a good place to learn about credit, although some of it depends on which analyst you are working for. Some analysts are willing to put in time to train but others are not and want you to figure it out on your own. The company needs a better training program. "
good,"There is a good work life balance.  Senior managers are not strong leaders and are generally directionless.  Much of the direction is dictated top down with very little communication going up.  That said, management is very understanding.  Failures happen, and we all try to move forward at a snails pace."
good,"Talk to client, resolve issues."
good,"Great company if you are looking for a place to learn a specific sector or for better work-life balance.  Better company to transition to if you are mid to senior level as it is very difficult to advance if you are junior and/or internal. Also, it's not a good place for someone looking to advance quickly or get paid top dollar for industry/sector."
good,"For the most part, I enjoy working there. My coworkers are great, get along with all of them. Management can tend to be on top of you too much and focus on things that aren't as important (in other words, micromanaging). Hours are usually 9-5, which gives me a good work/life balance."
good,the people are great but the culture is a bit surrounded by popularity which can play into overall success
good,Moodys is a very big corporation with a large reach within the financial industry.  Workplace culture is very professional and numbers driven.  Monthly pipelines dictate a lot of managements interaction.  A lot of very smart people work there and certainly a collaborative environment.
good,Opportunities to work in collaborative environment. A bit competitive working scenes but all in all it is a good firm to stay in and work . Smaller in size so have advantages to grow.
good,"Neutral, it was not a good work environment. Lack of vision at a senior level, lack of growth opportunities.  Skills were not recognized, hence leading to stagnation"
good,"This review is from the perspective of an associate on the operations side of the business. For the first 8 months you learn quite a bit but after that your job knowledge plateaus. This is a place where people go to start their career and then end it. They allow you to work remotely and have a very flexible working hours at least in my department but I hear that this varies from manager to manager. The culture is you show up, do your work for 8 hours and then go home which is nice for people who are not social but if you are looking for a company where you form a very strong bond with your work mates this is not the place. If you are lucky enough you may get into a team that does have a strong bond and spends time with each other outside of working hours but these are few and far between. Compensation is low compared to other areas of finance and there is an unspoken 2 year rule to get promoted to a more senior level. If you're patient the wait will pay off and you'll be making what an average entry level employee would make for any big 4 accounting firm. Benefits are great."
good,"MOody's logo is to promote life - work balance, and in some cases they do.  In the department I work in, FInance team, it's highly demanding, fast-passed and micro-managed.  The staff is great but management is making it extremely difficult to get along.  There is opportunity to learn, however it stops after couple of years, and you need to move on."
good,Moodys analytics is very good pay master. Work life balance i found is very good. Company management at transaction level worst. VP & SVP does not know how to behave properly with employees.
good,"If you are graduating from school and starting your career in Finance, this is a great place to build a foundation. The benefits are decent and management is good."
good,Nice place to get trained in credit. Work life balance is good. Career trajectory is extremely slow and highly political. Compensation is almost always much below all of the exit options.
good,Moody's is great for work-life balance but not so great for career development/salary. Management can be resistant to change given the highly regulated climate
good,"A growing company bringing daily challenges.  Ability to develop yourself and learn from others."
good,"Good work-life balance, many nice people to learn from. I havent been very lucky with my job, I thought it would be very quantitative and instead its really not. Now I am looking forward to leaving."
good,Moody's is an enjoyable place to work. The culture is great and fun. Many activities and events for the employees. No job growth in the HR dept.
good,"Moody's is a good company to work for, however the biggest issue I see is a high turn over ratio. The company does a good job of retaining individuals that are in higher positions, however it's very much the opposite for people that are in middle office to operations or back-office."
good,"compensation is not enough, Good management. "
good,"One of the good things about the company, they do give you freedom to participate in career development groups activities and events. They also offer a pretty good mentoring program."
good,"Scheduled meetings and travel arrangements. Handled all correspondence, expense reports, petty cash, filing, mail, answered heavy phone lines, order office supplies. Created letters and sent out to clients. Handled conference call minutes."
good,"This is what I have accomplished, which self-explains how much hard worker can achieve from this place "
good,"Moody's is somewhat of an ancillary accessory to the financial markets.  It is in a precarious spot where the notion of credit rating agencies are ingrained into the process but many wonder if they need to be.  As such, though it maintains a near monopoly position for its core work, some day folks might wake up and realize that their own risk management is better.  Until then, Moody's is a force."
good,"Very good place to work and learn."
good,"Generate detailed financial and operational projections via Excel (i.e. revenue per region and product, expenses per headcount, expenses per department and project, capital expenditures)"
good,"I feel there is lack of transparency with the working of management. In some teams, there is good work life balance, while in others, it is the worst."
good,"Moodys has a very good brand recognition and its backed up by structured organization and constant innovation"
good,Learned more about finance than coding. Got to know how a team functioned and the importance of effective communication with colleagues. Also learned more about Moody's in the process.
good,Moody's is finance however it is not a bank. It is a good place to work and offers excellent benefits. There are a lot of opportunities for movement across the organization.
good,"Overall on okay experience. They have a very large team so the opportunity for collaboration is there. They have a lot going on, the management team is okay with you being independent."
good,"it is a normal software company. Work is not that hard, pay is in market level based on employee's skills and contributions. Many nice people are working around."
good,"I treasured the Moody's I entered as a collegial and collegiate place. Its attempts to ""run like a business"" ultimately changed that culture and contributing to my leaving for a company that was even more intellectually demanding. People don't leave companies, however; they leave managers."
good,The management at Moody's Pizza's made the job worth the wait to get to work everyday also the learning experience inspired me that a 9 to 5. Ain't as bad as everyone had said over the years this job made want to experience more of the working life style the hardest part of the job was working later then normal. The Co-workers understood that we had to work as a team for the job to run more smoothly also that it would be easy on everyone this way.
good,"I really enjoy working for Moody's Analytics. My colleagues are all a pleasure to work with. We assist all lines of business within the company. We help clients with any other their needs, typically data related questions."
good,Great colleagues and senior management. Easy culture to fit in. Rewarding and challenging work.
good,Very good work-life balance. Co-workers are nice. Progression is slow.
good,Its a good place to learn about structured credit and various esoteric sectors
good,"It was fun working in moodys, i was working as a module lead, and i have learned a lot from here like how to manage the team and other management stuff etc over all it was very nice working with moodys."
good,Good place to learn a lot about credit. Get to work on deals without the strain of the investment banking lifestyly.
good,I have been working there for 13 years. I am ready for a fresh start.
good,Excellent culture in which people from different business backgrounds worked which provided a vast wealth of information in the rating arena.
good,It was a good small family owned company ...............................................
good,"This is a well established, reputable company that offers scope for interesting work, learning opportunities, and for meeting market needs with great products. It has good corporate culture, offers great benefits, and market rate salaries. Overall, had a positive experience working at this company."
good,"Challenging and engaging workplace. Company has industry recognized brand and products which make customer engagement easy.  Workplace culture is open and highly focused on D&I.  Management is great, but top leadership has been in place for 15 years.  Company is becoming a bit more bureaucratic as time advances which is challenging.  Most enjoyable part of the job are the people. Organization is full of talent."
good,"I enjoy Business Analysis. I love working with various stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements. I worked on an average  60-80 hours a week all the years at Moody's. I never felt over worked since I enjoyed what i did. I learned about Credit Ratings Domain in depth. I learned to work to fulfill Audit and Regulatory and manage SOX control needs. I worked with offshore QA team to help them automate functional and regression testing. Most challenging and fun filled part of the job was to manage expectations of the Business, Compliance and Legal teams since the impact of the application systems was real time on the marketplace."
good,"Everything has always been done a certain way, it continues to be done that way. Rhythmic, cyclical monthly process on point. Doesn't seem to be much room for upward mobility."
good,"At Moody's, people work reasonably hard, and they work reasonably well together. "
good,"Moody's makes you really good at what you do. Increased rigor and documentation requirements shape you into a true professional. Once you work here, you can work anywhere."
good,"Great work life balance. Not too stressful. Complacent culture. Not a place for millennials. Everyone is very helpful, but there is a lack of mentorship."
good,"Worked in Moody's IT department for couple of years. The company is great. I can't say enough about the company. It felt like a family over there. Their compensation was competitive with great benefits: PTOs, 401(k), Profit Sharing, bonus, volunteer activities, excellent training options. Just the mid-level management of their IT department is not that good. At times they look confused with directions they should be taking. Work load and demand for the new projects is so high that you'll spending most of the time (more than 8 hours) to get the work done. Even though the management supports the training and career development, there is no time left after meeting the project deadlines to advance skills or learn something new and use that at workplace. "
good,"Moody's is a good place for full time employees, not so much for contractors. Just two weeks after extending the contract, they cancelled it with no indication of why."
good,Experienced professional seeking to utilize analytical and technical skills sets to become a valuable member of your team/company.
good,We learned lot over here but the only thing it's more or less a admin kind of job. It's not creative but timing and punctuality is more necessary. We have an opportunity to use very advance tools and quick turn around. We have an opportunity to work with people from all regions.
good,intuitive workplace and great staff.  It is enjoyable to work alongside current and all staff members.  Work is demanding but is also sense of accomplishment when completed.
good,Business culture is very button down since it is an accounting firm.  A lot of old school why of looking at the business.  Very solid after going through some changes 5 yeas ago with the economy.  Not open to new changes in the way processes are done.
good,"I learned what it was like to work in an office type setting with various different tasks ranging from administrative work, client services, and assisting the data/research team in any tasks that needed to be done. The management was very laid back and relaxed, however was efficient in getting what needed to be done, done. My co-workers were very nice and we shared good stories about our lives and it felt very relaxing and stress free environment. The hardest part of the job was the calling of sources, we had in the data base, not having updated information that we could use. The most enjoyable part was the relaxed dress code and the activities within the community we did to help the youth at the community center, creating a carnival like atmosphere for the day."
good,It was a great experience to work for such a large organization. It was very quiet and everyone stayed to themselves and worked hard.
good,"Pros"
good,"Worked with a group of incredible professionals"
good,There is always a meeting in Moody's and many of them do not go anywhere.  There is good work to be done but you always have to stay within the limits of what is available.  Doing things differently although better will not get you promoted.  You have to fit the mold management wants in order to get promoted.
good,"Things move slowly with several layers of bureaucracy. Agile process not adhered to. Technology is behind the times, specially when it comes to rolling out new products. People are friendly. Great work life balance."
good,"Good Company to Work, Nice Work Environment, Should Focus More on Infrastructure and other benefits"
good,"Work/life balance is excellent, easy to work from home, great parental leave, 401k, health insurance. Pay not amazing, but great benefits."
good,"Great place to start of the career, and good guidance from seniors of the company.. Good training at work place on technical and personality development. Overall best palce to gain experience"
good,Moody's Analytics is a great company to work for and expanding and growing quickly.   There are many opportunities available and an overall good working environment.
good,"good work/life balance"
good,Great people to work with in a professional yet welcoming environment allowing a nice work-life balance for all employees.
good,"Decent - Great Hours and Job Security, poor management not much room for advancement"
good,"A right place to work, grow at a considerable growth."
good,Moody's is a great place to start your career and grow internally. They have a flexible WFH policy and also a pretty good work/life balance. Their compensation is under market.
good,Almost everyone is willing to engage with others and help out. Employees at all levels are encouraged to voice their opinions. Management is committed to support volunteer work and has a strong diversity program.
good,Moody's has a great culture! There are many opportunities for advancement and growth. People are there to help you suceed in your career. I highly recommed Moody's as a place to work!
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Moody's. I got to learn a lot from my first manger who was very hands on and held lots of meetings. My next manager didn't have all the general skills and wasn't as good a teacher.
good,"Great culture, smart people, comfortable, Work-life balance is good, paternity and maternity policy is good as well as other benefits."
good,Moody's has a great culture promoting work/life balance. Career advancement is slow with many different levels within the corporate hierarchy. External hires tend to move up faster.
good,"If you are a self-motivated and have good problem solving skills than you will do well in the Waltham office.  I was able to work in many different roles, which gave me a good back ground in operations management.  The culture is pro work place balance with family and work and it is a fast paced environment.  It is a small office setting and it is a good group of people to work with."
