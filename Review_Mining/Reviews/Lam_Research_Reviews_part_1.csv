good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
bad,"Management is a bunch of clowns and back stabbers. If you're not their ""friend "", youll never get anywhere in the company. "
bad,"Bad mgt, bad pay, not on par with market, no collab b/w groups."
bad,"Grade f racial racism "
bad,IT Operations Completely Dysfunctional. Some real b&st&rds working here.  Subject matter experts ignored.   InfoSys has a stranglehold on IT.  Tons of meetings.
bad,"They will have you train your replacement before laying you off. There are people there who have been on temporary employment with lam for over 8 years. You will spend your nights assembling hyper expensive machinery to allow this company to make billions in profit, and they will not even give you full time employment status in return. The work enviroment is extremely unprofessional, coworkers and managers were often hostile. I regret quitting my other job to work for LAM."
bad,"Worst place to work for, they don't have stable work orders, so when you complete of what they need, they let you go,  many people did very good job, but they have to let them go because they running out of work, they don' t need you anymore."
bad,"The only way guaranteed to become full time employee for this company is if you have a relative already working there or is a friend of someone that already works there for years. Most employers in this company are all relatives. And most of the full time employers there that been working there don’t know how to train anyone, don’t speak very good English so it can be hard to comprehend nor do they know how to use a computer (don’t know how to send a simple email). This company wold take 1-2 years to decide if they want to convert you full time or let you go. This company unprofessional fire you through phone call on your days off rather than do it in person. Most importantly if you’re temporary, you get NO (ZERO) benefits...so you can go to 1-2 years with NO benefits. Oh and if you have to call in or have an family emergency, there is no number to call, you have to email; your employer, your boss, your manager of the shift and your lead. Overall this company is very unprofessional and unjustified."
bad,I enjoyed troubleshooting  and gained experience reading and tracing schematics. Tough crowd to work with. Incosistent expectations. Poor leads evaluation/selection. Poor code of conduct among employees. Great Supervisor with poor support from upper managment. Team work non-existence.
bad,Lam had a toxic culture of hypocrisy when it came to it's internal rules and guidelines. They regularly lied to and mislead their customer to mask the real issues.
bad,"What used to be a nice place to work has turned into a ""dog-eat-dog"" culture.  Work/life balance completely out of balance.  Not recommended as a place to work."
bad,"If you are one who assembles the tools you are looked down upon by management and under paid. Management is a major problem here. They preach a specific set a ""Core values,"" but it is just lip service. Management directs the assemblers how to their job but do not know how to do the job themselves. They preach ""open communication,"" but when you try to be open and honest, it is viewed as complaining. Unless you want to be a ""butt kiss,"" there is little advancement opportunity. If you are mechanically inclined but do not have at least an Associates degree then advancement is none. People with a degree and no experience, who ""couldn't change a light bulb,"" get brought in to test the function of the tools over advancing someone up from an assembler, who has been there for years and could build the tool with their eyes closed, just because of the degree. Then when a problem arises with a tool at a customers site, the assembly department gets the blame from management. All they truly care about, despite what they say in all their meetings, is the shareholders and the value of their stock. Temporary employees with no experience, at times start out making more than hired on employees who have been there for years. I have even trained ""temps,"" who were making more than me. "
bad,The Tualatin factory was merged with Lam a little over 3 years ago. The management at the factory is still left over from the Novellus team.
bad,"Poor Field Service Management in Place - No Leadership - Only looking for technical people that can be used and abused, and then disposed of afterwards while management takes all the credit for the work you end up doing."
bad,"Find a different company to work for."
bad,"Pay and benefits were decent."
bad,"At first Lam was ok. I went around telling people about it and what a great company it was. As time went by, I saw a lot of favoritism, and hopes of getting anywhere if they don’t like you are very slim."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
bad,"Unless your best friends with your lead and and other supervisors, you can expect a droning experience at LAM research. you need to Master every single Op in your line before being considered to become a ""Blue badge"" which is still not a guarantee. some ppl have spent 3 years of there lives working temps w/o benefits here even coming back after their contract has expired. goodluck if you have the patience and stamina to pursue this as a career"
bad,"They waist alot of time and many unopened prototypes, that are just dump every quarter, all new employee need to be trained for 3 wks before you allowed access to your user programs, doors, and others access, there is a buddy assigned to you, hopefully he can help when asked, I could not understand what he saying, also a old slow Corvette driver who likes to frame people."
bad,"Assembly:"
bad,"The company provides good training for new graduates, so really good to learn new skills. But also pushes new hires badly, and managers usually drive employee crazily, for example, frequently after-hour work til mid night, without any compensation."
bad,"The Manager that hired me left and the group moved to Fremont."
bad,This company was one of the worst places I have worked at.  Avoid at all costs.  Management is only concerned with numbers and treats employees like they are disposable.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Lam until managements true colors began to shine and NOT in a positive manner.  They favor men over women, military over non military and support poor hostile behavior from management 100%"
bad,"Livermore plant is not a good place to work. Bad hours, managed by a liar. After two years of working from 6:00 pm to 6:00 there is nothing good about this company that I can point out."
bad,Great stepping stone to hone your skills in the microelectronic technical field. Would not recommend to an experienced individual in the microelectronic field due to LAM's delay in customer satisfaction and technology.
bad,"My group had terrible direction and guidance under iffy management. Pay was higher than national average, but didn't keep up with workload and living costs-- made more money as a temp than a real employee."
bad,This is the old Novellus facility now owned by Lam Research...The incompetent management that led to Novellus being acquired by Lam is still running the place.  Until they purge management this will continue to be a toxic enviroment
bad,"I worked there for over 7 years."
bad,it is a large company that is a factor in the chipmaking industry as they make the machines.it is a good company if you are a full time employee and it offers a lot of internal tools.
bad,"The management seems to switch priorities at a moments notices. There is poor communication amongst groups. And to make matters worse, there are often unclear expectations and undefined processes."
bad,This company is terrible to work for. Management promises the world and then never does what is promised. There is favoritism that causes more qualified persons to lose out on advancement.
bad,"some of the best people to work with good perks and bonuses. the traffic in the Fremont is some of the worst I have seen. The "
bad,"Very clique management, especially in shipping department. Receiving has no structure and poor training. Leads throughout the warehouse don’t seem to recognize hard workers or listen to ideas to improve productivity and instead promote people they have personal relations with or employees who have no mind of their own. The supervisor of the warehouse is never actually there, pressures department leads to discipline temp workers for breathing wrong, and doesn’t care ( if not encourages) the discrepancy of treatment of temp employees vs lam employees. "
bad,"The management at Lam, in my group, don't stick around for long, "
bad,Management was horrible and unorganized. People that worked there for a while were lazy. they hire anybody so a lot of people there are super weird. Unless your buddy buddy with your lead this is not the job for you
bad,"Lam’s innovative products provide a vital link between the visionary designs for the latest electronic devices and the semiconductor and electronics companies that produce them. In fact, nearly every leading-edge integrated circuit made today has been processed with Lam Research equipment."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
bad,"The company as a whole seems to have their things in order and treat employees well. Their Tualatin manufacturing facility is the exact opposite of that. They provide very little and wildly inconsistent training, direction, support and leadership. Many of the supervisors and managers are petty, cliquish, and divisive. There is almost no opportunity to advance ones self within the organization (without brown-nosing) and they prevent productive employees from transferring within the company. This is such a shame since I find the work itself to be challenging and rewarding. "
bad,"This company has morphed into a large corporation with layered bureaucracy with many internal procedural barriers preventing fast and innovative product development.  The tag line of innovative product solutions no longer applies, instead the process and procedure takes precedence over everything else.  In order to be fast and responsive to customer needs you need to work outside the normal process.  Just don't get caught or you will be eliminated."
bad,"Working here, I've realized quite a bit about the culture and how to advance in this job. Nepotism; if you have a family member or are married to someone in the industry, your chances of being hired on from temp position (as an assembler) are a lot higher than those whose attendance are great and show mastery of the tool. "
bad,"The benefits are decent for the job, but I desire more advancement. This is something that rarely happens in this organization. If you need a job and they are hiring they will pay you reasonably, but do not expect to move beyond the entry level position. I was given an ""opportunity"" to help the supply chain for six months with the possibility to move into that department. At the end of my term the company had downsized that department and I was sent back to assembly. In that time they also terminated hundreds of temp workers. It's sad that the company throws it's workers under the bus when times get tough. Management is almost completely removed from the actual happenings on the assembly floor, and when notified about issues very little is done to rectify those issues unless they directly effect the product. They have a list of core values that they seem to disregard on a daily basis, and that level of hypocrisy is infuriating."
bad,"We were always rushed to do 3x the amount of work, after they fired half the crew. They push their temps to the edge and squeeze as much out of them as they can. They don't hire temps on very often or at all."
bad,They bring their own cronies and sometimes they are unqualified people then they regularly lay-off people whom they do not like.
bad,"Fancy application site, even suggests using a laptop or non-smart device to complete application process, but they seem to lack the common courtesy of giving ANY sort of response or updates on the process."
bad,"Extremely, hostile attitudes towards women. In group meetings or training sessions, most of the women sit silently; and do not make any contributions the entire day. The are conditioned by males - who attack anything a woman says. Any woman who speaks up is challenged by idiot men and spends the rest of the training being hounded by men who are clearly retaliating. Even young men in entry level positions, hold the belief that no woman has any possible insight of value; or is capable of making a contribution. "
bad,"I worked here for about 1 year, and it was great until they put all their contracted employees on furlow. They messed up with Samsung, who was a big contract for them, leading to the loss of that contract. Therefore, business was slow and they needed to cut All their contracted employees. Very disappointing."
bad,"Work is not much interesting."
bad,As an Assembler you're treated as the lowest employee. You never hear about any company/policy/procedural changes until the last minute and there is little to no chance for getting hired on or advancing in the company. Felt like i wasted 2 years of my life.
bad,"Tribal knowledge is king."
bad,A typical day at work was a typical day.  I learned a bit about this and a little about that.  The workplace was a place I went to work at every weekday.
bad,"Field Service Engineers beware. If you like to be put in a box, troubleshoot with a script, and be treated like a janitor then this place is for you. If you enjoy using your brain to solve complex problems, run, don't walk."
good,"Not a nice department to work in. Definitely do not recommend it. They use FrameMaker like it's a typewriter; know they should use Word but top execs refuse to change. It makes no sense. Senior management in this department is poor regarding their own people skills. It's a negative atmosphere with senior employees being abusive to contractors. Even when you report issues, they won't address them other than to side with employees being essential.  Nonsense! Management chooses to do nothing to solve issues or harrassment problem. Other departments are fine to work in. Just not for Training Development in Building K. It's toxic and hostile! Spare yourself the ugliness."
good,"This company uses its contract employees selfishly, and does not think of the repercussions it has on them. There is little management to employee communication and it shows in the work environment. full time employees are lazy while contract employees get work done as fast and best they can to get no recognition."
good,"The company itself is doing great but if you want to have a secure job like the supervisors then creat issues without people knowing and then fix them and gloat about it so people think you are amazing. Seriously, that how’s my supervisor has come so far he even steals from the company and gets away with it. Just kiss (Donkey) and when you do something right point it out or else you will not be noticed."
good,"If you are not liked by the manager, good luck being hired on. There's alot of favoritism. Some leads are lazy. Supervisors can't take care of their jobs. Managers are biased and dont really care about you."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,Steady pay but little to no opportunity to advance. Management never delivers on promises. Raises are once a year and the amount is up to your supervisors discretion. You'll be told there's lots of opportunity to grow and advance your career but it's rare for anyone to actually get a chance at a new position.
good,"Too much expansion to the point of peoples jobs being at risk due to lack of work. When there is work its stressful,fast paced,which makes everyone's attitude reflect it."
good,They should manage there forecasting better in order to headhunting employees and laying them off shortly after. Employees are the last thing on there core values for sure.
good,management is poor they always have issues with everything you do long hours on call and weekends they call you in for holiday shut downs i wouldnt recommend
good,Process engineering at LAM is a tough place to be due to poor work life balance. The culture is bad with lots of impromptu requests for weekend work apart from the long weekdays.
good,"Long hours, dreadful days, lack of tools & test instruments, Poor job security and promotions, No support, Snipes, backstabbing, good food, good benefits,"
good,"Lam was a great place to work when I started. They were in a hiring frenzy and had a ton of benefits and reasons to want to come to work. This all changed once the new labor workers helped them hit record factory numbers. The factory in Tualatin change management and with this came a hammer. The mood changed on the production floor and sweeping layoffs happened. Management was ALWAYS cryptic about workforce shifts even when every worker knew they were coming down and happening."
good,"Starting at lam working night shift was a great experience and enjoyable to work each shift. Switching to day shift in the same department made my experience flip entirely, work moral was extremely low, management was not as robust, and work was no longer enjoyable."
good,"Typical day."
good,"Overall, a decent place to work but work life balance is difficult to attain.   Fast growth, fast pace, not overly friendly.  Salary and benefits are good although 401k match is below industry standards."
good,Having Intel as a customer is terrible as they are spoiled kids. Hardest part of job was keeping spoiled progressive and liberal Intel employees happy.
good,"Unrealistic expectations, top-heavy, great deal of territory protection and nepotism, excessive use of outsourced and overseas materials with long-lead items; i.e an off-the-shelf circuit breaker outsourced to South Africa?!?!, poor supplier relationship management, many antiquated ways of managing materials data."
good,Great technicians!  Poor management. I had high expectations for this company but am sadly disappointed.  The thought is work more hours and not think of a better way to do the job.
good,"The Director who brought me in was a great leader for the entire team and supported professional growth, etc.  A new Director was brought in, who seems like a nice person, but is definitely not a leader; probably a questionable manager based on comments from the team previously managed.  Creates a lot of chaos or turbulence within the group, poor communicator with no apparent strategy or direction that was shared, and has stated that s/he will block a team member's request to move to another group.  "
good,Tribal knowledge all the way through half thought plans does  not listen. To employees on floor who are the directly affected. No concise timelines or promotions.  Was expected to teach higher paid new hires while recicieving no compensation after 4 years.
good,"Advancement is only offered to the management's favorite employees. "
good,"It was a good job when we were busier and people actually got hired on but the minute the business slowed down nobody was hired on and over half the temps were let go. As a temp I don't know a single person who uses the benefits provided because they are so bad and over priced. As a temp there are only 6 paid holidays and no PTO.  As a full time there are around 12, lots of PTO, profit share, and great benefits but that's if they ever hire you on."
good,"Working at LAM Research, was fun and had a lot of new experiences and challenging, but there was only one thing that, I am don't like is the management. They didn't see who's hard worker and keep making new rules that doesn't no help the company and worker."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,"management needs work, lunch is short, cafe needs improvement, Veteran friendly work environment, night shift is mellow while day shift has many ""big wigs"" and other higher ups walking around."
good,"Not the greatest places worked (formerly the site was called Novellus). Everyone seems to be at each other's throats. Each team (software, hardware, electrical, mechanical, process) are dependent on each other. A true management and scheduling nightmare at times "
good,Lots of hard work rework and fixing mistakes. Job security is non existent unless directly hired through LAM. Otherwise you'll be employed by a Temp agency and become a contracted worker.
good,1. Good stock options
good,So many workers lack motivation that it drags on the production floor.  This is largely due to massive changes in management style that seems to have removed all of the morale boosting incentives and has increased micromanagement to a very high degree.
good,"-Good company"
good,"nice place to work, and start a carreer!"
good,"You build all the whole time you are there. Even though the shifts are long they go by fast. Not everyone is at the same skill level, so it can be frustrating at times when the lower skilled employees are not expected to do much."
good,"Working as a temp provides little opportunity to provide a true review of working at Lam."
good,"follow the OMS on all jobs. management was strict, co-workers was ok. the hardest part of the job is to do reworks, the most enjoyable is when systems shipped"
good,"No game room. No team building or any type of group activity. Not worried about the quality of tools any more, and just how fast we could get them done and lost total respect and consideration for the employee and focused on telling us how much money we made them while offering us, who made the money for them, nothing in return. They would even complain about meetings saying it's taking up time off the floor."
good,"Old boys club, if you know someone in higher positions you are untouchable and even promoted. "
good,"Its ok. You get to test PECVD tools without exposing yourself to any chemicals. They only use inert gas in the fab. There is poor morale and poor management in the manufacturing fab. The floor will run into problems over and over and over for years without engineering fixing it. They band-aid everything and just deal with it as it goes. Management seems to be getting better, but only time will tell. They like to say things will happen or change, but no one does anything about it."
good,"As an engineering company striving constantly improve lean manufacturing practices, teams directly tied to manufacturing tend to have the least life balance. Pay is decent and getting better for most organizations. Benefits are excellent."
good,There is little to no internal promotion and no career path for entry level positions. Lam Research is a great company work for but there is no movement available for techs who want to further their careers in the company/industry.
good,"I have to admit that I did not have their house style manual so, I may have been off on a few suggestions. I found that I definitely enjoyed the process of combing through this book looking for errors and I have been encouraged by friends to approach science and technical education publishers for proofreading opportunities."
good,A lot of hard working employees who always looked out for one another. There were a number of tight nit groups that have worked at the company for 15+ years to 1 year.
good,"LAM research has been an excellent company to work with, it can look a little intimidating if you have never worked in a factory or even for a tech company but the employees and upper management are there for you at every step of the way. unfortunately with the semiconductor industry slowing down business is slow and you often find yourself doing nothing for 12 an a half hours."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,The company is solid in that you will learn a lot however it's difficult to get hired on by the company. They use a lot of temp agents and it's difficult to actually get a job there.
good,Lam Research was a great opportunity to work. I was contracting for about 6 months then laid off due to cutbacks. During the time I was there had a great experience and was able to gain new skills. They always something new to learn. They always had opportunities take classes and learn new skills.
good,"Decent company to work for, learning oppurtunities, growth, good benefits management, cross-training. Nice working with the coworkers playing in table tennis tournaments, their cafeteria foods, etc."
good,"Management is not up front and is extremely last minute on decisions. Benefits are great if you can put up with management's schemes and lies. Job security, in this industry your job is not safe."
good,"The Cultural is not balanced and it's not a friendly work environment if your use to speaking to people daily.  "
good,Lam research is a great place to work at. Fun ways to learn new things about how new technology chips are made and what tools contribute in making them.
good,"Overall, It is average company to work for. It is production work building tools for semiconductor industries. Management, workplace culture are OK. I have learned a lot of new experience at Lam."
good,there was not much available work during my tenure.most days wer spent looking for things to do or being sent to unfamiliar areas. the communication between different levels of managment and the floor staff was dismal.
good,"Typhical day worked 8hrs, good place to worked co-workers very nice and my boss. Hardest part of the Job if the parts not available for the custmers. Most enjoyable part of the job co-workers are very helpful and shares time and effort to resolved problems."
good,I would work there again it was fun but they did not pay enough. The hours were great and the job itself was easy. No future for advancement it felt like a dead end job
good,Great place to work.  Very smart management and high level of talent workforce.  Very collaborative and team oriented workforce.  Would recommend working hear to my friends.
good,"Good variety of toolsets to really learn about. Training is minimal before you are on your own, which is great for some, not for others. Hours are long, lunches are short, it is a clean room environment."
good,"At Lam Research, we create equipment that allows chipmakers to build device features more than 1,000 times smaller than a grain of sand. This tiny scale has a huge impact. Virtually every leading-edge chip inside the electronic products you use every day (TVs, smartphones, laptops, cars—even medical devices) has been made using our equipment."
good,"Work schedule 3-4 days a week, 12/hrs a day. Get paid holidays, the people i work with aren't bad, pretty fun to be around. Their break times are very lax."
good,All it is about extracting maximum work. Most of the managers do not care about their direct reports. They try to extract as much work as possible. They hire and fire at their will.
good,"Working at Lam Reseach is just fine. Employees are good people, management could use some work. Overall it is an alright place to work."
good,"Involved in bug fixing and developing new features for the customer based on different requirements"
good,Lam research is a decent company to work for. All positions are brought in from a local Temp agency. They allow 2 years of Temp work to prove yourself for a full time position. Benefits are great.
good,"a typical day of work would involve meeting the customer to co-ordinate the days tasks and review the previous days ones."
good,Excellent place to work with an up and growing company. The groups are extremely high pressure in a good way. This is a multi-CAD company
good,The benefits here by being hired rather than temp are phenomenal. The only thing i disagree with is the management style that is incorporated here and is very high stress most of the time.
good,"This company has potential for big growth but it seems to be reactionary to processes and trends vs.  being proactive or"
good,"pretty much covered it in the summary, but management = the suck."
good,One of the very few companies in India that work on Semi conductor industry related softwares
good,"Lam Research is a high tech company driven by results and a strong desire to appeal to its customers.  The company is very aware of its market position and maintains an aggressive and effective program to ensure and or promote market place dominance. The bonus rewards are good for employees.  The strategy for excellence is depends on brute force as much as on wisdom or creativity. Long hours are expected, and short hours, i.e. less than 50 hours per week do not lead to good reviews. The majority of fellow employees and managers are top notch and great to work with.  The stated core values are excellent, but their implementation is inconsistent and subject to politics. One senior director stated that ""we don't need smart people - just ones who will work hard."""
good,"Typically require to review he deviation for any changes for supplier to ship the product to LAM, failure analysis report by supplier, 8D report submitted by supplier to review root cause and any corrective actions or implementation taken, meetings with BU on issues related to failure at field or manufacturing plant or specification improvement.  Supplier audit and management at site. Supply chain related issues. Review first article report, supplier presentation on new technology, Six sigma on DOE."
good,"The people were nice, but I found that I did not enjoy working in an engineering enviroment.  I was used to a sales/marketing environment."
good,"Operation sequence and processes in the manufacturing, fabrication of parts, components, sub-assemblies and final assemblies."
good,Everything is outsourced. You interface Vendors mostly. Management is good however your interaction is with Vendors. It's a serious environment and all business.
good,"Have over 35 years working around high voltage between the Air Force and the semiconductor industry. Got fired for safely after successfully performing a task requested by my supervisor to remove a temperature controller off an older system that I was unfamiliar with and the safety protocols regarding the section of the tool where the task was performed.  After getting my hand slapped and receiving safety training, they terminated me anyway.  We are all just human, and are going to make mistakes, especially when the training comes after you needed it.  I read an article by a prominent business man who said he wouldn't hire a person who hasn't made mistakes, because that's how we get better."
good,"Not much engagement from Superior management. They lack professionalism towards each individual. They are very selective on who they work with and talk to. I have tried multiple time to reach out and discuss opportunities but little to no interaction. "
good,"Culture is different. Has free coffee and oatmeal for breakfast.  Nice campus, not very good acupuncture benefit. No work life balance during the week.  Heavy emails and interruptions all day long."
good,I learned a great deal of operational experience and management skill. Job was very fun but hardest part was lack of career advancement within organization.
good,"Very professional environment with great floor support from management. However, there are no warning for breaking protocol or making a critical mistake."
good,Lam Research is a strong company with an excellent product mix and experienced engineers. The work day is tough with many meetings and getting alignment with people can be challenging. The most difficult part of working in lam is the escalation culture which favors the loudest voice. This also allows decisions to be prioritized so the good out weighs the bad. Overall a good place to work but lacking in work/life balance as many companies in the semi industry.
good,"Lam is in the very cyclical semiconductor, capital equipment industry, that means every few years they will be hiring a lot of people and then a few years after that they will be firing them.  You need to accept that if you take a job there.  The high margins and cyclicality of the industry translates to average salary + excellent bonus, profit sharing, stock compensation potential.  When times are good, the profits get shared.  Their is a hierarchical, militaristic, good old boy, structure to senior management which translates to a fast moving environment for employee's.  It is interesting work and you will learn, though not as much maybe as at a smaller less will established company.  In the boom phase you will be working hard because you are in a boom, in the bust phase you will be working hard because a lot of people got laid off and you are understaffed."
good,"Nach dem Abschluss, diese ist meinen ersten Job und ich hatte sehr gute Erfahrung."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,"good hours and profitable rewarding company"
good,LAM was for me a super boring place to work as an FSE. You can't make any troubleshooting decisions yourself rather you must refer to the official troubleshooting procedures. If you want your troubleshooting skills to die this is the place for you.
good,"Great co-workers, pay, and benefits.  A great deal of time is spent wasted on non-value added work.  Culture of not solving problems that then lead to non-valued added work.  weak business processes"
good,"temp to hire only when starting in warehouse unless you are hired for a specific position, for example manager, etc 12 hour days, open 24/7, got nothing more to say"
good,"Caution not to get trapped in a sched you don't like. MFG hrs are 24/7 and fast-paced. Fun place to work tho, depending on your managers in your dept. Great stock options."
good,"My typical day at work is that I come in at 5 am and clock in, then I dress up in full clean room gown and go to my work zone.  I get a passdown on what has been accomplished during the night shift and then I pick up where they left off.  I have learned that nothing is perfect and that there are flaw every step of the way, some issues can be solved at the technician level, others cannot be solved.  The management has been very good, I know who my supervisors are and they care about how well I do.  The hardest part of my job is following instructions that are not very clear.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to solve some troubleshooting problems that others might not be able to."
good,"A typical day is supporting our customer in the installment and sustaining of manufacturing equipment. Duties can also include product development with the customer, writing of procedures, and assisting in program management."
good,"Great Experience, Supporting, I don't have a lot of paid work experience. I have spent most of my time outside of college and graduate school doing volunteer work at a private elementary school in my town. Because the summers are so short, and I was working to complete my certification, I wanted to gain hands-on experience without worrying about finding a school that would hire me. Now that I am certified, finished with my master's degree program, and have all those volunteer hours under my belt, I feel well prepared to take on a full-time."
good,"I worked as an intern in Lam Research. I was well compensated, encouraged to explore my areas of interest within the company, and had a very likable and supportive manager. The downside for me was that the other employers were almost all in their mid 30's or older, making it hard for me to really connect with them and form friendships (given that I was 21 at the time)."
good,I've learned a lot working for Lam and have enjoyed the people I have worked with. The benefit package has served me well. Many opportunities to take on a leadership role.
good,"Great at designing and manufacturing equipment.  Poor at developing and using efficient business processes."
good,You have to be a quick learner. Culture is mixed. Management wants fast-paced workers. Place to learn a lot. Must be clean. Look out for accidents to happen and what to do when it happens. Enjoyable part is when you completed your build on time.
good,"Lam has great opportunities, and pays well...But I have seen almost every Temp employee be cut just before a production ramp up. You will be well compensated, if you can survive."
good,"lack in converting to permanent , no vacation, no insurance , training was horrible , no supervisor communication, no lead no guidance. holiday are only paid for certain days. its a great job but many little flaws to deal with"
good,"I worked at Lam Research for 2 months. The pace was fast and highly technical. It was a bit of a good old boy culture, but not as bad as other places I have been."
good,"company is in the middle of another huge expansion so everything is changing right now. "
good,Long hours be prepared to travel on short notice. Training is typically OJT. Requires a lot guessing on company policies and procedures.
good,Learn more knowledge.Regarding data entry.Delivery and shipping receiving.
good,"Day to day work is rather easy. If in assembly you are installing components or cabling for most the day, and if in test you are setting up and calibrating flow rates and teaching robots. All the people are very kind and good to work with. The benefits are really good and they have a fitness reimbursement program which is nice."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,"productive and fun. I learn a lot, management are cool, job was easy hardest part dealing with some people with taking advantage of there powers and too much conflict of interest."
good,LAM is a work place I would recommend to a friend of family member. Workplace culture is good. Managers and employees are very receptive. There are a lot of opportunities for growth. We have one lunch and three breaks. I work as a Temp with Superior for almost a year now and I find it a great place to be. I am still look because I need a day shift job. As a temp. at LAM you are not entitle to benefits.
good,work/life sucked. my supervision would not help in career advancement. Had to twist arms or leave our group to be given any opportunities. Luckily they have great benefits
good,"regular reviews, bonus checks, good benefits"
good,"Very pleasant environment"
good,"I worked on the manufacturing floor and we would have our morning meeting and get to work on what we have whether it be slow or packed."
good,"Lam has excellent senior leadership and hardworking employees. However, middle-management often forget about the same core values they scold you about and prevent senior leadership in the company from being able to truly groom and grow the talent that shows up on the manufacturing floor."
good,"Everyone on my shift helped out. During 12hrs shift techs will start the module, troubleshoot if need be, and complete module at the time allowed. Most of the techs I worked with have vast knowledge of the products."
good,"Fast-paced work environment.  As a process engineering technician you are responsible for the operation of multiple deposition tools and have to report back to several process engineers.  The fact that the job is in research and development makes it less monotonous but since you are playing a supporting role, the decision-making part of the job is done by higher-ups."
good,Typical day starts with reviewing the tools progress. Figure out where the tool is and what the next building step is and if all the parts are there to continue building.
good,"Pay is good, which makes it difficult to leave.  Some groups are decent but other groups need significant improvement.  Extremely long hours with no appreciation for the effort."
good,The easiest assembly job ever. A great place for those who is looking for that easy money. 12 hour shift rotational. 4 days a week then 3 days a week. Manager and supervisor are rarely seen on the manufacturer's floor. Might be good thing for some people but not me. The communication with manager and supervisor sucks. No room for growth. They will hire you and expect you to do the same job forever
good,"Fulfilling job is you can handle the stress. "
good,"very friendly working environment"
good,"I have been with Lam for just over a year and have enjoyed the work.  Employees are driven, and most have a strong professional attitude.  Work life balance can be a challenge, but the overall culture provides a positive work environment."
good,"Overall, Lam is a good company.  Reactive instead of proactive though. Some departments better than others.  Most treat employees with respect.  Good co-workers."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,Co-workers are very helpful.No restriction on Work hours.
good,"excellent company to work for, fast moving and very stable."
good,"The culture at LAM Research has always been positive for me and I have been there 3 years. I like the 12 hour shifts and supervision has always treated us fairly and with respect, good exposure to real time troubleshooting issues."
good,"Long hours, on three days, off for four, on for 4 days, off for 3. Pretty good insurance options. Could do better with Christmas/ New Years shut downs for all employees."
good,"Lam is a company that starts with contract work and then moves you to full time if the industry is doing well and can take more people so be ready for that.  Depending on your shift and management, the work life is tons of fun or can be very strict.  Overall Lam is a good company to be with."
good,Needs improved business process to support growth. Management is not supportive of grass root improvement. Lam is top down management and is very bureaucratic. Many meetings have no purpose.
good,Good place to work but has the ups and downs of any semiconductor company. Good work environment and teamwork. Management is fair. Lot of interactions with cross-functional teams and suppliers as well.
good,"Not a so stressful place to work, good benefits and ok pay but you can't move up unless you kiss a... or have really good connections. This place almost never lays off their regular full time employees, unless you screwed up badly and get fired. The starting pay is ok but as you move on, living expenses increase but your raise can't compete with it"
good,"Lam is OK.  They made a mistake on distribution of responsibilities with me, but I assume it was not a normal practice of managing departments. Lam purchased Novellus System in which I was part of. They had a lot of problems implementing two company systems."
good,"Working at Lam is definitely more rewarding for some than others. Working in the clean room becomes rather repetitive, but opportunities to advance or transfer within the company do exist. Great job to work while pursuing higher education, as well. "
good,"Usually, when I get on the floor, I just check the tools' status. Once the previous shift left, I assign my team a task and their daily goal. After that, I just need to make sure if they have enough material to complete the task I assigned."
good,"As product engineer, a typical day of work includes managing internal and customer-driven escalation projects as well as working on product development. Management expects product engineers to drive projects forward quickly and effectively, and some travel can occur if the projects involve customers. Work-life balance is manageable for the most part with occasional periods of long work hours either at office or at home."
good,"Generally, most teams and people are very pleasant to be around, even if you don't fancy some people, it's hard to find outright bad, rude, or unpleasant people. Unless you're the one causing trouble."
good,There was room for advancement and a good atmosphere within the company and co-workers.All the job instructions were easy to work with and the days were filled with different challenges that required ones attention to complete each task in the best way possible
good,A nice environment to work with. Flexible working schedule. The company let you work remotely 1-2 days during weekday if you lives far away from the company
good,"good teamwork. "
good,Good place to work.  Free lunches.  Good hours and it is very close to where I live.  In Tualatin so plenty of places to shop get gas and restaurants.
good,"Great place to work with friendly staff"
good,"Great company with a lot of growth and advancement.  Benefits are excellence.  Great time to work here if you are ambitious, and self motivated.  Expect a lot of OT."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,"Lam Research's tagline is ""where successful people want to work!"".They offer generous benefits, excellent training and personal development. They are a very stable company and is performing well financially."
good,"This company is in its infancy and has a lot of growing up to do to keep up with the current boom time it is experiencing.  Basic manufacturing discipline is lacking,  not as much accountability as needed for success and quality systems could be greatly improved."
good,"Good work place culture"
good,"My job morphed into being on the road over 80% of the time."
good,I am in a position where I provide customer service to customers and employees on a daily basis. Employees are very friendly and helpful which allows for a positive and productive work place.
good,"When working shift and covering contract job, the schedule is set and very stable, with the exception of covering co-workers PTOs or monthly meetings. "
good,"Address any and all issues with whatever the current project might be. dealing with manufactures, vendors, machine shops, sheet metal shops, issues on the floor pretty much anything that arose."
good,"Lam is a super fast pace semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment  for Deposition, Etch and others.  The work culture at Lam is unique although very demanding. However your job is backed up by resources, tools and systems which make your daily responsibilities easier to accomplish."
good,Traditional work place. 8-5 job room for learning but not much room for growth. Hardest part was adapting to continually new colleagues as veterans keep leaving the company. Taking over their job responsibilities until a new person got hired on.
good,"	Duties and Responsibilities require me to work on problems of diverse scope where analysis of data requires evaluation of identifiable factors.  Exercises judgment within generally defined practices and policies in selecting methods and techniques for obtaining solutions. Electronic system troubleshooting, mechanical aptitude, good communication skills, and the ability to deal effectively with customers e.g. Engineers and Technicians on the floor, postmortems, meetings, conferences, passdowns, lessens learned and escalations."
good,"Very Dynamic company, busy people but a nice bunch of folks. Management is tight and sometimes confusing, goods days and bad days, can't tell. The machines are chemically complicated but the parts are simple. Not a space shuttle."
good,"the good company cares about safety well being and friendly happy environment."
good,"Company is looking out for employees, friendly and supportive. Good benefits, employment security, safety awareness priority. Opportunity for advance career ."
good,"Dynamic environment , where you can be heard and work as part of a larger team.  Must is demanded of you , and you can demand a lot of others. Driven to succeed, good compensation"
good,"Lam Research is a very generous and welcoming place to work at. They provide benefits as well competitive pay upon entering their workforce. Lam Research staff are well equipped to help you learn your job smoothly and efficiently, so you can work on advancing to a higher position as well as immediately becoming a valuable asset to Lam  Research."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a morning meeting and review of manufacturing progress.  Expectations are set and as the day goes on communication of disturbances is encouraged to manage those expectations.  Each day presents it's own unique set of challenges.  Management is open and looks at those challenges as opportunities to improve the manufacturing process and is receptive to suggestions ."
good,Great place to work. Supervisors are really nice and culture is open. Everyone is really easy to communicate with. I learned alot about corporation tax.
good,"Too much travel and limited flexibility."
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,"Great place to learn and grow. This large matrixed company has many avenues of growth and promotion. Being an industry heavyweight, its benefits and compensation is competitive to its rivals."

good,"I have always received necessary support from other teams as and when needed. Very good team and client to work for."
good,"Great company to work for! Good opportunities to grow within the company."
good,"Very happy with co-worker, and good management, learned a lot from there."
good,Great place to grow and thrive. Forward thinking and progressive. Cutting edge technology. Wish I still worked at Lam
good,"Lam Research is a gem of a company to work for. Strong management, great products with many good people working there. Top minds in the industry are attracted to this company from a technical standpoint."
good,Responsibilities were for two ST Micro Electronics sites.
good,Lam was an exciting place to be employed. This is a dynamic company that allows employees to grow and take the lead on development of new technoilogies.
good,"Lam has good focus on technology development and innovation.   Generally good adherence to core values of achievement orientation and teamwork.   Recently there are more managers from the Novellus side, and they tend to be more political and focused on their personal gain."
good,employees are well compensated and corporate planning is second to none. very fast paced culture with ever changing priorities.   communication to all levels especially the field is very slow.
good,"Great colleagues but direction from top down is still highly reactive to customer excursions and demands, which produces boom and bust cycles, which limits its ability to proactively plan for the future and overall injects a layer of uncertainty to planning, management structures, and being able to innovate for the future."
good,Requires dedication to Lams core values and customer trust. As account manager there are always some job related requirements even when on vacation. You are expected to react to customer needs regardless of the situation
good,its very good company to life and work balance. the only think is you have to follow the way things done and not out of the box thinking allowed for contractor. you cannot make decision and you need to follow the way things done.  That been said I was there for one year so I understand where they come from.
good,"It was a very technical job. However, for anyone with a technical background the job was manageable. The only drawback for myself was working in manufacturing, which can be repetitive."
good,A typical day at work would be building prototypes of new semiconductors. I learned how to work with people such as engineer design groups. The management was above average. The workplace culture was good. The people were nice and kind. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting. The most enjoyable part was the discounted lunch for the employees.

good,"Truly a wonderful company to work for, very relaxed environment and great people to work with. Competitive salary with great benefits but with the rising prices of living in Oregon, not a livable salary without a duel income."
good,Challenging workplace full of excellent employees and knowledgeable leads. Enjoyed the challenge of working in a clean room environment. Many different types of   equipment to learn and operate on.
good,A typical day at work is 8 to 5:30. Standard job that requires patience and hard work. Easy going tech engineers and business people make up the office population. Sometime we get treated with free food. Overall good experience.
good,"端看遇到的客戶是甚麼，如果是Tsmc就很麻煩，他們都會專門針對vendor"
good,"the dedication of management to improve and allow growth is exceptional. Customer core values, dedicated to fulfill the customers expectations while providing guidance and training for employees"
good,The people are really good to work with and there is a lot of semiconductor experience among the senior technicians. Complex troubleshooting is part of the day to day routine and there is a steep learning curve for new technicians due to minimal training. Not very many opportunities to move up in the company without changing departments. Technical ability is not weighted very heavily during evaluations.
good,Learning the aspects and precisions of manufacturing. Specific calibrations and quality inspection.  Well teamed and organized management.  Detailed rule out of descriptive job duties and responsibilities.   Great workers and team on production and meeting all company goals.
good,"Good place to work, if you like working minimum 50 hours a week.Super high paced industry, that even through downturns keeps the workforce leans and extremely busy."

good,Great place to work if you love technology. Gets to be faced paced. Lots of area to learn and build your resume with. Safety is always first priority.

good,"this was a good place to work for.  I enjoyed the interactions with coworkers and managers.  I was happy in my job and this job launched my interest and career in training. "
good,My shift was from 5:00 am to 5:30 pm. It was fairly easy to get used to the 12 hour work day. The one on one training made it easy to learn the job correctly. Pay was satisfactory and they offer overtime.
good,"Great company, generally cares about their employees, however, the difficulties of the industry force some stressful time requirements on employees. Additionally, the recent rapid growth has lead so some lack of leadership for new employees."
good,I am a temp employee here at Lam. I really enjoy the environment on my shift. Most of the folks I work with are fantastic and fun to work with. The work is interesting and sometimes rather challenging.
good,"Lam is a good place to work. Everyone from the managers to the engineers are friendly and helpful. Lam has good benifits and pay their employees very good,"
good,"I am a contractor at Lam but I heard it has good benefits.  However, it is very crowded and it seems Lam prefer to keep consultants (temporary contractors) for more than a year without converting them to regular employees."

good,worked in summer 2015. positive attitude of employees and balance in work. no free lunch provided. management is pretty well organized.

good,"A great place to work, people are really nice"

good,"It's low stress low pay"
good,"As someone pursuing a software career, it is clear that Lam is well behind on that front. And they know it. They are trying their best to fix this issue, but the fact that it is a hardware oriented company slows the transition down. "

good,This place was a work in progress and department kept changing and continued to meet expectations and adapt to new industry standards. Very challenging and great culture to be a part of
good,"It was  a fun place to work with the swing shift team and lead. Day shift workers mostly are the same race so they cover each other's mistakes. The day shift surpervisor had her favorites and you could tell right away. Co-workers that have been there for years would tell me how unfair she would be. But over all, once all day shift workers left it was stress free and fun. I loved working there."
good,Nice place to work. Really enjoyed my time here. Flexible working hours and welcoming atmosphere. Good company stocks . Very diversified work environment.

good,A whole new world in terms of the scale of a large scale company and the process it requires to operate it. Management would also listen to new ideas for ease of operations if they needed changes.
good,When I worked at Lam the culture wasn't very good. Previous management was very rude and unprofessional. Lam has grown a lot and there is a lot of opportunities to advanced your career.
good,Great publicly traded company to work for. Employees and staff communicate well. Company is moving forward and there is always something to work on.
good,"Good for engineering jobs, bad for manufacturing positions, not fair in providing opportunities to grow, more friendship-ish rules to promote rather than competency, military-dominated HR"
good,Lam Research is a great place to work! Amazing people guided by solid core values. It is fun to be directly involved in cutting edge technology that will change the world as we know it.
good,I enjoyed my time at Lam in Boise. The upside was the pay and my colleagues. The downside is not just about Lam but more about the semiconductor industry as a whole in that it is cyclical which results in frequent layoffs.
good,"The job was great but due to a major customer going back on their order of tools the whole factory is in a shut down mode.i worked with tools to get them tested so no defects were found, and if there were we would fix then so the customer would have a fully operational tool arriving to them and would be ready to produce micro-chips."
good,"Amazing group of people, very nice company. Even though it was a 24 hour operation everyone gets two days off for thanksgiving and Christmas. I was laid off do to lack of work because i was a contractor. They blindly laid off some great workers with no notice. They even promised us the week before they were not doing lay offs, beware of that. Otherwise they pay well, are very open to raises and have lots of room to grow and succeed. Try to get hired on as a LAM employee, then you get vacation pay."
good,"After giving 2 yrs to Lam, I was not part of getting converted to full time employment as expected. They are good at training but lack many management skills needed to help people succeed in moving up the ladder."
good,"Great Manager and Place to work. Life work balance is important to all that work at Lam Research. Fast Paced, yet rewarding place to work, Good efforts are always rewarded ---"
good,I enjoyed my time working for LAM. There were times when my schedule wasn't consitent and that made it difficult for family life.
good,"Achievement is highly rewarded   Employees are ranked across a department for purposes of pay raises and bonuses"
good,"Was a great culture, but then our group disbanded and took other jobs.   There was a downturn in the industry so we had to look elsewhere.   I wish that I had stayed.  IT was a great company."
good,the job is productive and stress full but overall a great company. they will help you grow in what ever way is possible. no experience needed( on the job training).

good,I had a great time working for Lam Research. It was a great experience working in a semiconductor industry.  Fast-paced industry but the pay was good. Learning many skills from this job
good,The job itself was occasionally quite physically demanding in the Clean Room. The condensed work schedule was also pretty tough with 12.5 hour shifts making sleep difficult during the workweek. An excellent introduction to the semiconductor manufacturing space. Excellent esprit-de-corps with fellow employees.
good,"This company offers great benefits and work life balance, fun place to work at with supportive management."
good,"Area Coordinator."

good,Lam is one of the best work places yet.. ideal work shift.. Training process is great... I would recommend and would return too work for this employer...
good,"Great place to work, best job I've ever had.  Very demanding, often tasked with Service Requests above your equipment knowledge level.  The compressed work week schedule is nice.  Was enjoyable to work at a company where sharing knowledge with the new techs is a normal thing, not the typical place where your value is based on what you know that others don't.  It was easy for a person like me to openly share and train others on process and equipment knowledge."
good,"If a department mistakenly hired an incompetent manager who played games by presenting fake data to mess around, that could cause company to lose valuable resources."
