bad,AGCO as a company doesn't value their employers. Only the dollar they can make. The company shut down its doors putting around 89 fulltime workers out of a job and countless temps and moved location to two hours away.
bad,"This place is high stress, very poorly unorganized scheduling, the demands that are put on the workers are unreasonable to the people who work on the production floor but the people who create the scheduling have no adverse effects on there work scheduling and demands on their lives to the point the job consumes much of your time for months on end then the scheduling is so poor that the work time required drops to 32 hours per week or furlough time. Which makes it very stressful financially."
bad,Dont like the fact that they habitually layoff workers every year. No matter if the person is an asset to the team if your number is up its up. There is a better way.
bad,"The accounting group is like a plantation. Their objective is to work you to death with little compensation and ZERO room for advancement and or recognition. "
bad,Will not hire temps at flora IL plant only 10.00 bucks hour not worth your time! Management doesn't care either so there you go they need more Indians to many chiefs another thing winter time is breeze summer time gets 105 degrees or more In there!
bad,"this job was a waste of my six months. After being hired on full time, they laid me off one week later citing ""market instability""..."
bad,Management doesn't care about workers they only hire you on full time if you sleep with a boss. Only work here if you have too. Agco/Gsi has to be the worse ran company I've ever worked for.
bad,"Agco is a very horrible company to work for in every sense. People in supervisory position has no integrity. People in supervisory position enlist the help of others to makes up lies to get people they do not like fired. No policies/procedures in place. Human resource is a disgrace. Supervisors are inappropriate and when you report to human resources, they find a way to get rid of you. Internal audit does not exist and what they have in place is any acctg/auditing/finance person's worst nightmare"
bad,"Hired on July 7 after leaving an 18 year career. By lunch on my first day I was told there was a restructuring in the works. Before the van came to pick up my stuff, it had started. My first week I saw hundreds of employees get let go. My job changed twice before I was in my permanent residence. I had 4 bosses in 6 months, list all the fringe benefits I was offered before I was even moved to my permanent hiplacement"
bad,"I was hired at AGCO and moved to Kansas only to find out on my first day they were having a massive restructuring. I wasn't even out of temporary housing and everything they promised, including the job I was hired to do, was null and void. I watched hundreds of people get let go within the first 90 days of employment.  I left an 18 year tenure at a great company for AGCO. In the end, I left within 8 months. I was going to be out of a job as well. Went through 4 bosses in 6 months."
bad,worst management I've ever worked for I really truly think that my high schooler could run GSI better than the people that are right now!they work so much overtime you can don't have any time to do anything at home. 6 days a week guaranteed thru the summer!
bad,"Being compensated well and treated fairly always depends on who the manager is at this company.  Logistics is not recommended.  There are other departments with a good outlook, like inside sales.  I could not with a good conscience recommend anyone work in Logistics."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at this place. Management sucks and if you're not in the good old boys club or being a  snitch to management you're treated good The ppl that work hard are treated awful.  You're just a number
bad,"If you are a woman, do NOT work for this company. I have nothing more to say about the matter. There is no promotion from within....and their ""woman's networking group"" was used to pad the resumes of c-level management - make it look like it was all about women. The first project? Volunteering to help with a food drive....you know - instead of teaching women to network we are going to have them do clothing drives and food drives and raise money for the community - sound familiar? Unpaid work?"
bad,"The department I worked in was a very hostile environment.  People enjoyed gossiping and making fun of others rather than focusing on work and resolving issues.  People consistently harassed those who wanted to work and learn.  They also used others as scapegoats to cover up their own mistakes.  Management doesn't reward hard work nor respect seniority.  Instead, they allow those who abuse and take advantage of others gets to stay while casting out valuable employees who doesn't follow the crowd."
bad,"There's absolutely No training. They say they have ""training"", but all they do is show you how to put  a component together one time and then you're on your own. And if you make a mistake, they get on you for not being able to produce the hourly quota when you're still trying to learn the process of building the component. And this is all within the first couple of weeks. It's terrible."
bad,"Une boîte de raciste superviseur qui dit pas bonjour et aucune reconnaissance ."
bad,On a typical day you will come in and go into a meeting and the management In lead would talk bad about one employee try to stress out another employee so he or she would have a bad day at work and if you are not there color they would really treat you bad especially visitors from other companies that work for us .a lot of racist and backstabbing at the job . the best part about the job is to go home
bad,poor leadership of the company at the VP level and above.    too much turnover of the good people in the company because it was not a good place to work.
bad,Poor management no career progression. Management with out any knowledge pretends which prohibit others to grow. Work success not measured. Harassment is another fact.
bad,"Way behind where the company needs to be against competition and technology; operating systems, purchasing processes, and procedures. Leadership creates an unnecessary chaotic environment, expect unrealistic deadlines and tasks to be met without failure. Lack of data to collect facts in order to be able to make fact based decisions, despite accomplishing the impossible, when ready to execute you are reminded you have no authority, every decision gets questioned and micro managed, then changed in scope so managers can take credit for the ideas, everyone is in it for themselves and no recognition even for difficult accomplishments that benefits the organization. Managers will not lead, show the path to success, nor help professional development, no new learning opportunities nor advancement opportunities unless you are a friend or in the club. The culture in the purchasing department is toxic, morale is low to the point where people are leaving as soon as they complete their 2 year relocation contract, very high turnover. Individuals are not respected for their expertise and are discouraged to share ideas and keep their opinions to themselves, everyone follows the ""Don't upset the status quo"", it is not broke, let's not upset our comfort level for any improvement mentality, impossible to challenge the stakeholders for breakthrough ideas that will generate value to the organization. Managers approach the employees with a ""The beating continues until moral increases"" mind set and will micro manage. I do not recommend working for AGCO's purchasing department and don't approve of"
bad,Very poor management. People were very negative everything was always a rush because it was either lost or to rusty or people got sent home all the time for lack of work
bad,War hier drei Jahre lang. Wurde geschunden bis zum geht nicht mehr. Kann das niemanden empfehlen. Mfg Herrmann
bad,"Pretty nice d place to work at. Management doesn't have a clue what they're doing tho. And they'll fire people for breaking rules before the tile was implemented. Other than that, great place to work lmfao"
bad,"Up until the time I was hurt I liked my job. Once I was hurt management did everything they could to make my job difficult. They also had their Dr. look at my issue, and said I was fine so they could discontinue my workmans comp claim. I ended up having surgery that I had to pay for on my own. After surgery i was given a month and a half to get back to work at %100, or lose my job. I was unable to recover fast enough, I was called at home and terminated."
bad,"Trabalhei lá quase 10 anos e cada ano que se passava ia acontecendo mudanças mas não para melhorar e sim para piorar, pois não davam nem um incentivo para os funcionários pois só cobravam ecada vez cobram mais."
bad,One of the worst things of working at AGCO is they seem to set you up to fail before you even start. You don't have the right tools not enough parts and then they act like it's your fault and then you have to work overtime because of their stupidity. And all you can get out of management is they point a finger at the other guy and it's his fault. The amount of over educated idiots in management is overwhelming!! Although most of my coworkers we're supportive. But that is not the situation in all areas!!! As far as the United steelworkers Union at AGCO it's A JOKE!!. The amount of layoffs is overwhelming to. I have seen people quit other jobs to come there and work for four months and then lose her job there. Just beware!
bad,This company is terrible.  They lack strategy and direction.  They do not communicate and don't respect their employees.  The positive is that the people are friendly.
bad,The management is the greatest but if youre someone who goes in to work just to work and not worry about anyone else its a good job.
bad,If you are a contractor you can expect to never know what is going on and more than likely you will not know when your last day will be until that day which prevents you from having anything else in place
bad,"Assemble farm machinery,  deal with poor supervision some worthless employees and hope you dont get forced into overtime while the employee besides you is never forced into overtime."
bad,"There is a lot of self interest for position and personal gain. Money over employees makes it cut-throat. Job was ok, hard to get things done because of matrix reporting. All about location over greater good."
bad,"lowest paid Corp in the industry, WILL NOT Give good raises, not even cost of living, biggest raise I have ever gotten is 2 percent over the last 17 years... Time for change people"
bad,"Not told the truth about the job in the interview. Lead person liked to say you don't do anything. Some people in the department did little to nothing other people did alot. Was not told that you work outside all the time. Put in 60 to 70 hours a week, creates not much home life mandatory Saturdays and Sundays management was lost when scheduling trucks"
bad,"In the interview process they proclaim to want change; however, in actuality they do not embrace change, new people, or new ideas"
bad,Some of the questions are unfair due to me being a contract employee. I have no  idea of the benefits or things like that. I was not available for benefits or paid time off.
bad,Stressful cut-throat environment that doesn't value its' employees. No clear career path and extremely competitive environment. Renumeration and compensation is ok.
bad,Enjoyed working with great people all over the world. The opportunity to travel the world and meet new people was a great experience. The company could be more progressive in regards to the work/life balance.
bad,"Management incompetente che agisce solo per proteggere i propri interessi e guidato da scarse competenze."
bad,Not willing to spend money to fix things right just make shift to get by.  The old time bosses new how to run things the college people don't have work experience. Poor  management.
bad,"A company that is very reactive instead of proactive."
bad,The hours in many areas of the plant vary from day to day with little or no advanced notice. The upper management causes most of the problems not only with work load but also with the constant change in hours. Many of the leads/supervisors have bad attitudes and do not care for their employees. The work is not hard but is time consuming.  The supervisors typically do not understand if a person is sick or needing time off for any reason other than a death in the family. I would not recommend this job to anybody.
bad,"Pay is above average for the area."
bad,"Never knew when you might get laid off.work you ten hour days. Sox days a week.  Then lay you off the following monday. If you was buddies with the supervisor, then you got job promotion."
bad,"If you're single and don't care about being home this place is great for you pay is amazing but have very little time to see my wife or just relax. Was told during interview that it was a Monday thru Friday job found out that was a lie it's Monday thru Saturday. Management has no idea what they're doing they'll run you into the ground and bark why you're not making standards which is more than likely set way to high. Most machine shops I worked at precision was the key, not here speed is. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Agco."
bad,AGCO/GSI is a decent place for an entry level welder or anyone working in manufacturing but don't expect and career advancement or good raises. They have really good benefits and great PTO. One thing I always enjoyed was being able to get off with just a 24 hour notice if needed.
bad,"Essendo una multinazionale è forse iperstrutturata a livello gerarchico e per questo non è di facile gestione. Le difficoltà principali per un dipendente è quella di ottenere delle linee guida da seguire."
bad,"A great place to work and retire from. Even if you consider the  corporate culture is alive and well at this company. Contained within the numerous groups I had the pleasure of working with were some outstanding people.  The ones not seeking fame. Yet, were innovative in thought and deed, Those interactions outshined any shortcomings found or seen within the corporate environment. Which to me made all those years at AGCO a pleasure to be a part of.  The true mark of a great company is seen in its people. So, once you dig past the yes people will you find the stars. And I know there are many in the Engineering Group at Hesston."
bad,I would pass on the next opportunity to work at this company. They hired some guy straight out of South America to run the IT Dept and it was very difficult working with him. He would insult you and talk down to you because he knew you were a contractor. He wasn't technical at all and never knew the answer to any question you asked him. I ended being let go after speaking up for myself and the team.
bad,"What's happening now with world grain prices, has caused AGCO to spiral downward as have all agricultural equipment companies. Laying off employees regularly every summer/Christmas."
bad,"Not ever knowing what the hours will be week to week, long furloughs throughout the year. Learned to be very responsible and multitask. Day is very busy because a lot of the time it is only me running 6 machines and trying to keep them going. I enjoy the work, especially if I had the help I needed. Good people to work around. there is a disconnect however between management and the floor workers. A lot of people need extra hands to do their job."
bad,this place was pretty good to work for.  I had got along with all the management and employees. they acutally paid pretty good back in the day when i was there.
bad,"A normal day at AGCO includes a great deal of crisis management. The entire product flow is broken. The company needs to focus on delivery dates, then establish requirement dates for each of the components that flows into the end product. This needs to back all the way up to ordering raw material in a timely manner. Inventory management is key to any success AGCO expects to have in the future."
bad,"J'ai démarré en tant qu'inspecteur commercial MF espace vert."
bad,"I never heard please and thank you from management, leads, and other such important roles. Feeling like a number and strict attendance guidelines which didn't leave room for emergency family circumstances made me feel like I wasn't appreciated and that your family really came in 2nd place. I did however learn so much much from select team leads and supervisors that it really made me work the hardest I could and made each day worth while and knowing you make a difference is the only reason I want to go to work everyday."
bad,Upper management talks to you like you are stupid. The culture among coworkers is very toxic and abusive. I've never experienced such behavior in my entire working life.
bad,"Leadership changing - will be changing again in 2 years or less, due to CEO leaving - does not have a long term focus, as senior leadership will not be there long term"
bad,AGCO used to be a good place to work. But changed after 5 years. This about all I can say about AGCO at this time. I did't like it went they changed the work-from-home policy. Now they require people to come to the office.
bad,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar pois é uma multinacional e oferece bons beneficios e remunaração. No entanto, poucas oportunidades de promoção."
bad,The work is great. the management team is very poor. they only think about themselves and not employees. they are very short staffed and still expect the same productivity
bad,"Intimidating,hot environment;80 mile drive;no rewards or praise for good job,layoffs during holidays."
bad,"Very stressful and over resorting at times. Work four ten hour shifts which I do love, gives me more time for my family. I pick tractor parts which is sometimes heavy. I have done both shipping and receiving also ups manifest."
bad,"The ag equipment manufacturing and ag markets are in a dump right now. "
bad,"What you are told and what you get are, as usual, completely different. Its not a terrible place to work and the welding was quite enjoyable. The management, however, seems to be somewhat unethical as I was assured a permanent position, which was terminated mid training for no reason!"
bad,"Agco is one of those companies that over builds and works the living day lights out of you, that pays you well but then turns around and hands out lay off notice to you. Not very fun. but if they are pumping and you want to work get your money."
bad,"Falta de competência e de respeito  das chefias  ( gerência, liderança e facilitadores)."
bad,"Agco contracted my employment through MA contract house. Supervisor, Agco engineer, un(able/willing) providing landline phone to his supporting conntract  engineers.  Told day 1, register your cell # with AGCO secretary for all work communication (subsidize AGCO).  Little to no 2G T-MOBILE cell coverage.  Communication suffered work product suffered and contract ended."
bad,as áreas administrativas se parecem muito com empresas públicas. São lentas e não aplicam nenhum conceito moderno de gestão e execução
bad,"Nice place to work but in Heston, KS where nothing else exists and the competition is tough with John Deer taking the market share."
bad,Supervisor and Management is not fair.They have favoritism among their inner circle.
bad,"high production rate, enjoyed working hard. but didn't like having to deal with the union. Was able to prove myself and was able to move and learn other areas"
bad,The company is very good to their employees and provides very good moral support along with excellent education for all of the employees.
good,"good company but bad on parts shipping quality is poor,tool equipment is poor"
good,I was part of the stock crew and I did was put the parts away all day
good,"Bad management, day shift would mess up and nights get the blame, job security is terrible never have a day where I didn't think they'd lay me off, bad"
good,Pay was good but what came with was not worth it insurance was garbage job security depended on who liked you not your work performance higher ups should not be where they are at
good,"Foi uma experiência muito boa pois o que eu estava aprendendo na faculdade acabei vendo na prática como o sistema Just in time que se divide em Sistema Cambam de reposição de peças.A parte difícil do trabalho era a estrutura física da empresa que não comportava a quantidade de matérias que chegavam a todo instante, e a parte agradável foi o aprendizado em si."
good,"Performed DevOps for Linux, Unix and Windows platform environments. "
good,AGCO is a good workplace with great coworkers. The work is not strenuous at all. You can learn of great things in the warehouse and take it somewhere else.
good,Não são de dar muitas oportunidades de crescimento pessoal
good,The benefits are not bad. As far as pay and management they have alot to be desired. They had a major layoff this year and the workload is doubled for the rest of us. They are not know for the wages they pay.
good,Management seems lost most of the time.  Communication is horrible.  No one ever gets a promotion without leaving and coming back.  Technology is a decade behind the rest of the world.  Company only cares about bottom dollar.
good,"The employee benefits are great, but the culture is from the dark ages, very discriminating unless you belong to the ""in"" group. You will not advance here unless you are friends with current managers or related to current managers. It is a job that will pay decent and get you by but don't plan on a prosperous career unless you are willing to just be a follower."
good,"As any job had its greats and its bad, learned a lot from certain co-workers, learned a new trade and had fun doing it. Management had more lows than ups got along with my super but had some issues with other immature younger ones and that felt threatened by any of my ideas or took it upon themselves to take the credit for ideas that were not even theirs type of issues. the hardest part would have had to be the amount of hand unloading that one person had to endure in a shift but it was part of the job. The most I liked was the fun and something new every day with the actual Laser machines themselves."
good,AGCO if very competitive with pay but the work load is almost ridiculous.  Company is structured very flat so do not expect to move up the ladder any time soon.  Negotiate your pay and seniority coming in
good,"Overall good experience and advancement through taking multiple roles and actively driving initiatives, projects and requests to conclusion."
good,"Very knowledgeable and professional staff. Global foot print and overall good quality products, Limited resources and lack of strategic vision increases pressure on mid level management to deliver on very high expectations. 3 re-organizations in past 4 years impact staff morale."
good,"AGCO has had its challenges over the years as the farm industry has declined. There has been a lot of turnover, and it is just not as fun to work there as it was when the industry was strong. The culture varies across departments. Compensation is OK as are the benefits. 2.5/5 stars"
good,"I refuse to write a review on AGCO corporation, as I am still employed with the company, and will not relinquish any information that could be inadvertently used against me for any reason.  I plead the 5th."
good,"Im Allgemeinen ein durchschnittlicher Betrieb."
good,"Good place to work, just that management doesn't seem to care much about their employees family lives. I really enjoy my fellow coworkers"
good,"Employees were not treated well or respected by management. We lost over half of our employees in our dept (12 to 4). even when the company was really growing. "
good,A typical day at AGCO is just that typical. We go in for the morning meetings then we go about our business. We sub up parts for the combines then try to get them moving down the line as quick and effective as possible.
good,Team meeting in morning. Check out equipment for work.
good,"Empresa Boa, se não fosse as baixas qu ela tem em massa,  seria ótima"
good,poste de travail adapter aux condition de travail.
good,"Empresa em constante mudança, visando a necessidade do cliente e oferecendo soluções tecnológicas para o agricultor."
good,"A great place to work with competitive benefits, good pay. The PTO offered is not great as they do no take your previous experience into consideration when including that in a job offer. Peachtree Industrial Blvd traffic is pretty bad during the school year as parents all funnel it to try to take their kids to the many schools nearby to AGCO."
good,"People and company culture good, leadership not very competent. Strangely dysfunctional place to work."
good,O estagiário entra na empresa e é esquecido. Fica somente com o que o contratou para ajudá-lo e sem um plano estruturado para os estagiários. Os funcionários enxergam os estagiários como ameaça.
good,This company was fun to work for.  They helped me a lot with learning many new concept of the industry. Work/life balance was good.
good,"The position held there was one that included a very wide range of duties ranging from being the main GOTO for CO2 LASER cutting and other machinery issues, to grinding concrete floors. It seemed the more one would concentrate and in fact make the production machinery more efficient, the more facility work such as floor grinding there was to do? After a few years it became obvious this was the general method of operation for the department. Considering this limited room for advancement, and the fact there were some very time consuming personal issues that had come up outside of the workplace, the decision was made to resign from the position and, for a time, focus on the major life changes that seemed to be insistent."
good,"AGCO has some great brands and amazing loyal and experienced professionals.  The management unfortunately lack good management skills, in particular at the very senior level.  They have created a not so nice culture and always in consistent"
good,AGCO has a very laid back environment with flexible working hours. The people are very courteous and friendly. Commuting to and from the office is very short as there is very little traffic to the office.
good,Worked 1st shift for almost a year. Wasn't a bad place to work except for the management and production teams have no communication making it very annoying to try and work. Everyone was angry that early in the morning (5am) and the union and the company don't work very well. Good Pay though.
good,It’s a good company I just wish you could hire onto 1st shift instead of having to start on second shift. The supervisors could be a little more involved in a positive way
good,"Respectable place to work. They have a strong Saftey program.  Quality workmanship is sometimes overlooked at the corporate level, and quantity is recognized from other offshore sister manufacturing sites."
good,"It was a great opportunity to learn about agricultural equipment."
good,"Very busy place to work"
good,Work environment is good they try to hire qualified personnel. Not much is given for career advancement. Job descriptions change with out notice.
good,"Very orginized, Numerous triaining opertunities to enrty level personnel. Management Team very helpful. Co workers professional for those who want to be there. Collecting parts needed for Daily assembly. Daily Challenges and end of the shift satisfaction of a quality product that will be delievered to customers. With high expectations of Prouducts Delievered on site."
good,"Ótima jornada semanal de trabalho;"
good,"Empresa bem conceituada, vivência com sistemas de qualidade e o dia a dia de uma grande empresa, não possuo suficiente suficiente para comentar sobre diretoria-gerência, boa relação interpessoal com bom resultado em trabalho de equipe, um ritmo as vezes muito acelerado de trabalho, o grupo, ambiente de trabalho."
good,"I was out there for 10 years and I enjoyed it except for the lay offs, management was fair and in some cases very helpful. I enjoyed working there but I wont be going back"
good,The job was hard at first but I am a fast learner and I was able to get a Handle on it fairly quickly. The only issue I had was the constant squabbling between first and second shift.
good,"My experience with AGCO was fair. Management and HR played favorites, made assumptions, led unfounded investigations against employees and fostered a hostile environment"
good,Very stressful environment. Ran by men and not a place for advancement. The benefits are decent but you the work life balance is difficult in certain departments.
good,"Appreciate the working relationship between the Union and Corporate. A place you could retire from. Aside from the lack of a steady production schedule, and having to deal with the state unemployment policies and procedures, the Heston site is a good work place."
good,"One of the best opportunities of working at AGCO is the ability to have an meaningful impact on the products they produce. A new product engineer has the ability to design hundreds of components/assemblies. "
good,"The benefits are wonderful. Management needs a little work, but overall its a good company to work for. I believe the company can help internal people training and more opportunity to succeed."
good,i wouldn't really recommend working here.  it's not the best company to work at as they do budget cuts regularly it seems and let you go without warning.
good,Pretty good pay. Worst con about ago is your treated like a number instead of a person because of the amount of people they employ. If your productiv and their every day you are rewarded appropriately. Management is shady a lot of turn over
good,People where good to work with. Benefits were good. Stress full at times. Over time was there when needed. Worked well with managers. Incentives where good.
good,This place is ok i worked there for a year before they had a massive lay off. They put people on furlows before laying people off but it wasnt enough.
good,It's pretty much what you expect a seasonal ag equipment manufacturer to be.  Radical overtime requirements. It's a big company and there is potential to advance.
good,"Boa empresa de se trabalhar, ponto mais difícil era a falta de estabilidade."
good,great people to work with. terrible management and human resources. to much small town politics. very cliquish. union was a joke. they didn't care about employees.
good,"I only worked for the company for a short period. They seemed to have their warehouse well organized and knew what was going on.  Their employees were very friendly and helpful. It wasn't the job for me, but it was for sure a nice place to experience."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, investe alto em tecnologia, porém sofre muito com as variações no mercado."
good,"Nuevos conocimientos, mayor experiencia."
good,"Empresa com um ambiente agradável de se trabalhar, pois os funcionários de todos os setores contribuem para isso."
good,Ag business is slow so production and assembly is slow. Have laid off recently and more layoffs are to come. Currently furloughing employees also.
good,A very good place to work. The company was very flexible in the schedule. Always fun and people was friendly.
good,"Assembly:"
good,This business is going through challenging and changing times and this reflects in the changing team and individual staff member landscape inside Agco
good,"AGCO could be a very great place to work, but frequent management changes make it difficult to assess work environment and carry out goals and key objectives"
good,"Poor senior and upper level management. There doesn't seem to be focus and alignment and there is too much resistance to a changing environment. Lots of good people are there but unfortunately not enough of them are in positions of leadership. On the good side however, is they pay well and have excellent benefits."
good,"I was hard getting on out at agco.  you had to know someone, once on job was good.  they are not very family oriented like they state they are and moving up in the rank of things is hard again you have to know someone"
good,The work is not difficult if you are mechanically inclined. They supply tools to do the jobs that you are assigned. Fast paced environment . Can be extremely stressful at times.
good,Wroking non stop.I Learned about structure. Management so far good.The hardest part of the job i must carry heavy weight steel.I enjoy welding all day long.
good,"There was a lot of variety in what I did each day and I enjoyed my job an what I did an took pride in doing an excellent job . Advacement was way to political an not based on what one new or had to offer this company. As such it made for an extremly challenging day . Parts of management were supportive and parts were not. Right hand never seemed to know what the left was doing, each area was as extreme an diverse as black n white.. This place was so much more enjoyable 4 owners ago and is still under going change. Perhaps one day it will return to an enjoyable place over all an not area specific .."
good,"All about the numbers. A lot of red tape and politics, expected of a big company. Doesn't allow much time for life. Long unpredictable hours. Learned how to spray liquid and powder paint. No one has your back but yourself. The hardest part of the job is carrying everyone else."
good,"Awesome Benefits, but Management is so different than I am use to after 5 years in the military. Very unsupported of worker ideas, and very hard to get them to work as a team."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho, respeito as leis trabalhista, mas ainda com muita política entre os departamentos gerando retrabalhos e conflitos que acabam se tornando pessoal e assim ficando acima da corporação."
good,Good place to work. If your not going to do your part don't even apply for the job! They have good pay and good benefits!!  it is a hard part of the country to find a place to live but low cost of living!
good,"Pretty good company"
good,"Most people just do their jobs and go home. I learned a lot from this company and am grateful. However the work flow is miserable and the amount of work needed to off set the terrible computer system is tremendous. "
good,"Its a very great opportunity to work at this place, as it has diverse products which is an excellent platform for any individual to get hands on experience. In short time you will be introduced to various manufacturing applications and issues pertaining to production."
good,um serviço agitado tinha que ta sempre cuidando as peças o ambiente com os colegas era tranquilo o problema e quando ocorria manutençao da maquina que era gargalo podia atrasa a montagem.
good,"billing clients all day. It was okay, not a very good company to work for because it was going through transitions."
good,"When I joined AGCO in 2009, I was impressed by the involvement of the management in wellbeing of the employees.  My team was in Asia and All top management leaders travelled to Asia to visit AGCO operations and gave presentation to different departments"
good,"inspect first , using hand tools and power tools to build a tractor out frame, install battery, steering wheel, fenders, tighten with screws and bolts include in the tracor. fasten tractor to station 2 to install grill, 3 point links, subframe and tires, transfer to station 3 to install loaders, hydraulic hoses and tighten valves. finalized and check all bolts and components. certified licensed operating forklift to pick up loads or pallets to their designated areas or racks."

good,"° trabajo en equipo"
good,"opportunités de développement très efficace ( selon secteurs: lean manufacturing,  production et méthodes)"
good,bien mais bon voila il faut tomber dans le bon service
good,"I experienced it first-hand, but I was told many times during my tenure at AGCO that the Supply Chain Team usually goes through a complete and voluntary turn-over every 24 months.  This is sad that a company of this size doesn't realize the issue (management) and make changes."
good,"Empresa de alto nivel, mas sem perspectiva de evolução,nao fornece estabilidade."
good,"always looked forward to going to work and see what new challenges awaited. good group of team players,,,,always able to count on help when needed"

good,"Na área que atuei, na manutenção, a empresa tem uma variedade grande de equipamento (máquinas CNC's), o que agrega muito no conhecimento, por trabalhar com diversas máquinas diferentes, e ver a metodologia que cada fabricante usa em suas máquinas."
good,"Falta de cultura, e principalmente de valores esseciais, como vida particular das pessoas fora da empresa, falta de reconhecimento proficinal, na questão salarial, tinhamos tambem bons beneficios, como vale-alimentação, plano de saúde, a empresa tambem envestia muito na formação pessoal, de seus colaboradores."
good,tres professionnel et rigoureux jai pris beaucoup dexperience grace a eux
good,Overall Agco was a good company good benefits good pay they need a better attendance palace I was told I was in good standing with the attendance points system but I was fired a few days later for calling in when a snow storm hit and went into the ditch and was unable to go to Work

good,Gute Firma aber da Börsennotiertes Unternehmen sehr basiert auf Produktivität.
good,fast pace you can learn alot if you pay attention on how to assemble the tractors farm and residential it also helps if you know how to use tools.drill
good,Ok place to work. The culture varies by who your particular manager is. Purchasing is a little unstable but that is due to the the management in place.
good,"AGCO Finance war zu der Zeit in der ich dort angestellt war im Umbruch, jedoch war das Arbeitsklima sehr angenehm und ich habe als Werksstudentin bereits früh Verantwortung übertragen bekommen und konnte mich voll einbringen."
good,Some days it was a fun work environment otherdays it was stressful you know the job because they train you competitive pay and your able to transfer positions throughout plant

good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho;"
good,"foi uma experiencia muito agradável da parte das amizades, mais da parte administrativa e de liderança ainda falta algo a mais da parte deles, de ter mais reconhecimentos sobre os seus funcionários."
good,"The team dynamics plays a key role in whether or not you're successful. There was usually a lot of push towards end of month, quarter and end of year to make numbers with little regard for the work-life balance of the employees. "
good,"I learned a lot with AGCO. It allowed me to grow and develop into the person I am today. Staff was easy to work with . Very professional environment. Culture was top notch, able to climb the ladder as far as one wanted (within reason). "
good,"The job is good and the pay is competitive with the national average. I really would like them to provide Further skills training with school tuition for hourly employees. We work 8 hour days. I have been able to develop my skills with hands on training. "
good,Okay place to work.  Most people are very nice.  Some disconnect between upper management and bottom line workers.  Decent benefits.  Work-life balance could use improvement.
good,"Worked in team atmosphere with full integration of marketing, manufacturing, technical support, engineering, and new product design testing. Allowed to fully integrate with team to provide high levels of feedback."
good,If you like working half the year then this is your place. Very strict guide lines to follow. Lay offs all year round. Good pay and benefits. Good group of people to work with.
good,"Bonne cohésion d’équipe: activités de groupe fréquentes, team building…"
good,Overall good work environment but impacted by market conditions.  IT structure going through fast past modernization to bring regional resources into a global framework
good,"very hot physically demanding job, which made the days go by at a fast pace. i welded large frames and operated the large frame robots and small parts robots. the hardest part of the job was working in 120+ degrees through the summer months. i enjoyed welding the large frames more than anything because i could set my own pace and exceed my daily standard almost every day."
good,"Has alot of good people.  The product line are growing, and more "
good,"Agrega conhecimento aos colaboradores, forte atuação no ramo da agricultura"
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and my job duties. Everyday you learn something new either troubleshooting a problem or print changes. To me management was always changing and made it less and less comfortable to work in the workcenter.
good,"AGCO has given me the opportunity to grow and develop both personally and professionally.  I truly enjoy being part of a culture that embraces change."
good,"Long hours, a lot of communication and different environment within each separate building."
good,estou aprendendo muito com meus colegas. A parte mais agradável de trabalhar na agco é que  é uma empresa que te da muita autonomia nas atividades.
good,The only thing I did at this job was put together farm equipment. It's a fairly easy assembly line type of job.
good,Quality Product. Good team. Overall nice company to work for. The management team is a little out of touch with employees. Computer systems need an overhaul.
good,Retired - was a good job while I was working there. Wanted to work Part-time for a while.
good,Fast paced environment very well paying job. The schedule was great 3 shifts shop no union. Some people are not too friendly due to frustration with Management
good,Muito potencial para a empresa expandir e ganhar clientes com produtos de alta tecnologia.
good,"It was a decent job, collecting cardboard and compacting, sweeping up the warehouse. Receiving packaging. Pretty good working environment, slow paced. Constant."
good,As pessoas ae ajudam bastante a solucionar problemas do dia a dia.
good,"Iots of opportunity. Lots of incentives for safety, and good attendants.  Very clean,  , well organized work system. Very calm and positive environment. Meet lots of new people. Trainees are trained until they are comfortable enough to be on their own. After the 1st    3 months new employees are due for a follow up review, and a 2nd review after 6months."
good,Empresa com bons benefícios boas condições de trabalho
good,This is a good company to work for.  The pay is good.  The benefits were good.  On the whole the company promotes a cohesive work environment.  I felt safe and secure there even as a security guard.  They promote a learning environment.  It is most pleasant working environment.
good,"Aprendi muita coisa do setor de exportação de produtos e peças, o convívio com os colegas de trabalho era muito bom e a única dificuldade que todos possuíam era a de poder repassar a gerência o que acontecia na empresa."
good,"J'ai eu une expérience  a  AGCO  en décembre , j'ai aimé travailler la bas,une bonne entente avec les collégues de travail un bonne état d'esprit d'équipe , un travail intéressant des personnes qui on pris le temps de me former ."
good,"Great benefits and work/family balance.  "
good,If given the chance I wouldn't go back. They only cared about the dollar and not our health or family. I worked 12 hour days and there was never anything to show for it. Lack of teamwork and drive was very noticeable with the management. No one was ever happy to be there and believe me we tried.
good,"Minha rotina é um pouco turbulenta, talvez seja por conta da área, que costuma ser um pouco imprevisível quando surge algum problema. A área de transportes, sem acompanhamento, vira uma bagunça. Velocidade na informação faz toda a diferença e é necessário bom relacionamento com todas as áreas da empresa, pois o contato é constante. O acesso a direção é um pouco difícil, a maioria do tempo estão em reunião, mas quando há algum problema que necessite uma decisão gerencial, o envolvimento é rápido."
good,"Empresa com cultura muito forte, time da engenharia de alto padrão de qualidade. Pessoal muito receptivo, equipes de trabalho sincronizadas, trabalho era executado com dinamismo e competência."
good,Tive uma ótima experiência na AGCO. Tanto minha gerencia quando minha líder direta foram essenciais para meu crescimento.
good,"Building combines and tractors was a typical day at work. I learned assembly line systems and paint department.Co-workeers were fun to work with, the hardest part of the job was climbing on combines. The most enjoyable part of the day was working in a good work enviroment."
good,This is a collaborative work environment with many favorable attributes of a smaller organization.
good,"Exercia as funções com responsabilidade visando a prevenção de acidente, atendendo as necessidades da empresa.."
good,Good people and good work just be on time and stick to the rules and you’ll be fine. Don’t be late and definitely walk on nails for the first 90 days. I liked working there I just was in a rough spot in life at that time and had too much going on. I loved the people I worked with and the environment I worked in.
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, com bons benefícios."
good,Empresa líder de mercado que paga salários com média acima do mercado. Ambiente muito competitivo. Muitas disputas pelo pequeno poder. Funcionários muitas vezes agressivos e pouco colaborativos. Estagiários exigidos como funcionários efetivos. Alguns líderes são pouco acessíveis. Clima organizacional muito tenso as vezes. Muitas ações de segurança do trabalho.
good,"40 hour work weeks with flexible deadlines, small teams, and a close group environment. Not much growth for improvement, however fun and a happy workplace that help each other. Most people have been in their positions for several years."
good,It is a fast pacing job. People are good to work with. New management is poor. No communication between shifts some what people work as a team. You get moved alot. The shut down is the worst. 4- 6 weeks usually.  .
good,"If you want to be a part of change and improving processes, this is the place for you."
good,"Great place to work, with advancement opportunities. New management has made significant changes to the organization. Would work there again. Good culture."
good,Travail et entreprise très intéressante pour du travail intérimaire.
good,A typical day at Agco in the maintenance dept can be quite chalanging. It may include major machine repair or minor PM type roles. You have to learn to be self motivated and stay on task to support production activites.
good,I have had a lot of experience working with the new paint facillity they built.I have had much experience with Electro static liquid and powder paint.I have had alot of experience working with automatic overhead moving load bars.
good,com muito empenho é possível construir uma carreira
good,"Great co-workers and work environment, very active days with never-ending deadlines. Somewhat stressful but rewarding. Only complaint is that men are paid more than women for same work."
good,"Are improving about internal mobility"
good,"Durante meu período de estágio tive a oportunidade de aprender coisas novas, porém a gerência me deixava muito ocioso, o que me prejudicou profissionalmente."
good,Agco is a great place to work. There are several areas to work in and is a great place to learn new skills. The pay is good and most of the employees are great to work with. Management is hit and miss on people who actually care about you as a employee.
good,"I really liked working with different systems and meeting new people"
good,"Hesston, Ks. is a nice place to live and work.  AGCO has some great folks!  Enjoyed my time there."
good,"É bom de trabalhar , muito boa remuneração e benefícios, o único problema é a falta de estabilodade para com os funcionários."
good,"A empresa é muito boa, na verdade, foi muito bom trabalhar lá."
good,"O dia a dia na empresa sempre tem algo novo, claro que muitos pontos são repetitivos como reuniões, analise de segurança, produção e também o acompanhamento de melhorias setorial que já estão no nosso dia a dia. Mas sempre tem algo de novo que aprendemos, onde se tem pessoas se tem conhecimentos ocultos onde todos os dias você descobre coisas novas e assim fazendo com que a empresa tenha um grande potêncial de crescimento."
good,Good place to work.  Work day is usually 10+ hours and we work every fourth Saturday.
good,"Uma boa empresa com ótimos benefícios, funcionários acessíveis, investimentos sempre de ponta."
good,"A empresa possui uma excelente estrutura que proporciona ao profissional investir na sua formação pessoal ."
good,"Trabajo Técnico muy Interesante, Mucho contacto con Clientes y Trabajo en Campo. Se aprendió el mercado Agrícola del País. Falta de Ética Personal y/o Experiencia de los mandos intermedios, crearon una situación de tensión laboral. "
good,Possibilita desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional dos seus colaboradores.
good,A lot of interesting job tasks that challenge you at times. Placement of purchase orders after analyzing the inventory of global locations. Resolved many shipment problems due to supplier errors. Resolved also many receipt errors at our facilities in order to improve the payment of invoices in Accounts Payable. Expedited sales orders when necessary and worked closely with Customer Service in order to provide great service to our customers.
good,"Entreprise très agréable"
good,"Good place to work, good people. The wage is lower than market average.  Some sites are in rural place which can be hard for people with suburban life style."
good,I worked at AGCO as a Finance Intern for the summer. The experience was great and I learned a lot about my desired field. I really enjoyed the feedback that was given throughout the internship.
good,Multi Nacional com liderança de mercado. Sempre investindo em produtos e funcionários. Possibilidade de crescimento profissional. Excelente condição de trabalho
good,"Bom lugar para trabalhar, pessoas qualificadas e gestão com muitos pontos a melhorar."
good,"Trabalhei poucos meses então não tenho muito  para  falar,conheci pessoas maravilhosas que trabalham lá foi o que me deixou feliz nesses meses trabalhados."
good,Uma das melhores empreeas que ja trabalhei e trabalharia novamente com muito orgulho
good,"I was an intern at AGCO's Hesston site for two summers. The site had a mostly positive and productive vibe to it, but it was a bit crowded. There were specified tasks to which I was assigned as an intern, but after completion of those I ended up floating between departments a fair bit; given that I wasn't far along in my college education yet at the time, it was nice to be able to get a broad experience, but sometimes it felt a bit aimless."
good,"AGCO is a well lead company focused on the long term success of it's customers, employees, and shareholders.  Combination of a challenging work environment with reasonable expectations made for a positive work environment."
good,Beaucoup d'avantage pour les salariés. Cependant quelque soucis sur l'évolution de carrière.
good,"Empresa boa, bem estruturada e com bons benefícios. Só a questão da estabilidade que já foi melhor."
good,Good company. Good associated benefits package but salary levels low compared to market rates and competitors. Certain departments are much happier with their management structures than others.
good,"A rotina diária bem dinâmica, e envolve muito trabalho com o cliente (concessionários), visitas no campo, e internamente, exigindo uma boa relação interdepartamental,  muita pesquisa e planejamento.   A empresa tem uma diretriz muito forte no que se refere à participação de mercado e resultados,  e está no caminho certo."
good,Empresa que oferecia benefícios atrativos. Aprendi muito como profissional e pessoa. Gostava muito do meu trabalho e sempre procurei superar os desafios com muita responsabilidade. Ótimo relacionamento interpessoal com colegas.
good,Worked on Android Application development for remote machinery tracking on Google Maps.
good,Working at Agco has been challenging just as much as it has been rewarding. The company does an extremely good job at conveying on the job safety as the most important part of the workplace and its employees. It seems as though everyday we are faced with new challenges as well as changes that have been made to either improve work production or on the job safety.
good,From the shipping dep in warehouse to CSR to Materials Dpt
good,Great employees but very long hours required in order to succeed and be successful. Work/Life balance is very difficult.
good,"Allocation using SAP FBAN"
good,I liked how the jobs kept me busy. And never had to wait on parts that I needed for each job. Most of the people who work around me are very helpful when needed. I feel the prints were easy to interpret and read so parts are assembled correctly. Work areas were laid out for room to work in comfortably and tools were easily accessible. Overall it was
good,"Travail de journée agréable. "
good,Empresa ótima e com excelente cultura profissional.
good,C une société ou on fait confiance au personnel et un objectif commun perdurer la santé de l entreprise
good,"A stable place to work - Can be fast paced with a lot of emails"
good,Depending on the projects I'm involved in my day can vary. A typical day usually involves a few meetings with hours in between to get work completed. Some tasks require out of the box thinking to figure out how best to complete reports or presentations. I enjoy the reporting aspects of my position and the testing of new systems. The least enjoyable aspect is working with internal Field Reps as they are not always quick to respond. The office environment is generally calm and quiet. Although working in a cubicle while on meeting calls can be difficult when conversations are being carried on right next to you.
good,the shift managers did their best to take care of their people but the plant manager not only has no people skills but lacks common sense to speak of when it some to sett achievable goals without slave driving his employees
good,"Gostei da força em desafiar seus colaboradores nas suas atividades. Nada é simples e tudo muito dinâmico, desafiador."
good,Rewarding career but felt channeled in career path.  Overall management and workplace culture is a great. The hardest part was lack of communication of vision by mid level personal and balancing work/ life.
good,I love agco. They're absolutely a great place to work. If you like working with wood and building then thats the job you. Lots of easy to get along with people who work there and the managment is amazing

good,Bom ambiente de trabalho com profissionais eficazes.
good,"Great company to work for and have lots of opportunities."
good,"I really enjoy my job, I would like to be able to go forward though in this company there is no more moving up.  I'd like to be at a place of employment closer to home rather than 35 minutes away.  I work with a lot of customers-truck drivers, scheduling, ordering kits, answering phone calls, typing, computer data entry. We all work as a team which is a good combination.  Supervisor is a good supervisor in many ways."
good,"Account management for UK & Eire.  Building companies reputation via excellent customer services & problem solving.  Very Administrative based role.  Employees all work together as part of a team to create a friendly family feel to the company but results are recognised as far a field as the USA.  Small company with a large impact on turnover.   "
good,"Fare company but a typical company - do your job and it will all work out.  Excellent compensation plan and great people to work with."
good,I always got the support of my coworkers and manager to advance in my assignations therefore in a very short period of time a lot of good results were attained.
good,"Work prioritization and team satisfaction with my support."
good,Working with a production facility was a rewarding experience. Managing a full work load and interacting with other departments provided an overall understanding of goals.
good,AGCO Corporation is great place to work. Everyone from management to coworkers are pleasant and very helpful on a daily basis. Working there is a learning experience and I have learned many skills over the years. They are always hiring employees that will take them into the future and help them stay competitive.

good,"Great company to work for with many opportunities, upward mobility. They put emphasis on training, ample opportunity for product training."
good,Ambiente agradável porém competitivo. Aprendia a dar valor ao ser humano em primeiro lugar e cresci como homem e profissional abrangendo todas as áreas da empresa. Direção centrada nas suas responsabilidades e gerencia com excelência de profissionalismo. Colegas competentes e profissionais. Lidar com a falta de materias para abastecimento da produção. A parte mais agradável foi o convívio como colegas de trabalhos e parceiros profissionais.
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte uma multinacional do ramo de máquinas agrícolas, muito bom de se trabalhar nesta empresa pois tem ótimos planos e benefícios para funcionários e familiares, com salário e acima da média do mercado, boa estabilidade bom ambiente de trabalho e ótimo relacionamento entra os funcionários."

good,"AGCO is a large, complex, global company.  The intellectual and professional challenges are numerous.   The people there are a very diverse population including people from many countries and many professional backgrounds."
good,"bonne ambiance, très bonne écoute et apprentissage pour les nouveaux, très bonne expérience général."
good,"Good management, room for advancement, good pay and benefits, decent hours, 3rd shift a little taxing... Good job security just show up every day on time"
good,"AGCO is a great place to work with very good benefits. Day to day functions of this job are to assist dealer service technicians in resolving technical issues to get equipment back up and running. The travel can range from a couple days a year to a couple weeks but is never extensive, you get to go out and meet the dealers but are not a road warrior. This position will gain you in depth product knowledge and open the doors for future positions if desired."
good,Máquinas boas para trabalhar amizades limpeza organizacao
good,"Excelente no pacote de beneficios, salario dentro do que o mercado oferece."
good,Travail assez souvent pour adecco depuis pas mal de temps je suis très satisfait !
good,Empresa com otimos beneficios e mta interação entre os colegas fe trabalho
good,I enjoyed working here. During the busy times was the most fun. We stayed pretty busy. Management was pretty good and the Coworkers were very nice. Economical times have caused sales to come to a very slow pace. I will miss working with my coworkers.

I worked with reports on product tracking and KPI's  to ensure that the teams production goals. I also used a forklift to get support material,move product around, and to unload/ load trailers."
good,uma boa empresa para crescer profissionalmente e pessoalmente uma empresa de grande porte.
good,"A typical day at AGCO would involve either starting a new test for a engineer, continue a test already in progress, or finish the test report for the engineer to review. The hardest part of the job as to fix all the problems that came up during the test. Either a part that broke on a machine or problem solve why a certain system wasn't working properly. The reason I enjoyed this job was because it was a lot of hands on work, working on large agricultural machinery,and having something different to work on everyday."
good,"Plenty of inovative technical projects;"
good,Good environment for new comers and will have a lot of opportunity to learn.
good,I absolutely loved going to work here. Some days were tough but the personal rewards were great. Management never asked you to do anything they didn't believe you could do. Training is quite sparse in some areas however Agco in a whole does not want their employees to fail.

good,"Travail assez agréable, responsable sympa, qualité du travail."
good,AGCO has been a great job. It is a very large company so it's difficult to know everyone. My manager is okay. Most people here are extremely hard workers and it shows.

good,Ótimo ambiente de trabalho e que compartilha oportunidades para todos os funcionários.
good,"Em um mercado tão competitivo, com profissionais competentes e dedicados como o da odontologia, fazer parte de uma “Família” como a da AGCO foi um orgulho para mim. Claro que ajuda muito estarmos em uma empresa líder, que possui produtos de excelência e líderes de mercado, mas o que nos difere de outras empresas é o fator humano; são as pessoas que fazem transparecer o espírito de uma companhia, são elas que pensam e executam as soluções. Saí por crescimento profissional, mas valeu a pena ter trabalhado lá."

good,"AGCO is a great company to work for.  The upper management really do a good job of making everyone [who puts an effort in] to feel like they are contributing to the overall company.  Things are constantly changing, and you never have time to be bored. Many people stay there a long time, which is seldom heard of these days.  There is room to grow within the company; however, many people have been there so many years that if you are looking to move up the ladder, you might have to wait for someone else to try to advance."

good,"A typical day would start processing incoming ocean containers to produce tickets. Working as part of a team to unload containers via sit down fork lifts. I would match tickets to parts, then process parts to send to either warehousing or direct shipping. Agco taught me the most important parts of working in warehouses or factories are efficiency (speed and accuracy), and consistency in terms of following process and attendance. The hardest part of that job was making space when multiple containers arrived due to limited logistic flexibility. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing everyday functions as part of a team."

good,"Bem, na ACGO aprendi a me portar como profissional, não que em empregos anteriores eu não teria me portado, mas nesta empresa a cobrança era de tal grandiosidade que eu percebi o quanto eu podia melhorar em vários aspectos, a rotina começava logo bem cedo pela manhã as 7:30 horas e minutos, todos os dias, sempre foram dias muito agitados, desgastantes, mas muito satisfatório, por que eram sempre produtivos, no final do dia eu sabia que meu dever estava cumprido mais uma vez. Pessoas sempre dispostas a te ensinar e mostrar o caminho certo a trilhar dentro da empresa, sempre me destacava por ser pró ativo, e por trabalhar com sorriso no rosto sem se queixar de nada, apenas trabalhava em prol da empresa. Na AGCO eu aprendi que as empresas dão valor sim para seus funcionários, e o reconhecimento vem através do trabalho e do seu esforço, a parte mais difícil era quando algo dava errado, tínhamos que fazer o retrabalho para consertar a o erro, isso tomava muito tempo e isso acabava afetando a linha de produção diretamente, os dias bons era quando a produção estava em alta e tudo corria de acordo, e no final do dia inúmeros tratores saiam da linha de produção rodando. Um lugar muito bom de trabalhar pessoas educadas colegas de verdade, que não se omitiam a suas ordens ou pedidos, sempre ali pra somar a seu lado isso é muito dentro de uma empresa. Aprendi também a respeita todos e tudo, a encarar os problemas de frente sem medo de errar, a ter pulso firme, a trabalhar focado e com seriedade, mas sempre com o sorriso no rosto. aprendi que temos que gosta do que fazemos para fazermos"

A parte mais difícil é tu não gostar do que tu faz, e o agradável é chegar  no trabalho e ver a satisfação dos colegas, e eles ver à sua satisfação."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, me deu grandes oportunidades de aprendizagem, conhecimento de uma linha de produção e técnicos. Conheci grandes pessoas que além de colegas se tornaram amigos pessoais, sempre ajudando uns aos outros.

good,"If you don’t mind living and working at least an hour from pretty much everywhere and everything, and 2.5-3 hours from the nearest large city, Minneapolis. (Sioux Falls, SD — a smallish city with an apparent gambling addiction judging by the strip mall casinos and slot machines in every shop— is about 90 minutes away and offers a decent but limited selection of restaurants and shopping options), and school systems that do not rate highly, with a moderately high cost of living; and that you can tolerate occasional long walks through a very noisy and hot or cold open area wearing safety glasses and earplugs, Agco is a great place to work. The people are great, the pay is good, and you’re a part of building something real, and of very high quality. And that feels pretty good."
