rating,review
bad,"I am working here as contractor since last 6 months... Please dont work as contractor... They will say like we will hire you as regular employee after 6 months.. But they don't.. So don't trust, If you have better option please leave... Work culture is good.. Lots of learning..."
bad,There is no personal life balance. I work 13+ hour days and am exempt. Have worked every weekend 6+ hours on both days... still.  Asked for time off a month in advance for one day and told no because of yet another reporting crisis. Management is horrid. No control over deadlines. No idea of what it takes to do the jobs of employees. Am looking to get out ASAP. Always ask what happened to the people who did your job before you. These aren't new jobs. The jobs open are backfills for people fleeing..
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone  Management has much to be desired  They treat you like an entry level person and micro manage
bad,"100% turn over during my tenure. Management did not know how to operate systems and were not willing to learn. All training provided through co-workers. No accountability, all failures were blamed on staff. Expected to be tethered to your laptop or phone no matter what time of day, 80+ hour work weeks are not uncommon. Absolutely zero work / life balance."
bad,"on the direction  to stable the operation"
bad,"Only Indians and Israelis get fair promotions. Some hardworking employees with 7+ years of experience get stuck in their roles with no promotion, multiplied by being a female. . Even being a key team person with very long working hours and high achievements does not matter. This is where favoritism talks."
bad,My ratings says it all. Directors and managers are nothing but figure heads. Co-workers were nice.
bad,"Lots to know about the technologies used."
bad,"It is as you would expect at SanDisk.  SemiCon company that hires and lays off employees often.  Due to the nature of the industry, it is feast or famine.  The management of the company seems somewhat reactive/tactical rather than proactive/strategic."
bad,"learned much about sales from that job."
bad,"Poor upper management, internal politics, treat contractors and external employees showcasing same al the time. Good infrastructure and work culture.Network is good"
good,"Poor management."
good,Very centralized authority.  SanDisk acquired by WDC and the environment changed for the worse.  Senior management on the whole is quite poor - leadership lacks.
good,"many 14 hour days"
good,This company has the flaws of a big corporation.  Product development is slow and there is a never ending cycle of project cancellations.  You won't advance your career here.
good,"I have been working at Western Digital full-time. Learn a lot from the practical and challenge projects.The short-term product cycles created the organization, rewarding matrix and culture. Full of uncertainty, so it is hard to plan the long term."
good,"Lots of things to learn but not a welcoming company really,  Management lacks Emotional Intelligence , promotion based on click and and back grounds"
good,"It was a great experience to work with this company."
good,"For a fresher, sandisk is a great place to start as it doesnâ€™t pressurize anyone, the staff is supportive and lets everyone take time to learn about their products and plan out promotions."
good,Average work place. Workplace culture is ok. I learned new stuff. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendship you form at work. The workplace is changing since WDC took over. It is becoming big company culture.
good,"The company had a great culture but after being purchased we have seen signs of many impending changes for the worst. We had fun activities as a staff and now due to unity instead of adopting the lively camaraderie it is being removed altogether. The gym was the best feature of working here but even that is unknown state and is up for altering with a severely incomparable substitute. Growth opportunities are scarce and reserved for suck-ups i guess like most companies, your hard work will go unnoticed...."
good,SanDisk has made some management errors and has laid off some of the workforce. They also do not promote non-attorneys.
good,"Don't be tricked by the stock price."
good,"SanDisk is a very fast paced, fun place to work.  The downfall is if you are contracted thru West Valley Staffing, you're only allowed to work for 12 months before having to leave your job if you're not converted to a regular employee."
good,"The management is composed almost all Indian. This leads to company wise with Indian culture, that means low efficiency. Promotion and award is not fair."
good,"Daily builds are delivered and built up, Bi-weekly cycle counts. Orders are built upon demand."
good,"Very Dynamic work culture and fast paced."
good,"sandisk is world leading technology company in NAND flash business."
good,"Was an okay place to work. Diverse culture and fairly friendly outside meetings. During project meetings people tend to get emotional/defensive. A lot of misunderstanding tends to happen quite often, but that gets cleared up usually. Not sure how it is nowadays after the WDC aquisition."
good,"Very limited career opportunities.  "
good,Generally it was a good job. They have since been acquired by WD. Multiple acquisitions led to a conflicted culture. Management has some critical issues.
good,"Lots of political games played at the Dir/VP level that the mid level managers and IC's end up having to clean up. But generally pretty slow paced and calm if you can stay away from the politics. One very good thing about them is that it is a very high-integrity place -- no financial shenanigans, and they will take care of people on a personal level. At least that was true when they were independent -- not sure Western Digital can make those same claims"
good,"Busy with daily operations & activities. Everybody has their roles to play. All combined to make a great team. With all the buzz, we still have time to share & relate."
good,Troubleshoot drives and fix them soldering and or software issues. Learned a lot about flash memory and other product we have built as well as plenty of other qualities involved in this career field. Fun environment and outgoing people. Most enjoyable is the free lunch in the cafe with great chefs.
good,"1. Very good Work Environment"
good,"Good company to work for, you have to make sure you take care of your own direction, to move up. Great benefits, good people, fair management. Lots of organizational change in last few years."
good,"I find the work environment engaging and challenging. New ideas are welcomed and encouraged at all levels. On personal level, company arranges different kind of activities (outside work) for its employees."
good,People are friendly to work with. There are opportunities to learn from supervisor.
good,Great at onboarding personalities that get along very well. Contributed to a good culture.
good,"Good Place to work, Good leadership and great products, SanDisk, a Fortune 500 and S&P 500 company, is the world's largest dedicated provider of flash memory storage solutions. Our products enable you to capture, share, preserve, and enjoy a growing world of digital content. With removable memory cards in cameras, embedded memory in smartphones, powerful memory solutions in cloud storage data centers, and more, SanDisk powers your smart digital lifestyle."
good,"Work at SanDisk has been rewarding. The work atmosphere very trusting and I particularly enjoyed the team and my manager when I started working at SanDisk. I believe manager makes all the difference when it comes to employees being happy or not. Give trust, support and flexibility to your employees is some of the key success for a healthy team. "
good,Good place to learn about semiconductors. Excellent process documentation and well developed processess.  They empower employees to improve processes.
good,"No work-life balance."
good,"Overall good company! high work load, very competitive environment. The adaptation to new technologies were very fast. Company always worked to stay ahead in industry."
good,"+: Good work life balance, open sharing of information, helpful coworkers."
good,smp is genuinely a great place to work. The environment is very creative yet friendly and as a contractor it has been one of the most enjoyable placements.
good,The job was definitely not 8-5.....usually had to check emails from home with factories in Asia.....Overall management from CEO to lower levels treated the company as a startup rather than a multi-million dollar corporation.....immediate co-workers were a lot like family and worked very well together with them......the hardest part of the job were the hours......the most enjoyable part were the people.....
good,"There really is no such thing as a typical day at the office. The weeks are cyclical - some days are relatively low key while others have most people running full speed to meet major deadlines. I live for those days - the days where I'm running from marketing to operations to logistics in order to make sure the correct product and packaging shipped to the right account and destination. I've learned a ton in my career here ranging from recruiting and finance to sales, channel marketing and business development."
good,I assisted the VP of Human Resources and the HR staff.  Typical clerical  work day with occasional meeting attendance on behalf of the VP.  Culture at the time was not as diversified as I am sure it is today.  I enjoyed very much working which and assisting employee as a team player.
good,The IT Management was great.  It was fun but lay offs seem inevitably due to the prices if flash storage.  Margins are always tough in semi conductors.  When things are good you get well rewarded but things can turn quickly.
good,"fine company to work for, culture is, needs some work, recently acquired by WD, very little job security. Not very clear cut roles and responsibilities. Turnover is high."
good,"everything  must be done yesterday."
good,Startup Culture. Will improve on processes in coming years
good,Got good exposure on how they help enable solutions top in the stack. Good learning on how this layer of company products impact in the larger scheme of things and get a comprehensive picture on entire end to scenario.
good,In General Sandisk (now WD) is a good place to work. They have quality people and good work culture. Work life balance is good. But I felt that management lacks product vision in some key technology areas.
good,"Great place to work.. just no opportunity for advancement  More than likely, you will always stay in the same position.  The Pay is ok.. but often times there are cases of work requirement inflation."
good,"I spent many years at SanDisk, surviving many market downturns and direction changes. SanDisk grew into a powerhouse company acquiring company after company, trying to incorporate that into growth and vision for the future. Unfortunately, that growth and vision became more inconsistent and muddied with constant churn. While the workplace culture improved, morale would be decimated by flip-flopping managerial styles and quick turnover of managers and teams. Good people would be relegated to new managers, prompting good people to leave. And good managers would be given impossible tasks, prompting good managers to leave. Seems like the only way to stay afloat was to constantly shift roles to ride various waves of whatever was currently popular in management consulting courses."
good,There is so much flexibility with work/life balance that it makes it easy to come into work in the morning.It is also nice to have the ability to work from home if something comes up rather than have to take PTO
good,Very supportive management and good work culture. A lot of opportunity for  technical growth. A fun place to work and get to know  different cultures.
good,"I was a temp and am therefore not qualified to rank the company, but a direct employee would be. It was a very good place to work as a technical writer when I worked there."
good,Sandisk is a good company and nice place to work . I enjoy working at Sandisk. Benefits are excellent and Management is also really good. Its a fun company to work for .
good,"I worked here for more than an year and i learnt many technologies. Very flexible to work. I had great colleagues and very good environment. As a beginner, i really enjoyed learning and working here."
good,"SanDisk is now part of Western Digital.  My particular BU which was formed to market to Enterprise customers is really bad.  I am not really familiar with the rest of the Western Digital businesses or their culture."
good,"Great team to work with and lots of learning opportunities are presented. My voice really was able to be heard, and I was encouraged to take initiative."
good,Great workplace with a thriving corporate culture offers a lot of learning potential.  Friendly people and great place to learn.
good,"Good place to work in this company."
good,"Honest management, friendly coworker. Job is challenging and fun. Company pays good benefits for employees. Employees are encouraged to speak up new ideas, new inventions."
good,Off-ste management makes it a little difficult to get good direction
good,Intersting new ideas of testing and developing new products with different features
good,"It is a product based company and is an excellent place to work.This place has good work culture.It has good infrastructure and convenient transport facilities across the city."
good,It was a great place to work. Management was really great. Most of all the people I work with are so nice and fun to work with. They are really helpful and nice bunch of people to work with.
good,"Each week, take a moment to recognize the successes based on requirements, Engineering Spec, Product feature."
good,Job and life is balance and there is many activity.  Job is not so security.
good,The company sent their manufacturing to China and after 9/11 I receive layoff note. 
good,A day at the office would consist of support in a team of 200 engineers. The days would be long but a pleasure to work with all.
good,"its very good day for working in company "
good,"A giant corporation with all the usual trappings. They were generous with at least one severance package I know of. Not the most forward-looking company, especially for the Bay area."
good,muito boa experiencia para minha carreira profissional.
good,It was the new group that the company opened up to develop a product that it had been buying from the other vendors. The group initially was struggling with new product Qualification and procedure.
good,Recommended place to work with competitive salary and benefits. Fast paced and challenging however rewarding. Overall good management from top to bottom.
good,"Wonderful working environment."
good,It is a nice workplace. Love the people I work with. Everyone is very supportive. I couldn't have asked for a better place to be.  Not sure of how the new culture will be since we got acquire recently.
good,SanDisk has a very good product portfolio. People there are smart. The culture at SanDisk is very excellent. There is a potential for growth if we deliver great results.
good,"Overall, SanDisk a Western Digital company is a really good place to work as compensation and employee benefits are pretty good.  Work life balance for the most part can be attained while working there but there are times depending on management direction that you will need to work a lot of hours, especially at the close of a quarter.  The areas that the company could use some improvement on are diversity for African Americans and women, in addition to the need for there to be a clearer path for upward mobility in all positions."
good,"Sad that I was laid off, everyday was a busy day in my position.  I would love to have the opportunity to work for this company again."
good,"We were bought out 3 years ago, going from a start up to a corporation was a big transition."

good,"Best place to settle if you need a work life balance. Not an ideal place to grow. "
good,"SanDisk is a company focused on storage devices end to end. It is a nice place to work, I learned to manage projects and working in new markets, new technology."
good,"excellent"
good,Not a bad place to work.  Smart people and interesting work.  People were generally friendly and helpful. Management wasn't overly concerned about scheduling things at convenient times for people in different parts of the world.
good,Decent benefits and excellent coworkers.  Work life balance depends on your role (operations and Engineering Program Management are very demanding).  Management is ok but no clear path to go to next level in your career.
good,"It was an engineering and operation driven company. Most people are humble, nice and hardworking. The campus/HQ (~3K employee, estimate) is a good size. However culture has changed after the acquisition of Western Digital. Lots of people have left."
good,the SanDisk culture was very enjoyable in sense that you had free range on how to complete your task. For example usual each program are usually on 6 week time frame to finish without any kind setback or delays. Sandisk management was really good on helping us succeed on getting are projects done on time.
good,"Fruitless review as many the company has been purchased over 3 years ago, but it was a great company while before their purchase by Sandisk. Lots of great memories"
good,"Quick advancement to employees and training is always available. Great people to work alongside, a multi cultural environment.  The hardest part of the job was the hours."
good,A Great range of products to study and learn from .A wide range of products for every type of requirement and storage needs . A must work place to get a hands on experience in on the floor sales
good,Peers are helpful and got to learn a lot. As an intern I was treated like a full time employee which helped me gain valuable experience. If I have the opportunity then will love to work for the company again.
good,"Time is very flexible, lunch hours can either be used for lunch, walking around the campus, work out at the gym, or in a meeting with free food provided.  "

good,Worked really busy but happy. SanDisk likes to share information around employees. Everyday I could learn something new. Great job for someone who want to learn and growth.
good,"Due to dealing with conference calls in the middle of night, I had a flexible schedule.  Loved working out at lunch time and after work in their full gym,,,,a food court like you'd find at a mall but with great food.  The people that worked under me were great and we worked as a team.  My manager giving me leadership and open room to make things better.  It was nice while it lasted"

You get to know about various flash storage devices and the way its designed. And you have the opportunity to interact with firmware engineers behind the design of the world famous SSD's. I recommend Sandisk for all the aspiring candidates out there, don't think twice"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of helping out any of the engineers with testing hard drives, setting up equipment, and cleaning up the warehouse every day. I learned how to read code for specific programs and i learned how to organize and manage a vast quantity of product. my co-workers were really friendly and always taught me how to do things right. the hardest part of the job was becoming familiar with computers and organizing, and the most enjoyable part for me was being apart of a team."

good,This is the place you can learn many more things but regarding job security i would give negative marks.
good,"Having been only a contractor I cannot comment on benefits or other SanDisk related things."
good,"Coworker are friendly. Compensation is good. Some managers are good, some not so much. Work life balance is not always a priority. Social functions (e.g. ice cream social) now and then that is kinda fun."
