rating,review
bad,Part of the reason they're turn around rate was so bad was because management wasn't good and I rather fire someone then train them how to do something right. I kind of feel like if you want a good company you have to take the weakest link and make that the strongest link. You don't just fire somebody because they mess up that's not good management.
bad,"Don't waste your time. The hours are long. Too much is expected of you for the very low pay. Too much turnaround. People are quitting left and right. I've been with the company for 8 years and I've been promoted twice but there was no pay increase. I was told that it was a ""lateral promotion"" by the regional manager. It's time to move on for me."
bad,"Was paid minimum wage to do my job and my mangers job along with filling in help for all the movers along with CSR work and having to take training classes every week. harassment was and issue and why I left the company, their solution and punishment to those who perpetrated the  harassment was send them to training!"
bad,"Long hours. No work life balance. I work for this company for 7 years of my life, total wear and tear on body with terrible pay. Hard work all day every day and never appreciated."
bad,Horrible company no respect for there employees or there customers all they do is lie to people i have heard them make up so many lies to customers about orders
bad,"I gave close to 10 years of my professional career to this company and was disrespected, shamed, and bullied by the new COO. Anyone who thinks they could work in HR at Aaron's will find that the department is run by an impostor who has no background in HR. But he is a white guy, so he fits in with the management team at the company. All white guys. My advice is to move along and do not consider a corporate job at Aaron's. You will regret the politics and terrible way that corporate employees are treated unless you can break through the ivory tower that is sr. mgmt. They are a good ole boys club that are just milking the company for money. Its sad because Aaron's was once a great company."
bad,"Just avoid this place. It’s better to be homeless than work for this company. They make you feel like your crazy, you dedicate all of your time and no matter what you will never be good enough!"
bad,A place for those who likes to move furniture and sales. Will only recommend those who are in need of a job. There are plenty of hours to sustain a 40 hour work week.
bad,"This company rewards on results, not merits. You could be a great human being, that comes to work every day and bust their tails off. That doesn’t Matter because it’s all about the results. Work Harder, No excuses"
bad,"You  go into low income areas to take away Aron’s furniture, children’s beds, washing machines, dryers, refrigerator, etc. as the customers cannot make the high, price gouging payments Aron’s charges. Aron’s strongly pushes the poor into renting their merchandise knowing these people cannot possibly make the payments."
bad,This place has the worst working atmosphere I've ever seen.. I was a pt their and they made me feel like I was a peace of dirt.. I would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"Sucked. The guy helping me was rude and disrespectful. They lost the last e drivers cuz of him and to beat it all everyone seen it but the manager, he took up for him."
bad,This place sucks I don't recommend this place to anyone to work. This regional manager frank is a complete jerk and very racist. I'm glad I no longer works there
bad,This is not a job for someone who is seeking a long term career! No Benefits management dont back there  Employees! They switch an changes there Rules often. There is no room for  Advancement.
bad,The rules of the company would change to fit their situations which made the job performance difficult.  The pay was really bad for two weeks.  The mistrust look from customers.
bad,this position was one of the best position that i ever had. the front office had an open door standard out of this world.  i would reccommend any employee for this position.
bad,Not a good company to work for rhey try to let personal life interfere with work and it is just bad business they treat there customers poorly as weel
bad,unfair and hostel work environment under paid they wouldn't pervade any tool to work with  didn't properly up keep trucks really was disappointed with my experance
bad,"Corporate demands were unrealistic and senseless (i.e. taking time out to do self reflections on customer interactions). There was no fairness in weekend scheduling. I was expected to close (8:30) every Friday night, 6:30 on Saturday and work 3 Sundays out of the month. When I attempted to get assistance with moving furniture or appliances, the PTs rarely accommodated me with a good attitude. The GM spoke down to me, was hateful, very egotistical and was attempting gaslighting me. They love to write you up (i.e. had a Dr excuse for being absent and still got wrote up!)"
bad,"This location is terrible. I was offered a delivery driver position, when hired it was not what was offered. The product technition was 100% rude, objective yo character, and disrespectful to employees and customers. Management is over ruled, employees at this location run management,  they deal with bed bugs, they dont care if you are not comfortable with them, the employees are supposed to train you instead i was degraded about how i shpuldnt be an employee."
bad,"Micro management at its finest. You are only a number to them., they don’t care about you or your family. It USED to be family oriented until some of the bigger a holes came back. Very dirty politics behind scenes and in upper management/corporate."
bad,Aaron’s is the most awful place to work management is garbage an they always never want to give raises. Starting pay is awful an even if u do everything right still no lace to advance
bad,I will not advise anyone to work for Aaron's in starkville yea u can use a dolly for merchandise 300 plus lbs but wat about when you have to twist an turn to get it in the door Aaron's did me wrong in so many ways cant keep a GM or a driver take it from me
bad,Bad. Poor management. Lack of organizational structure. Favoritetism happened almost always with scheduling. It's a terrible place to work. I do not reccomend
bad,Fairway leading does not care about its employees. They do not care what happens a to their employees while being in the field either. The people you work with at the store will be like family but it’s chaos with organization. You are set up to fail from the start. If customers do not pay their bill they do not proceed to take them to court etc.. They charge them off the say it is you’re fault for letting that happen .
bad,My manager was a psycho. I am a 21 year old girl why am I out by myself knocking on people's doors past 8:30 at night not safe! The pay was okay it was every 2 weeks tho and only 11.50 and the hour are long. Also our office was infested with roaches.
bad,The pay is too low for the job asked of you. Management can’t do their own job and expect you to do it then get mad because you don’t do it. They expect way too much from one person and are always short staffed.
bad,poor management. Leadership is not strong point for the current manager he has not figured out how to be honest with guest and employees. Nepotism is alive and well.
bad,"Very stressful, pay is a joke and little room for advancement. Don't waste your time !!!!!  Most of the managers are friends and does not have the capability to manage others.They are very rude and disrespectful to the co-workers and the customers. The only persons that counts is their friends that they referred and hang out with."
bad,The favortism shown employees and outburst from Senior Manager is quiet disturbing.  I was told by Senior Manager that i did not sign up for this and i don't know what to do.  That is the type of leadership that was provided.
bad,"I worked here 5 years ago the start pay was 10hr, 5 years later the start pay is still 10 hr. You make over 400 calls a day, you are a bill collector."
bad,"This was a ok spot to work, I didn't like the hours and the pay. I was getting 10hr and work working from 8-9pm M - F, and sat from 8-1pm. There is very low, but the skills you generate are awesome."
bad,"This Aaron’s is a franchise. It is not part of the corporate stores. The management is very poor and they take advantage and pry on the underprivileged communities. You are forced to harass these customers at their homes and you are also forced to buy overpriced uniforms. $18 is the cost of one t-shirt and that is before shipping. The benefits are poor and the staff is quick to turn on you after asking so much of you. Working 12 hours daily with no time at home. Underpaid, cruel and overworked is how I would describe this company."
bad,Terrible company to work for. They promise you one thing and doesn’t see I️t through. Low pay. Supposed to get paid bonuses but we don’t. Management is TERRIBLE!
bad,"Treated like a dog and bullied like a child by the staff. The most hostile work environment I have ever worked in I do NOT recommend working here!!! I feel I was paid to be Cinderella while the 20 year olds sat around playing cards and mocking me.the more I tried to learn the more they rolled their eyes and cussed."
bad,the company leaves no time for a personal life also does gives raises with any promotion and arent willing to listen to any input from store level just not a great company
bad,Wouldn't recommend. Too many hours and little pay. Not managed properly. Always trying to rip customers off. At least that's how it was at the one i worked for
bad,"If you like being lied to, manipulated and thrown under the bus, this job is the perfect place."
bad,Work like dog you get no help in picking the juck the they sale to people. They make you drive your own car and then they don't want pay for all the miles you diver and they don't pay for gas. .25 cent a mile only. Really bad place to work don't get a job there please.
bad,"I don’t understand how they haven’t gone out of business yet. The manager has no idea what goes on in his store. The assistant manager is constantly doing something illegal. Way too stressful of a place to work with hardly any pay, no benefits, and terrible management."
bad,They do not work with you on hrs and they don't offer their managers the pay they deserve! Very long hrs some days 8 to 9 pm. If you don't hit your goals you get wrote up for it.
bad,"Once the company turned corporate everything changed, low pay for big expectations. Awful hours work open to close every day with no choice. Management is rude and disrespectful to customers and even more so to the workers. I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,After new management came in for the THIRD TIME in 2 in a half years of my employment the environment for me became super stressful always criticized and treated So poorly and that’s putting it lightly mostly by two people in particular everything I did was wrong even though I was there longer then everyone in the whole store when reported nothing was resolved I would never recommend working there I have worked in some not so great working environments but when it comes to that place it without question is the worst work environment I have ever been apart of
bad,Please don't work there To much work not enough pay I had to go over the district managers head twice to get a raise and it always feels like your job is in Jeopardy.
bad,"You are only a number to them, they treat their customers horrible  and their employees even worse. They are pretty much all corporate now, and they will always do it your job on the line. You WILL be working from open to close, and they don’t care if you have anything going on in life."
bad,"General manager has no idea what she is doing. Overall the company is terrible and does not care about the employees at all. They dont like giving raises, even after job reviews"
bad,the delivery drivers gets mistreated .they are the most hard working under paid people in the building . if u get hurt on the job ur fired.they barely wanna give u a raise .all the bonuses go to every in the office
bad,Aarons specializes in selling products to people who can't afford them. Aarons will violate collection laws in order to obtain a payment. If you enjoy treating people badly then Aarons is the place for you.
bad,Well I’ve been in warehouse and driving positions the majority of my working career and I can say Aarons is a very easy job just way to much drama the PTs fight with the ladies in the office because you will have 8 stops already and when your at your last stop and it’s about 7:45 they call you to come back to the store load a couple more stops and work until midnight! 9AM-11PM wasn’t okay i probably averaged about 65 hours a week! Not worth it!
bad,Management was a joke favoritism was definitely a thing working there the guys definitely gossip like  females at the end of the day it was every man for themselves
bad,Worst place to work at . Their open door policy is a lie. They pick and choose who they like and treat people who they don’t like like trash .. manger had wife working with him and him and regional manger was best friends so I couldn’t go and talk to anybody about how I feel are how my GM was talking to me . This is not a good place to work at all
bad,I asked for a raise. I was denied. They wanted me to drive and maintain the box truck. Deliver furniture up 3 floors. I moved a sofa up 15 floors. All 200-400 under the going pay rate against other moving companies.
bad,"Management couldn't cut it. There was so much turn around in employment you'd shake hi and bye all at the same time. Overall, when I was there, it was a horrible waste of time."
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work, but current management at my location is HORRIBLE! Tell you how they want something done one moment, then literally call you stupid the next for doing exactly what they said."
bad,"When I was hired as a manager in training, I expected to be cross trained to manage a store, The company ideology is bordering on the illegal. A  crude company promoting over aggression."
bad,"The GM was always looking to flirt instead of train. He would yell at me when i did something wrong even after i asked if it was ok. If you are a woman do not work here, you will feel like you are inferior."
bad,"I gave them years of my life for nothing, horrible people! Work life balance is non existent, pay is horrible for what is expected of you! I regret giving so much of my time to this awful company! Not to mention they want salaried employees to work 9-9 for the pay of 40 hours a week! Worst mistake of my life hands down!"
bad,"This place is horrid! I started here as a CAA and then I was promoted to Sales Manager with no pay increase. The people I was in charge of made more money than I did. I got pregnant after being here a year and I was still being required to move heavy furniture by myself. Horrible pay for the amount of work they required of you. There was also a management change and in the change the new GM brought someone else over to take my spot even though he said before he started that my position was good and I wouldn’t have to worry about it, then he tells me that he is cutting my hours and that’s when I knew I wasn’t going to have a job much longer if I didn’t go myself. I would be there from an hour before open til we closed and I never saw my husband or had time for myself. I’m so glad I decided to leave this awful company! I would highly suggest to never work for this company."
bad,"Management is trash, called stupid and sworn at in front of customers and staff. Your position will be threaded daily. No paid time off or vacation until one year after you’ve been with the company, no discounts or employee purchase option until 90 days after you’ve been with the company. Regional is a sexual predator, and HR did nothing about it. Management is working the “good ol’ buddy” system, so basically if your boss is your friend, your first up for promotion. I would never ever let anyone PAY ME to be mentally and emotionally abused by this company ever again."
bad,"I worked for aarons for over 4 years total now. Coming from a guy that spent time in the military, this company is a complete cluster. From the  top all the way to the bottom! I got promoted 4x from tenure here started out as a delivery driver and got promoted all the way to assistant manager. And this company still doesnt wanna come off any money. This company is full of spineless jellyfish who seem to only wanna pick on the little guy! It favors these terrible individuals they call ""customers"" and belittles your for doing your job to the best of your abilities to keep the raggedy customers happy! Only people getting paid with this company are the salaried personnel Do yourself a favor and run away for this company as fast as possible"
bad,"Aarons is a joke."
bad,"Don't waste your time !!!! Worst company ever , not worth the pay or stress you go through to get the job done. Not worth it at all I don't suggest at all."
bad,Boring just sitting there all day calling people who are more then 30 days which becomes beating a dead horse. Then if. You can't reach them on the phone cause they know the number you go to there homes during the day which they also at work so a waste of time. Pay rate is low and every 2 weeks hours are to long 8am-8pm most days of this all day
bad,"Be prepared to see greed and daily numbers to take precedence over the quality of the merchandise. Be prepared to be made to lie to cover the mistakes of management. I have never felt so subhuman in my life. Corporate does not care about the customers, most in store managers only care about the PNL. Lost a lot of myself there. Its heartbreaking to see people struggle so badly and be taken for an absolute run. If they did the math----they wouldnt choose aarons. so.... yeah. idk. its a very well crafted scam. Electronics especially.  bed bugs, fleas, feces, vomit, needles in sofas,.... BUT WAIT THERES MORE"
bad,This job will drain the life out of you you can be the best and be overlooked by management you blow the whistle and get black listed there is no fair path to being promoted you work long hours for below industry wages and held accountable for everyone else's numbers while juggling 3 jobs.
bad,"Terrible quality of life if you have a family.Job threatened if you didn't meet your goals,long hours,sometimes 15 hour days.Had to eork days off if your numbers were not in line."
bad,"I spent six years total with Aarons from Texas to Arizona. While the Texas location was much better than the Arizona location, the corporate structure is not set up to benefit the employee in any way. The attempt to modernize the company comes at the employees cost by way of reduced hours for pay, and unrealistic expectations set forth by people who have never worked at a store level."
bad,"My position was eliminated.  Traveled a lot, Got to meet a lot of interesting people, was afforded a lot of different experiences, was able to see a lot of the US."
bad,"It's a trap. They'll promise bonuses, and advancement but you will get nothing in return. No matter how much you do you never get the commission bonus."
bad,"Aaron's puts the ""cult"" in ""culture"""
bad,"Aaron's is sneaky and underhanded company that disrespects their workers and internalizes everything they do including their employees mental and physical health. Don't work for them, ever."
bad,"Worked for the company for 17 years I loved and felt appreciated from the Dallas location who I worked for 12 years and then I asked for a transfer to South Texas(Valley). I had a great regional at first,another Regional came through. That's when I was demoralized put down as an employee many negative things where told to me. I put a complaint to HR and it got worse. Retaliation against me began ,until I was let go because I got seek. The retaliation got so bad that I'm on a not rehiring status."
bad,"This is not the company to work for if you wanted personal time or flexible hours or even a family life. After working here for 5 yrs and seeing that the company is now open on Sundays just for revenue and shareholder profits is beyond ridiculous. Every week there is a new special of $1.00, $5.00 down for customers you either refuses to pay you or run off with the merchandise. You have spend three nights a week (mandatory) working until 9.00 P.M. to clear up these bad accounts. "
bad,Managers  disrespect you and nothing gets done when you inform some managers even go high on drugs awful place never again never work in a place so unprofesional
bad,Expect you to hit sales goals that are not realistic at the same time you take payments and stock the showroom by yourself. If you do not hit your expectations they threaten to fire you every day
bad,I hated working for this franchise was a good ole boy setting. There is no way to advance unless your a white male. This place is not a good environment
bad,money expect way too much say they are family business now open sundays 7 days a week work 10 to 7 pm no time with the family but beleave the big shots are off
bad,It's a great place to purchase somthing when you cant put all the cash up front for it. Has a great selection to choose from. Usually has a good staff to deal with
bad,"Stay focus on your goals and you will make in this industry, people are always looking to rent stuff instead of out right purchasing things. having said that go for it, it's your future."
bad,"This company goes through multiple managers a year, no structure, hours are horrible the managers expects the employees to work from 8am -9 pm but only works till around 5 pm no leadership store is dirty, furniture goes out without being cleaned and sanitized, rodant problem an they expect us to work in those conditions, overall horrible company"
bad,"As a customers account manager, I was second in command of the store. In the absence of the General Manger, I would over see all operations. The Hornell Aarons had a high turnover rate and struggled with securing a regional manager who played by the rules."
bad,The place is always short handled because the pay is not worth the amount of things that are required of the positions. In my time we have had 4 manager changed and about 7 people quit it’s stressful and not worth the time or pay.
bad,"Terrible place to work, terrible management in store and higher up. Pay is awful, days long just not a good place to work. They really could care less about their employees"
bad,This is the worst place to work!!! They only promote white people that don't perform. If you are minority and working hard you will not get promoted!!!!!
bad,This place is a joke i don't recommend anyone to work here they work yoy like a dog you have no time with your family they want all of your time if you here say good bye to a social life its draining and stressful
bad,"they do not care about the employees."
bad,"This store does not have any leadership or managers that know what they are doing. Since they treat their employees so terrible, no one stays so no one is trained well enough to lead. they do not pay well, or fairly. this company pays males more than females and rarely gives raises. super unorganized, and expect way too much of employees that they treat so poorly."
bad,"I hated working there, its very cut throat and inconsistent, the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing, management changes thieir mind all the time and cant decide how they want you to do your job or if they want you to."
bad,"Depending on your dept you will have to be in between 5:00 and 7:30am you will be expected to help unload trucks with material floor loaded, with a skeleton crew because they cant keep people in there due to the horrible management. No matter what they hire you for you will be lumping trucks they tell you anything because they desperately need bodies in there.The only enjoyable part was lunch break."
bad,They don't care about you don't work for them. Please don't waste your time and energy they don't care about you they will just use you and fire you we it the for a rise
bad,Lack of leadership and direction Poor management skills Unfair and unrealistic goals Same day delivery was not plausible Extremely high interest rate Resell product that should have been thrown away
bad,The pay is ridiculous and the people you deal with are bottom feeders mostly. They care nothing of their employees and the managers are the only one who make and money and they are entrenched and will never move unless fired. You are demeaned on a daily basis and it is a horrible place to work in general. They will lie to you any way they can to get you to work there.
bad,Communication was horrible and when I was said I was going to get paid more that never happened and when I had family come surprise me manager said I had to be at work no matter what and for me family is the most important
bad,I worked with 2 other guys and they were friends and we get paid by when we go out and they always left me to go by their self and they would be the pay for that day
bad,DM/RM don't care about employees poor benefits rude customers and fellow employees and back stabbing co workers try to tear others down just not to succeed
bad,The worst company that I ever worked for in my life. They did not not care about their employee's.They did several unethical practices.  They did not follow company policies.
bad,"Dying company, no future. Difficult/incompetent Store Manager, is only nice when district manager is in town. Treats employees and customers like garbage. Franchise store therefor they are above the labour rules/laws. Sales and Account Managers are doing delivery, cleaning most of the time. They have already closed down one of the stores."
bad,"I have over 10 years of debt collection experience.  This is the only organization that I am aware of that requires employees to knock on doors after 8:00 pm.  Negative interactions with customers will occur on a daily basis at this organization.  Furthermore, management constantly makes promises to employees to keep them producing but never follows through on commitments."
bad,This was one of the worst most sexist companies i have ever worked for. As a sales manager and key holder i was actually paid $2 less then my male delivery driver and told on multiple occasions this was due to the manager that hired me on and couldn't be changed. i worked from 8 am to 7 pm 6 days a week and practically ran the store as our store manager was never there unless corporate was. i was also passed over for less experienced or even outside hire store managers simply because they were men several times.
bad,This company is a joke the management staff only cares about numbers. Far as being a delivery driver it was ok except for the fact that the store I was at only had 2 drivers and they separated us in 2 trucks to deliver refrigerators and large electric reclining sectional couches by our selves so delivery took twice as long and ment you were working late it was normal to work 12-14hrs and if you worked till 10 or 11 at night and had to be back at 8 the next morning you better be there on time no excuses about the night before. So my suggestion would be run as fast as you possibly can and don't turn and look back ever.
bad,You learn as you go it's very fast paced you have to be able to catch on quick. Lots of information to remember about different accounts. If you work in one department's you still need to know a few things in other departments. You job is versital not just one thing or in one area. The life work balance is extremely difficult.
bad,I'm not allowed to disclose any personal or work environment activities to any other parties out side of involvement. I personally would not involve my self back into that position.
bad,They were not very professional. They yelled a lot and picked on certain workers. I can’t believe how unprofessional this place was. I wouldn’t recommend anyone working here
bad,Typical day includes calling customers to try and get payments from them. I learned that most people don't like getting phone calls at 7am on a Saturday. Management stunk.
bad,No feedback to provide- Just an overall horrible place to work. I would be lying if I said it was an ok place but there was nothing ok about it. They promote who they want and everyone else is looked down on
bad,"Do not work here especially at C1112 store (Murrells Inlet, SC) very unprofessional and very ""racist"" please stay away it wasn't fun at all. They don't care if you have a family you work from morning to night"
bad,If your a hard worker get ready to do everything by yourself and everyone watch you work. They constantly loose great employees but the awful ones stay.
bad,"Employees lower than General Manager are treated as expendable. Most recently, the wages and hours were cut for everyone below GM. They tried to call it a raise, but when you make less than you were, it's hard to define that as a raise."
bad,i was a top salesman at aarons i really tried to turn it around but everyone there was on drugs and wanted to keep it that way then make a better store
bad,"Started off as an easy going, but stern company and staff. The management is poor, There wasn't any trust, loyalty, compassion, or respect given from management to staff and vice versa"
bad,Fired with no reason! Management sucked! General manager and regional manager were best friends so they did whatever each other told! Wrongful termination! Worked 12+ hours a day so the general manager could do as he pleased. Worked every saturday open until close! You cannot have a family or persona life working in this cursed place of business!
bad,Harassed by customers on a daily basis. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company. This is the reason why I am actively seeking employment.
bad,"Terrible insurance rates, some of the worst management I have ever seen, and long hours for far less than what you should be paid. At one point I was working 60 hour weeks and making $9/hr. In my years there I only received .40 in raises, and was berated and verbally assaulted by management to the point that other employees and I drafted a formal complaint to the regional manager; which was promptly ignored. I can not recommend staying away from this job enough."
bad,"I put in all my time and effort into the company without complaining, even lost a lot of family time for this place and still got treated like i am just a number. They don't treat their employees right at all."
bad,"Poor management, store, and regional. Expect to have no family time. Expect to move alot of furniture, encounter bed buds, roaches, etc.., This was one of the worst places I have ever worked."
bad,This job sucks! You would always have to be brown nosing someone's butt to go anywhere and if you didn't they would treat you bad! Too much gossip! The general manager was horrible! He gad a favorite and would expect her to run over everyone! Bottom line! It sucks!!
bad,Sales sucks. Begging people to purchase over priced items. People end up paying triple what the furniture actually costs. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,I would never work for this place again. Management was terrible. HR wouldnt do anything to help. Was harassed almost the whole time i was employed. Pay is terrible.. and the work schedule changed every day
bad,Nothing really to say about them you have to live eat and breath this company if you wanna last  deal with infestation homes horrible costumers and just a over all  not a fun place to work
bad,You don't get paid for the work you do even the managers only make $10 per hour starting out and there are no raises with promotions all in all don't work here not worth the time i made the same at citi trends
bad,"Upper management sucks. U might get a raise once a year or whenever they wanna give u one. It will probably only be .25 max. The customers suck, employees lie and steal. This place is a sh** hole"
bad,Run all you do is move roaches and bed bugs from one house to another and the customers are the sorriest people thinking you are their movers. Run from this place!
bad,manager didnt care about employees or customers for that matter. the pay was not good and you don't get benefits for being full time. hours were not good..
bad,was fired over telling employee to do their job because i quote its easier to fire you over a false allegation than to deal with the naacp plus they have bedbugs
bad,Never work here. Hours worked dont relate effort put in. they don't pay enough for the work done. Management is terrible. unorganized and lack of insight.
bad,The mannagment skills are terrible and the manager and all about him making a quick buck nomatter what it take and he is never actually their in the store.
bad,The hours sucks. The managers sucks as well. The company doesn't care about their employers. you have no time for your family! I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here
bad,My store manager did not care about you or your family. He only cared about the stores profit and what his bonus would be each month. I would highly recommend no one ever work with this company.
bad,"From the time you clock in the working day is total chaos. This is because of the lack of communication and management in the store. One person is sent out to do a two man delivery job. If you have to work late, on the last day that time goes in you are required to take a long lunch break so that you still have to work until close. I would never recommend working for this company. Wages are far too low for the amount of work and stress that is required."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone. The management is impossible to deal with and you have to beg for any time off or have a family emergency. You'll work 12 hour days and they'll try to make you work 15 for slave wages. don't work here
bad,"Managers are lazy, money hungry troglodytes. Everybody there wants to be the boss, its a terrible place to buy from, as far as being expensive. They have roaches and eggs of roaches living on the mattresses, and couches in the warehouse. There are roaches even on the showroom floor, and they even crawl under other peoples property. The managers will talk about giving respect but talk down to you and expect you not to speak up for yourself. As a PT you are blamed for everything no matter if its your fault or not!!! The managers send you also to do a two person delivery alone, making it very difficult to get the job done. Overall I recommend no one to work here or buy from here because in the end your not getting a deal!!!"
bad,"Aaron's has too much of a turn over. Employees are not treated like they should be, especially by the manager at the Cambridge store. This company makes promises and they tell you that your job is secure when in fact, it is not. The manager does whatever he/she wants to do without any punishment or consequences. Employees are not heard when they have a concern or a problem and they're often yelled at for things that were not under their control or for things that someone else did. This company should really investigate what kind of people they have working for them."
bad,"Working in the accounts department was very stressful at times, you are required to go to very bad parts of town and knock on customers doors to collect payment. on many occasions I have been threatened by customers while being at their house."
bad,worked very long hours for low pay and you are promised alot of incentive and money. Problem is you never actually get these things and when u ask an excuse is always given
bad,"Aarons was a soul sucking environment, the pay was terrible. Definitely not 30k per year. They try to tell you there are bonuses that help get you to that salary but the bonuses are so ridiculously hard get because of what you have to do that its not even kind of worth making the attempt. I was a sales manager and had no say in anything. They say its your floor, set it up the way you feel it should be but immediately stop you. I spent more time doing maintenance and service calls than i did selling. I wouldnt recommend Aarons to even my worst enemy."
bad,"Long, stressful and sometimes wouldn't allow a lunch break. They made promises in interview that never came to pass. Long, stressful and sometimes wouldn't allow a lunch break"
bad,"open store set up delivery for staff "
bad,"Supervise customer accounts and deliveries, making and receiving sales calls, product merchandising, scheduling, payroll, inventory specialists, and contract closings. Designed electronic file systems and maintained electronic and paper files."
bad,Absolutely not the place to work if you have any sort of morals and integrity. Dont plan on having a life outside of work. And expect broken promises.
bad,The general managers are snakes. The sales managers are lazy. The customer service rep's are lazy. The customer accounts managers are lazy. The customer account advisors are lazy. The product technicians get are the hardest workers in the store. The product technicians often find themselves doing the other associates job and the general managers do nothing about it. A lot of favoritism goes on in these stores.The best thing I did was leave this company and I will never go back or recommend anyone to work here. The pay is extremely low for the ammount of work the product technicians have to do. The minimum should be $15 an hour but they pay $10. Such an insult for the kind of work you have to do here.
bad,"The owner is horribly cheap does minimum to keep up the company, does not belive in home life expects u make work all u got. Tries to micro manage everything and is very lazy!"
bad,"Overworked and under paid. You have little to no time to spend with family. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upper level management. They sometimes make you feel no matter how much you do, it's never enough. Even though they were not interested in paying more. If you are single and love being stressed out all day everyday then this is the job for you. If not stay away from this company!"
bad,"Aaron's I thought was a good company to work for, and it was initially. I got a new regional manager that didn't have a clue about the business. After the arrival of the new regional that's when the situation got chaotic. I'm just glad that the nightmare is over and I don't have to deal with that environment anymore. I was forced to work 90 days straight without a day off because we were short staffed. I never got any help from upper management as far as relieving me and giving me a day off. The pay should be more for all that you'll go through. The upper management doesn't seem to understand that you can't make customers pay you. I can't count the times customers pulled guns on us."
bad,The job was not great at all. Company does not offer great benefits. Company pay is poor and no room for growth. The only pro for this company is the discount that you're able to get off furniture.
bad,This place is by far the worst place to work i use to be a delivery driver they want you to set up a bunch of stuff while trying to maintain a fast paste they put so muvh deliveries on and the pay is sucks for allllll the work you have to do for a delivery driver freaking 10 bucks an hours to move furniture all day going up stair and doing everyone else jobi would never go back to this job even if it was my last resort rather be a bum then go back hours suck to top it all of never home with your famliy and split days off and i got injured on the job and still expect you to come in and work never appricate your employees
bad,This was a very disappointing company.  They do not appreciate employees and are not employee oriented.  They display very poor moral and ethical business practices.
bad,This company is the worst that way everyone is treated by management is diabolical. The engineers are stressed because of the work that is thrown at them. Supervisors that sit on there back sides  all day and just pass the buck to team leaders and don't do anything apart from telling office staff to dump all work on engineers. Moral is at an all time low and prospects are useless unless your a friend of management. Do not work for these morons as money and work is trash.
bad,"Managers treat you like you are a dog at times, you are always working past your scheduled hours if it's pleasing them. They show no respect, very rude to their employers and customers."
bad,The work is great just they change the policy all the time and expect you to know the new policy without telling you it has been changed.  Nothing is ever set in stone.
bad,Very demanding job and pay is not adequate. I literally hated every moment of working here. The managers and supervisors are very rude and disrespectful.
bad,good luck if you except a position with this company. I have watched countless prospects come and go the current environment isn't for the faint of heart. Expect long hours and if your in sales you have to be able jump around like a lunatic just to get the job finished during the day.
bad,"would not recommend this place to anyone a horrible place to work , you work long hours. Not worth the pay or the work. Only benefit is the discount on furniture!"
bad,"harassment,texting driving, workers selling drugs out of the company truck all allowed. reported these things and apparently ""I was stirring up Sh**."""
bad,I'm being complete honest... for future employees...honestly the worst place I have worked at.... the staff is short and people do not help each other around there... the new sales manager was a complete ****8 ... he was a 10 year marine vet who was young but still on my *** every single second when I didn't have deliveries and there is only so much you can move in a furniture store or clean stuff.. another thing is the store closes at 7 but you don't leave until its done.. so basically you never know when your getting off.. another thing that sucks is going to random peoples house with different smells and dogs ..
bad,"This company will work you as a slave."
bad,"Aarons is a sun up , sun down place of employment. I personally feel like they target people on fixed income and over charge for their merchandise. If only making money and not caring for others is your goals, this is the place for you"
bad,"You are better off working for McDonald's or Burger King then this place. Horrible company, horrible culture. They put their employees at risk everyday. Including but not limited too: Going in to houses INFESTED with Bed Bugs, Fleas, Roaches, etc. and still take the merchandise back even when it is a complete loss to bugs. They pay their employees little to no money to work 12-13 hour days. The benefits are too much to pay for when you are making nothing. They ask to much of their employees with no incentive to do so. Horrible company, even worse management."
bad,The store I worked at there was a lot of favoritism and they worked you like a dog. Been in the truck from 8 am to 9 pm driving all day the same route multiple times to collect money.
bad,"Worst company to work. Not professional at all"
bad,"I will request to work in this company and gave me the opportunity to work on it. The regional manager sent me the offer and he talked about $ 40,000 a year and when I went coming to the interview only offered me $ 10 per hour. The situation is that if you apply for a Manager Trainee or other position in a franchise, the manager of the store does not have good communication and not understand nothing about the laws of HR and administration."
bad,Poorly run store. Lot of waiting around waiting for others to do their work So you can start yours. You will be made to deliver dirty washers and dryers as well as untested. Management tries to get you to lie to customers. You don't get 15 minute breaks. When you try to take them you get dirty looks. You can get fired for sitting on a couch on your lunch break. Store was infested with fleas for 3+ weeks.Co workers are great..just not management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the incompetence while in the store. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting out of the store and going to different towns every day. I would not recommend this job to anyone. It's not worth the headache. I'm sure other Aaron's stores are run better but this is the worst one.
bad,Do not work for this company. First of all they told me i had the  job and were gonna process my paperwork through. I called a few days later and they said my background check was still in the process of being sent through. I call a few days later and some lady picks up and says shell give me a call and let me know what was going on. She never called back.  I called today after waiting an entire week only for them to tell me the positions been filled. They said they were gonna call me and let me know. They were never gonna call. They had no intentions. If you ask me theyre a bunch of liars and would rather let you sit and wait than telling you they dont want you to your face
bad,"I left a good job to come and work for aarons. Mainly because I thought it would be a better opportunity. This however I was wrong.  I made it through my first week then my second week at my training store. That is one good thing about aarons however their training program is top notch, and the people they match you up with are all really good at answering any questions that may arise. Anyway as I said after my second week, I show up that monday more and am fired I am not given a reason nor was tgere any provocation to this firing. I understand this is a right to work state however. Seeing as how they now have my same postion posted on here demnading experience ontop of school I can only assume it was because I did not have the college experience. Anyone who chooses thia company be warned that they can and will hire and fire you just because."
bad,"Worst job ever, District Managers are worthless, act like they know whats going on but don't have a clue, said I wasn't doing enough even though i worked 13 hour day constantly. Said I was reason store wasn't growing but haven't gained a customer since I left. Zero life and work balance. 8am-9pm. Upper management acts like they on your side but they're not. Not worth the stress, and who really wants to deal with roaches and bed bugs. Returned merchandise dirty and disgusting."
bad,"This place is just for you. A typical day as a delivery driver has you zig zagging all over the city, back & forth, wasting tons of time because they don't know how to schedule deliveries. In addition to trying to shove their over priced, over sized sofas & refrigerators thru front doors that clearly aren't designed for furniture of this size, once you are ""lucky"" enough to maybe get it in, it always has to go up several flights of stairs. This is physically draining work which you are paid a whopping $11/hr for. In addition to the low pay, no bonuses as they promise & 1 hour daily deductions for lunch, even though you don't get them as a big city driver, there are no opportunities for major salary increases & the insurance is an absolute fortune. Almost forgot, you have to buy the required uniforms as they don't furnish them. That alone tells you what the company thinks of its hourly store associates. Not very much obviously."
bad,the place was bad management was horrible the work environment was bad the customers were the worst  mainly no help in moving heavy pieces.
bad,Family owned and operated. They hire you to do the  small dead end jobs. Don't promote you. Fire you when they are done with you for whatever reason they can come up with. Also the higher positions are held by family members who have no need to be working their in the first place.
bad,"Too much work and hours for low pay, no pay increase with promotion, and constantly on the phone with delinquent customers. There is no money in this industry."
bad,"Unless you want to be paid less than minimum wage and verbally degraded don't work here"
bad,"This company does not care about it's employees, there is some other sucker they will hire to take your place.  Long hours with no set days off, and in this position you'll have to be dying in the hospital to get a Saturday off.  They say they want to help the customer own it, but in reality they sell them borderline thrift store products.  The products are cheaply made and resold if its repossessed even if it's infested with bugs.  They sell customers new items but deliver used product.  Upper management doesn't care much as long as they get paid their bonus they could care less.  Pay is not equal to the amount of work done. You might have s managers title but you are not allowed to act like one.  Just stay away and never lease from this company you'll pay 3-4 times what it's worth."
bad,"Long hours, little pay. Yelled at by customers all the time even though they don't pay, hard to move up unless you are friends of a friends that is already a higher up. Late nights and in a truck all day with no radio."
bad,"Long hours, bad compensation.  I was a GM for 7.5 years.  70+ hours/week.  Leaves you with no personal life.  Do not work here!"
bad,"I do not want to give  a review as this company is not a good place to work for, unfortunately would not recommend to anyone."
bad,The upper management were very sexist. We were informed that if we were to hire a woman that she needed to be attractive so that customers would want to spend money. We were also expected to work through our unpaid lunch breaks if a customer came in.
bad,"There is no work life balance "
bad,Everything about this place sucked. The store manager and customer accounts manager were unprofessional and rude. It is my belief that they were stealing merchandise and money from the company. They made promises to people to get them to accept the job offer but then they would not follow through with the promises. With me I was promised $13.00/ hr but I didn't find out until after my first check that they decided to pay me $10.00/ hr. This after I had rejected a $13.00/ hr job to take this one. I was informed that I could take it or leave it. After 1 month I Ieft it. I would never recommend that anyone work here or shop here!
bad,I learned a great deal about sales and marketing. I greet every customer with a positive attitude and offered refreshments. Most of my customers were my favorite part of my day. The floor was kept clean and ready to show our customers our merchandise. Sales Manager was great partner to work with and was patient on teaching me my role in the job while we were short staff. General Manager was hardly in the store my entire employment and would discourage the entire staff for not doing well enough. Management was behind from previous employers. Owners discouraged me the first time meeting me. I was not recognized for any improvement and assistance I had made during my employment. I was not respected.
bad,doing this again. I did not like the job then and do not like it now so stop asking me about this job when I have already filled out this information for the third time.
bad,great place to start a work career. management at the time was great. typical day is unloading freight and also staging new displays on the showroom floor.
bad,This job is the worst place to work. Especially if you are a product technician. Management is comparable to high school teens. Everyone talks behind everyone's back and on a typical day everyone's just sitting on butts talking to the people they've been stabbing in the back on a daily basis. It's a buddy system everyone breaks the rules of the company to get friends hired and family members discounts. SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSEL AND SKIP THIS JOB BY ANY MEANS
bad,"Worst company to work for, job doesn't pay enough for the tasks they ask for employees.  No room for advancement inside the company and they have very shady business practices"
bad,I absolutely love working in sales. There is something so satisfying about selling and having a happy customer. Even if the customer comes in unhappy my goal is to make them happy by the time they leave.
bad,"This company is great about touting a competitive bonus structure, but the bonuses are not clearly explained to any new associates. The bonuses for the accounts team are nigh on impossible to reach without being a complete tyrant to all of your customers. Turnover is extremely high due to the low rate of pay, the massive amount of hours, and the unreasonable level of accountability that is placed on the general manager and other staff accordingly. The focus from upper management oscillates daily from gaining new customers to worrying about accounts and revenue, but in the same breath the email inbox gets filled with 5-10 items a day having to do with compliance of one kind or another. Add this to the pick-and-choose policy system that only seems to be in place when a manager needs a reason to fire someone, along with some of the worst and most abundant communication I have ever encountered, and you have a pretty good idea of what it is like to work for this company. Please, strongly consider the above and talk to someone who has been with this company for some time before accepting any position, regardless of their salary offer or bonus structure."
bad,"Well Dont let the Manager Trainee position fool you your nothing but a bill collector, your day starts out by calling the past due accounts not only their home phone but calling their work and references until you get a live person on the line, then you go out and repo nasty furniture that has bedbugs and critters yet to be named, If you enjoy being cussed out most of the day and worrying about bringing home bedbugs into your home then this jobs for you, also kiss your family life goodbye, because you will not see them until Sunday because the store is closed, ANOTHER THING YOU HAVE TO BUY YOUR OWN SHIRTS WHICH COST AROUND 20 TO 30 DOLLARS A PIECE AND YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE AT LEAST 3"
bad,"this place is a joke, management only cares about new customer deliverys. There isn't a good structure in place where employees are can develop within the company. Hr and management team do not help the employees"
bad,"was hired as sales manager but as doing servant job, cleaning, putting furniture together, going to dangerous , even scary places to repo furniture. Be away from this place... do not hire people as a manager if the job is not management."
bad,"Aaron's is a relatively new company, and exist as franchises and corporate facilities. They are not as organized as senior ""rent to own"" companies such as Rent-A-Center, yet it does provide employment to non-skilled laborers. The starting rate of pay is not bad for younger employees, although the work is physically demanding. However, Aaron's does provide great advancement opportunities, ranging from account executives (product deliverers) to sale associate, to assistant store manager, to general manager. The pay increases at each level are substantial and could provide a livable wage to non-degree holding employees. The health benefits and 401(k) benefits are relatively attractive if one is able to tolerate the work."
bad,The hardest part of the job is knowing that you might not have a job due to performance based on customer growth in a low-income housing area
bad,12 hour days everyday. No matter how hard you worked it was never enough. It's impossible to reach your quota. You could not keep employees the place is a revolving door.
bad,"There is nothing beneficial about working for Aaron's other than a paycheck, which will be far less than what you deserve.  For a company that overcharges customers for merchandise (by at least 100% more than other retailers), they don't spread the wealth at all.  Your entire day is literally spent at work, so if you have a family, good luck.  13 hr shifts 4-5 times a week is definitely not worth the sacrifice.  Not to mention that this is basically predatory lending where stores are usually located in low income neighborhoods.  As a manager trainee or customer accounts manager, all you do is make collection calls.  Your job is to get customers to pay their bills, and your job performance is solely based on that.  How your job performance can be based on people paying for stuff they couldn't afford in the first place is beyond me."
bad,"As a Manager Trainee, this was the worst experience in my life. poor management, no training, favortism, payroll deficiencies, no work/life balance, no camaraderie, over all a total zero."
bad,"At first glimpse, Aaron's seemed like the ideal job: benefits, full time position, etc but once you're in there Aaron's must become your life for you to be satisfied. You will not have time for anything else with this employer."
bad,Alot of unprofessional things  going on. People take advantage of there title. Think they can  intimidate  you.
bad,"Worked past midnight. Constantly. Never saw my family. "
bad,"I worked for Aaron's for 6 months. In my time there I was directed to call customers on a daily basis, which was fine considering the line of work. However, for customers who were very late on payments I was told to call multiple times a day. One such incident included calling a customer every 30 mins until we got an answer. This was very excessive. I work from 8 A.M. till 9 P.M. every day and after calling for a few hours I was on the road until closing. Pay was very low and work morale was horrible. My general manager made firing threats on a weakly basis, which he thought would get better results. The used furniture was never cleaned. The prices and total amount customers would pay was way too much for the cheap products Aaron's was selling as high quality. Do not work for such a company. Run away."
bad,worked as a customer service sales person. You have to buy your own shirts that you are required to wear for 40.00 to 50.00 a piece. This comes out of your first check. So first check is nothing. You get paid 9.00 an hour and they will not go higher. Say you will get eval once a year and get raise then. That never happened. You work with a red headed manager that talks about everyone to every person there and then when you confront her that you were told she talks about you she says the person that told you was a liar. She will get in the middle of your sales and end up taking them over. Then you do not get your extra 1.00 to 5.00 a sale commission. They want you to do 60 sales a week. This is impossible. Then it is 60 new sales every two weeks. This is still impossible in this area where there are two other rent to own type companies less than one mile from us with better deals and quality furniture. Told you would earn an extra 300.00 to 400.00 a month commission. This is not possible at this store.
bad,do not care about their product techs don't believe in safety of the pt will tell all your business behind your back two face people
bad,"Cons: Horrible management,No home life,Horrible benefits,They lie,"
bad,"Ghetto company."
bad,"Load and unload merchandise from trucks,keep my place to work clean and in order"
bad,"If you want to be micro managed and paid very little with always looking over your should and worrying about you job, this place is for you."
bad,"Most of what you will read in these reviews is true. Do not apply here if you have a family or any kind of life, unless you have no other options for employment. There is no job work/life balance. Of course with any company, your outside life is really your problem and not theirs, but there is absolutely no consideration given to family in scheduling. Compensation for any position lower than GM is nowhere near equal to the work and time you will put in, whether driver, csr, or even sales mgr, customer accounts mgr or manager in training. This is indeed a number based business, but that doesn't refer to just profit and loss, as the customers as well as the employees are treated as nothing but a number in a poorly organized file. I work with some great people here, but the majority of them, even the ones I encounter at other stores, are looking for other options having the exact same complaints I have listed, and that you will read in these other reviews. Only if you have no other choices for employment should you apply here."
bad,Company has strayed away from the basics that once made it dominant in the industry and both a place employees wanted to work and customers wanted to shop.
bad,Collections is all they have me doing. The Merchandise is not quality.
bad,"Catastrophic failure. "
bad,We can use very inappropriate practices to collect payment
bad,Having to try to collect money from people who cant afford the merchandise they were talked into rent and if you didn't collect the payment you were always threatened to be fired working 9 to 9 knocking on doors at till 10 min. before 9 people getting upset going to there house so late and going to there jobs embarrassing them in front of co. workers.
bad,"This was a hold over job until I could locate another position, the economy was very bad and jobs were not available in my field."
bad,"Management treats hourly workers like they are slaves , when they don't want to do their job they pawn it off to the hourly workers. Management lies to customers and treats customers unfairly."
bad,Plain and Simple: Horrible no real chance for advancement. The only guarantee I can assure any one of is promises and the false assurance of becoming a successful and accredited manager
bad,they don't do their JOB and makes OTHER person like bad. they got problems with black people. they want black people to be the under dog. DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM! C1159 STORE NUMBER
bad,"Aarons is a very disrespectful and a very harassing company. GM's and RM's are very, very disrespectful and harass customers and staff. Managers do not do their work and hand it down to other employees which cause us having to stay late and will then get angry that we are averaging too many hours. GM's and RM's have no respect for staff or customers that walk through their doors, they will use profane language and raise their voices at customers and staff. I face harassment every day by managers and regional managers."
bad,"Its ok overall looking for a career change, not that I don't like the job hours are overall to long I need to be part my daughters life more and take my experience somewhere else."
bad,"You work 12 hour shifts, are unable to see your family, and everything is politics. Promotions do not come with raises, just increased responsibility. Horrible atmosphere."
bad,"Wasting your time! If you dont have a life or family and want to be fell like they are using you. Then apply at aarons, other than that. Do not waste your time, all they do is lying to you. Didnt want to pay me my last commission because I didnt work the whole month!! Bunch of as...."
bad,I learned about the kind of manager that I did not want to be by working for this company
bad,"I worked for this company for almost 2 years...I worked under two different Customer Account Managers, one with no pride for their work and another who advanced by treating customers terribly. I also worked under 3 Sales Managers, one who got himself fired by stealing merchandise, another who was beyond lazy and another who treated his employees pretty badly. While I had a lot of respect for the General Manager, I got paid a horrible salary, got cussed out everyday by customers, moved heavy furniture and appliances by myself up flights of stairs, and even got guns pulled on me and threatened at the store. Still with all that I was nowhere near a promotion even though I only missed 3 days the entire time. Hard work gets no rewards here...If your goal is to move up in the company, only come in as a CAM or Sales Manager. Because as an MT or Customer Service Rep, you're nothing more than a slave."
bad,I didn't work for this company very long due to all the drama that was in this store.
bad,"A great to work until the company filed ch. 11"
bad,Don't waste your time.  Management lies and tells you empty promises. 
bad,everything they tell you is a lie job advancement is a joke they hire people they know to fill the management spots if you start as a pt and you want to move up they will drop your pay to move you up. they have no respect for the ones that do the real work for the company. the pts have no incentives to better themselves. they work the hardest and get paid the least amount of money. they take away what you have already earned if you quit because they are cheap and   dont want to spend the money they should be giveing to the people that earned it. this is a billion dollar a year company and they pay like nothing. this company is the worst ive ever worked for and ive had some harder jobs. i would rather work at a dollar store just because they treat me better. i worked for aarons for 4 years and and only made it up to 11 an hour. then they wonder why we get all mad off with them doing all the hard work and not getting our worth. 
bad,This company does not care nor treat there employees very well. i do not recomend working for this company. 
bad,Boss former hells angels....like that to be known. Staff are disposable creates toxic violent atmosphere.Boss fire anyone who sticks up for their legal rights. All staff are either or former substance abuse. work with no planed 2 week schedule.
bad,"If you are hired to work at one of the store you will be promised the world. You will start off in the Manager in training program. There you will work 45-50 hours per week. You are treated like a dog and do all the dirty work such as cleaning the merchandise. If you do stay long enough to make General Manager (which shouldn’t be long because of the high turnover) you will work 80 to 90 hours a week, paged at home about your numbers, talked to by upper management and owners like a slave, cussed at, asked to do things against company policy and then if you get caught the say they never told you to do it and asked to lie to customers. This company is always in a law suite of some sort and they find scapegoats in the general managers. Please don’t even think about this company. I was there for a year and a half. I made GM in 7 months and saw 11 GM get fired over something that upper management told they to do then they denied it. I complained to upper management about the treatment of GMs and was told that they don’t expect GMs to stay more than a couple of years. They can get new ones cheaper."
bad,They use you until you they don't need you. Managers have no control to do anything in there store. Avoid this company.
bad,"I was a gm for 5 years before I couldn't take anymore, upper management would tell me not to hire woman for certain position which. I had a problem with, upper management would constantly threaten your job almost daily, the CEO and CFO do NoT care turned my boss in to upper management and they threatened me because they were afraid of a lawsuit , absolute worst company to work for they do NOT care about you they only care about using you up and when there done your gone if anything other than a customer service rep or delivery driver you will have No life, a d if you become a manager you will have. No personal life period this company is disgusting. Oh and you are expected to work 55 to 60 unless u don't have an assistant manager if that's the case you will be working 70 hours this is a fact !! Anyone stating different is lying. Again stay away if you know what's good for you."
bad,Management suck they take sides they want us pts to do everyone's job plus ours sometimes we won't get out until 11 even 12 one time we got out around 1am two days before christmas breaks are ridiculous most days we will go about 7 hours without eating while everyone else take their lunch between one and three in the afternoon at the beginning of the job it's was awsome I always wanted to be a delivery guy but then I started to realize that pts do everything in the store I mean everyone's job I hate my job now the ones the get payed more than me get to slack off all day all they do all day is guys do this do that move this move that and all they do Is stand around and chat all day do not recommend this job in the rio grande valley not a good environment to work at
bad,no room for advancement in the company. Lack of upper Management
bad,gas up work van and document data. drive to stores location and begin merchandising. first theres a delivery of beer pallets andyou must sort the load into your backstock. after that you then complete the filling of the stores cold box. then u have to organize your load into your backstock because you have to rotate the dates of the beer.finish that store and move onto the next one.
bad,"Everything from general managers to regional managers are horrible. The company and their managers don't show any value in their employees. Pay sucks, for the amount of work and time you put into the job. I would never recommend anyone to work or even shop at this store."
bad,Overall not a good company based on promoting from within due having terrible people within upper management. No work life balance and the pay for the work being done does not even compare.
bad,Very unorganised hot and poor lighting smells like the dog food plant next door . It is run like an illegal sweat shop. Slow to repay travel expences. No employee parking.Long hours low pay.Former employee of Woodhaven Mattress in Fairburn Ga.
bad,From start to finish no one cares about you. Regional manager threatens job over and over. They will have short staff and no bonus for overtime
bad,Typical retail rental chain store. Poor management at the location I worked for. Crooked collections department. Bad Morals. Just a lot of the behind the scenes things that went on I didn't know about till close to my resignation time.
bad,"Company hires you in stating that in 3 to 4 months you will be running a store and making 100+K per year. After 3 years you might get a store and then you will be expected to work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Life work balance is completely out of whack and they expect you to drop everything whenever they want you to even if your store in performing at company standard or above. Upper management does nothing but report and talk down to you on a routine basis. No matter what you are doing well in they accentuate your deficiencies in every phone call."
bad,Not a good company to work for. Poor company values and management are self-centered.
bad,At first I loved but the management there is insane and they use you up and do not care for their employees.
bad,If you make it to GM the company will pay you handsomely. Any position under GM has low pay for what the jobs entail.
bad,The company used to care about the customer and employees not anymore constant threats for your job and fake advertising good people doing good things
bad,"If you want to get divorced and not have a relationship with your kids, and work 60 hrs per week? This is the job for you. "
bad,"When working for Aaron’s I was given the opportunity to move up within the company and did just that   I moved to sales manager after just a few months and then at that point realized, Aaron’s was not the right place for me.  The moment that sealed it for me was when the regional manager yelled at me in front of paying customers.   I was on my way to feel a spot where a customer had just bought furniture and that’s when the regional manager started his rampage   He was very unprofessional and I don’t recommend atone ever working there"
bad,Sad. Never felt welcomed by coworkers. Spend 9 hrs standing while owner/management sits on their phone. Sales manager constantly making fun of me in front of customers. Pay was okay but no time for any life whatsoever.
bad,No one cares about you as a person. It's all numbers. You are a number only. There are people leaving this company as fast as they can. Just  Don't do it
bad,"The culture of a historic company that changed an industry, has been washed away by new faces trying to reinventing the wheel.  COO comes in fresh off the failure of payless shoes, no Rto background.  Watched a company I was with for 20 lose it culture month by month.  Failed program by program & 6 day work week"
bad,Management sucks. They lure you in with kindness then won't look you in the eye like they're above you. The garbage merch you have to pick up from angry customers is usually filthy or broken and you have to try and salvage it. Don't waste your time.
bad,"Horrible place to work if your a delivery driver your over worked and underpaid, long hours and no time for your family. Bi weekly pay and unorganized"
bad,"Company does not care about their employees, no appreciation for your hard work if you don’t meet your sales goals, rules always change so be prepared"
bad,"This company has done a total 360 in the past 2 to 3 yrs.  They use to care about their employees and now they only care about $$!  There’s no culture, no consistency, & no values and the sad part is these are the things Aaron’s was built on.  They only encourage hiring part time associates to prevent from having to offer them benefits & then work them crazy hours.  They have become a reactive company instead of the proactive company they’ve always been."
bad,Upper management doesn't care about anyone. Just making the money. No home life at all. Your forced to do your job and the job of your boss. Then get fired for doing what everyone else in the store does. With no warning.
bad,Was once a good company to work for. New leadership has lost a distinct mission and target market. Has lost generational customers by alienating them. Attempting to capture a new market that does not want to purchase in the Rent to Own retailers.
bad,"Not anyplace that I would suggest anyone to work for, unless you have no family or any hobbies. It's a fight to request days off. The regional manager for where I worked was a complete joke. He had no idea how to handle any situation that would present itself to him. The pay is a joke for management. Not a good place."
bad,"I will never work for Aarons again. Went through 3 managers while I worked there. None were any good at leading. Great at telling people what to do, but terrible at actually LEADING. Then you also have to deal with infestations like Bed bugs and roaches. Which are easily brought home to your family. Then when you say something about it they give you ""Stero-Fab"" to spray on your clothes and skin, which could be harmful. If you do not know what that is, it is a pesticide, germicide, mildewicide, and all those in one. Its powerful and dangerous if inhaled, ingested, or possibly even if on your skin. The truck that we were made to drive every day almost always had the check engine light and ABS lights on. The work to home ratio is terrible. I seriously missed all my kids concerts, practices, games, first steps, first words.. All of that. Then comes the TERRIBLE WORKERS COMP. I had a 28 cubic foot fridge fall on me, then when my coworker tried to get it off me, lost his grip and it fell on me again. Im hurting still to this day from this accident in almost every location of my body. I was told if i wasnt cleared to come back to work on full duty i would no longer have my job. Although there are plenty of light duty responsibilities to tend to. Refused to cover medical bills, refused to pay me my time i missed, and of course telling me all of this AFTER the deadline to take it to the labor board or whatever it is. "
bad,Management was shifty and lied about many things. Also gave my long awaited promotion to a very new employee (2 months) after I was there for 1 year. They claimed that they didnt know I wanted it but I knew it was because they discriminated against me. I had over 3.5 years experience with the company.
bad,"They were insanely sexist, calling me little girl and saying that my job was more of being a maid than working with ""the more important people"". They made me take ALL the phone calls even when I was dealing with customers in the store and already on a call. They are extremely disrespectful when it comes to dealing with customers behind the scenes. In the end, I was fired for leaving early once and I filed a lawsuit against them. I was left at the office alone and/or when the manager would NAP. They would leave to take personal phone calls and leave to go get Wawa when they weren't clocked out or they would go to Game Stop. They have also come in with hangovers and/or would come in drunk or sick from drinking."
bad,Assisted in store clean up and delivery's. Assisted truck driver for hauling appliances. Assisted with throwing out a poorly smelled bed. Assist with going to customers that owed money to the company. Customers didn't pay rent on time.
bad,"As the sales manger is responsible for EVERYTHING. The floor, filling holes,doing returns, serve issues, pricing, you'll be lucky to get any help from your GM, CAM or anyone else. Be prepared for hella drama & backstabbing.THE PAY IS NOT worth it!"
bad,The SRM tried to get me wrongfully fired for something that I didn't do. And when they closed the location down it was kept a secret from the employees up until the last 3 days before the lease was up. I worked from 8 am to 9pm it wasn't a choice. We were always short staffed and when I tried to move up they said that I didn't qualify for a higher position because I don't have experience. And when I tried for a lower position they said that I had to move up to something higher. And when I put my 3 weeks notice they were trying to move me up but only if I stayed and waited for something to open up.
bad,no life outside of aarons. company will plumit to the ground. customers are almost all complete trash. be prepared to get into fights over a tv or couch.
bad,"Aaron’s Is Ok, But They Want You To Give Your Life Up For Them. When They Easily Can Replace You. You Are Going To See Aarons More Than Your Family. It’s Not Worth It"
bad,"Don't bother with this one. They will work you and send you places that need to be condemned. They don't care, as long as they get sales... Your input will be viewed as invalid. Trust me, you will want to leave soon after starting."
bad,They don't care about you or your family and they talk down to you and demoralize you constantly. They make you work more then 12 hours a day and give you Chinese overtime.
bad,Poor management numbers game all serice center have the same issues management needs lots of training in the field of working with people it's a starter job I would never plan my future with this company
bad,"The actual managers of the stores are alright, but the regional managers and up treat Aarons Sales and Lease like a pyramid scheme. As long as they can get numbers up (people they rip off) they do not care about customer service at all. They are abusive to employees mentally and verbally, but keep it within unwritten guide lines so you cannot sue or get them into trouble."
bad,"Aaron's is the worse job i ever had, my role at Aaron's was a PT(Product Technician)/Deliver driver. Aaron's pays way to little for what they expect of this position the expect you to clean merchandise they you didn't return even though they say you return it you clean it but they would let the merchandise sit in the back when you are busy even if the store is empty and the rest of the staff has nothing else to do. The had me out picking up payments which is not my job, they have you doing two man deliveries by yourself and still expect you to get it done quickly, Aaron's discounts for employees suck butt, and when comes to raises don't look for what you deserve because you are not going to get it not even a percentage of it.   Once again the worse job i have ever had in my life wouldn't go back if my life depended on it!!!!!!!!"
bad,"There is a complete lack of planning, direction and culture at the higher levels of the organization which has filtered down throughout the company.  Additionally, its an organization that touts employee appreciation in its training materials and other communications, but fails to model any of these in their actions resulting in unprecedented turnover rates."
bad,"If you want to get screwed over go work for these guys, the lads were good to work with but management will deduct your money for silly reasons. Travel payments were a joke and were calculated on "" how the crow flies attitude"" best thing I ever did was to leave this place and feel sorry for the decent lads and office staff who are still there."
bad,"This company leads you with a carrot to get you in and then holds you responsible for departments not in your control. The collections department sucks big time. They are supposed to keep customers, not return their items just because they are to lazy to do their jobs! There is no family/work balance at all. This is no place to work if you have a family!"
bad,I could tell you how bad it is working for companies like this is but it really is not worth my time..what I will tell you is..it's not worth you time either so please for your sake to not waste your time.
bad,"no advancement opportunities ... trying to request vacation time from management is a hassle  ....  management in most stored is ok , but others need alot of help. some employees get talked down to ... not worth it ...."
bad,"The position at this store comes with bedbugs along with lies, corrupt culture, and a RM who doesn't follow policy or rules. The franchise owner has not a clue of the stores and what goes on only what is reported after cover ups of the rm and reports emailed to them. The store has numerous reports against it for bedbugs, also the sell furniture to unknowing ""victoms"" customers of the bedbugS they are recieving into their home till its to late. I recommend you stay as far away from this company as possible."
bad,This company replaces people none stop most only last a year they usually will let you work out the day then fire you at the end with replacement already in place. Rotten company to work for.
bad,"Hired as a CSR, and was told my job responsibilities. Was specifically told I would not be going out in the field, that my main focus would be the customer service aspect (hence the CSR; customer service rep). Then customers would come into the store and they would literally tell me to worry more about filling holes in the sales floor, or send me out in the field. "
bad,"Started in there Management training program and after one year I was an Account Manager and all without a salary increase, worst management program I've seen, The Regional Manager always came to the store with an attitude and never had anything positive to said, I worked very long hours for a small salary, this company doesn't care about there customers or there employees, all they care is about sales, with that kind of revolving door attitude they're never getting good people to working for them, even when I resign to my position they never paid me for my vacation, this company really sucks."
bad,"They'll hire you as a manager in training but change you to customer service representative, it's how they get you in the door."
bad,"trying to find out who is your boss for that day"
bad,"Great job if you like calling people all day long, leaving them messages at home and work, then spending the evening going to their house to get payment or merchandise.  Having a gun pulled on me over a lap top computer is not my idea of a good job,  Constant pressure cooker environment to collect payments or merchandise."
bad,Don't expect to have a social life. Paperwork is not done before you get to work so you have to wait 2 hours to start delivering. Some days didn't get a lunch break. Never ask management for anything because it won't be done. They couldn't even figure out how to do employee purchases. Don't expect to get off or near your scheduled time off and expect to work 45+ hours a week for 9.00$/hr. The management is always right so don't bother arguing. Be expected to do things against company policy. If you don't want bed bugs(yes they are real) then don't work here.
bad,"This place is where the lazy brown noses get promoted, the harder you work the more you get brushed aside. Now I loved this job when I first started, but this store has spiraled downhill fast.The regional manager is the most hypocritical two faced man I have ever met. He knowingly allowed employees to keep and maintain customers credit card information even when one was stolen and used. Company policies that are clearly in place for a reason were of no importance to him when brought to his attention. His way of solving these problems was to tell employees partaking to keep it hush hush and not let anyone find out they had been breaking rules just to be sure they still hit their numbers. He would call and stir the pot just for amusement, and forget chain of command because if you go over his head.. You are done with the company, he will find a way to get rid of you even if he has to step in himself. Do yourself a favor and stay away from here, weather it's to buy something or to work it is not worth your time."
bad,"First and foremost I worked there for 6 years. what I experienced should have been reported and investigated but I constantly feared for My job. My supervisor was extremely racist and evil. I could not report any of the abuse I went through because he was connected with the ""good ol boys"" club and the HR department. Even when I did speak out there was severe retaliation. I was constantly cheated on My pay and always overworked. I can't overstate how much I was treated like dirty. My manager along with the rest of the lazy racist staff would bad mouth me to customers as well as anyonewho would listen. I would never recommend this company to anyone friend or foe."
bad,"Typically you come in at 8am and leave at 9pm Monday through Friday, and 730am to 63pm on Saturdays. You never get days off because upper management will tell you, you don't deserve a day off or your numbers aren't good enough to take a day off. They say they schedule you GM's for 50 hours a week but I was a GM for 2 years and in my case my regional told me that I was the one to set the alarm off in the morning (8am) and at night (9pm). Anyone that can do basic math can see that this is way more than 50 hours and it is not including Saturday. My regional manager actually would write people up for not doing so. You will be set with goals that are not attainable the upper management says they used to get those goals but things are different now a days. Upper management was in my store one day and they did not even know how to do a charge off recovery yet they expect you to answer to them and achieve these goals when they obviously just fell into their job or put up with all the stuff and stuck it out for years. Upper management also replaced my regional with another one that had been doing ""great"" numbers in his previous region yet he was with us for a year and our region had the 2nd worst numbers in the company. Upper management is always looking to point the finger and blame someone else instead of stepping in and helping out or making sure a store is properly staffed. If you work for this company you will hate life because you will have none. The only reason this job seems to have room for advancement is because people are always quitting or getting fired. When it comes to"
bad,"Typical day for me was listening to my general manager trash talk any and every customer the store has. Perform everyone else's job including my own. No one helps the product technicians and they expect you to do anything at a drop of a hat, god forbid u are physically exhausted from multiple deliveries. the higher up people only care about money, and dont care who they embarass trying to get it."
bad,"The co-workers are great, but the management team and compensation are terrible."
bad,i loved my job was easy learned alot in sales and all.most of my co workers i loved working with the 2nd regional i had was a different story if you didnt weigh or look a certain way he wanted you out unfortunately for him because of my sales he had no excuse to fire me so he had to live with it.i would never work there because he even went as far to say he wouldnt hire a woman for a pt because women couldnt do the drivers jobs only men could and then when i was threatened by another employee and the regional told me to stick it out and that he wasnt going to further investigate the situation i had to walk because of that reason not because i didnt like my job because i loved it i loved being able to make account calls and handle situations that a manager normally would i loved my coworkers we had fun and worked at the same time one employee faked an injury it was an injury that person had prior and got to sit down all day and take pills all day and tell customers how messed up they were that also had me walk out because i dont agree with that behavior in a work place no matter if you are on workmanscomp that person wore see through shirts thongs showing all day long and yet i got in trouble for wearing the wrong color blouse aarons doesnt care for all employees like they claim they dont let you advance i asked to be promoted was told no they didnt like me i didnt have it in me since i walked out of the store the store has gone from 620 customers to 500 in a month and a half that should tell you something about how well the regional and company lets the regional do what he wants
bad,Place is horrible since corporate and new ceo took over. They took away commission and bonuses from employees. The store manager only receives bonus and that isnt fair to the associates who bust their butts all month!!!! They will hire inexperienced drivers and no proper training. The sales associates are lazy. The account team are rude and threaten customers. The store manager with throw employees under the bus. threththreatenincustcustomersallthetime.
bad,"If you like running into bed bugs, heroin needles, and being given no safety equipment; this job is for you. I was extra careful and still winded up infesting my home with bed bugs (I spent hundreds getting rid of them). "
bad,"Plain and simple do not work in this toxic and negative environment with this so called ""mgr "" ..HATEFUL ,RUDE ,AND MORE OR LESS NOT WORTH THE STRESS  . TURNOVER IS HIGH AND it's gotta mean something when no one cares to work for you . Dare I say discrimination to the fullest as far as men versus women and trashes employees right in front of other employees ..Good job ""mgr "" !"
bad,They over work employees by scheduling them to 11 hr days plus weekends. If store is not doing good they make people work mandatory 7 days a week. Management team does not support or care about employees. The training is minimal and they throw you right in without even knowing company policy or procedures. Constant battle between sales team and nons dept. Constantly dealing with irate customers and having to field visit those same people. Most of the homes are in dangerous parts of Waukegan and your forced to use your own phone for gps or to call the customers. They tell you is only collections but then send you on deliveries also and your dealing with roaches and bed bugs at customers home and in the store. Stay away from this company trust me
bad,"District manager cheats with coworkers and if you know anything they will fire you. They allowed the drivers to smoke weed, and district manager she bought it. Its very unprofessional work environment."
bad,The have a good old boy mentality they want you to be on the job every day of the week you should not have a family life working for them so many employees have quit because of this mentality lack of support for job hired or promoted
bad,They work you like a slave for a little bit of nothing and you start at 6am and have no off time also the manager was always riding people and making them stay late so he could get his bonuses but you don't get not one bit of them.
bad,"12 hour work days,  no work life balance.  Micromanage to death every manager has two more managers.  Commission dangled but rarely paid.  Unreasonable expectations."
bad,"Management was a joke and they would just hire they're own buddies. Which caused so much favoritism and made it harder for manager to fire employees underperforming just because they were friends. 12 hour days. Saturdays start at 730am. They will take advantage of you to work Sundays to deliver, pick up, clean and anything they feel they want you to do. Even outside your job description. ECOMMERCE IS A JOKE. THEY ARE BARELY CATCHING UP TO ALREADY ADVANCED COMPANIES. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT EMPLOYEES."
bad,IT side of Aarons has a weak management structure.  Top to bottom.  Some teams constantly look to expose and put down other teams.  Rarely are all the teams looking to work together to solve common problems.  No structure.  Management does not know what they are doing.
bad,The company as a whole has a very good culture and their future seems bright. Unfortunately when things go wrong the company acts as if noting is wrong and sweeps the dishonest people under the rug.
bad,"slow, boring job. if you dont have a good co worker you will be doing most of the lifting and work by yourself. quiet in store do to slow business. but delivering to customer's houses no telling what you are going to see"
bad,Working there you got make sure everything is set for store open hours for customer take payments over the phone . but if the account is more than 5 days due you have to pass phone call to the account management . to verified that you payment option are  correct and the due date is right for you .
bad,"Not many options in a small town, however this was not the company that rewards hard work. High pressure environment and no upper management support. Often mocked for asking questions that were needed to run the store."
bad,"When I first applied I was excited to be working for this company, not even much time later this has all changed. A toxic work environment along with a GM who doesn't even care is a formula for stress and people won't want to show up for work. The compensation is ok but leaves much to be desired. I want to believe it's the location and I'm sure other stores are doing what they need to be the best around but this one isn't good at all. Think long and hard before applying."
bad,"As a developer, working in home office, there are training opportunities and flexibility to get your hands wet doing different things. The office is ok and and pretty new, and the location is ok. "
bad,I like how they say one of their benefits is promoting through the company. What a joke. They just started this new direction BS which is way worse for store associates and benefits only upper management. Most stores are terribly managed and everyone complains but management doesn't fix anything. Long story short terrible company to work for. Wouldn't recommend it.
bad,"More of a cult environment. The management style is somewhat from the 90's...motivation by intimidation. The pay is horrible and the working conditions are less desirable. The management team has no experience and is more of a do as I say, when I say it."
bad,"Horrible management from the GM to the RM .. "
bad,I loved the people I worked with. Hated just about everything else. I lived 5 minutes away from my store and still barely had any time left in the day to myself after getting off. Not fair to have 10+ hour days for such little pay. Couldn't even get another job to make more money because I worked 7am-8pm. Was unable to have an actual life while working this job and the pay sucked.
bad,"You will have no work life balance, you will be underpaid and if you are the GM if you will have to deal with underpaying your staff drastically and you will only ever get ahead if you scratch the right backs or knock back drinks with the right higher up. Dealing with people who day in and day out fight you on why they cant or wont pay their rental bills (renewal payments) is mind numbing and soul crushing. Save yourself a lot of stress and misery and self hatred and move on."
bad,"The pay did not cover the work put in, security of the employees was non, the working conditions were lacking, the management work more for their bonus and not for the employees."
bad,I like the emloyees I work with and I do not mind delivering furniture. The christmas bonuses are good and the discount on furniture is pretty good. That is all
bad,"Not a great company, long hours, too much pressure and stress. Management do not care about you, if you don't like something then 'there's the door' attitude. Don't go there, you have been warned."
bad,really didnt enjoy my job at dish becuase their was always problems with the customers furniture and it was so hard to get new furniture for great customers
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for. The store recently got out of a HUGE  scandal before I was hired. Favoritism & Butt kissing goes on a lot, I was a PT. They sent us out by OURSELVES to deliever W29s & if you're familiar with Aaron's you know that's the heaviest couch on the floor. Didn't mind the work & delivering to trap houses up 2 flights of stairs you kind of need more than a dolly. Don't become a PT AKA delivery driver if you're looking for a position at Aaron's. shoot for something easy & lazy like a sales manager or CSR. F AARONS."
bad,"The one thing that I can say about Aaron's is that it's a steady job if you perform.  That's about it. 13 hour days and working every weekend aren't necessarily worth the headache of being screamed at by customers daily, threatened and generally abused.  The ""bonuses"" they offer are a pittance in comparison to what the collections teams go through."
bad,The management in the Chico ca location is honestly horrible and very disrespectful especially to female employees. Very unprofessional. Pay was good but putting up with disrespect was not worth it.
bad,Rude lier people works here Don't work or shop here They won't help you and will make fun of you do not ever shop here ever I don't work there.but was a customer and now I won't ever shop here
bad,"Long Hours"
bad,the job was forced on you and had no life after working there. Management was terrible and really didn't care about customers.
bad,"very stressful, too much micromanaging and harassment.  horrible upper managing  but I love the customers co-workers no. the hard part is no team work because of the management"
bad,"Run Forrest, Run.  This is an ok job if you have issues with gaining employment.  Poorly ran and poor management of merchandise.  The only good thing about this job is that the operating system that is used"
bad,"""Good benefits and decent hours its nice to have Sundays off and holidays not to mention after 6 months you get a week of vacation"" However fussy customers can cause stress. Sometimes sales goals are unfair for delivery drivers. (personal thought) Internal management poorly picked!"
bad,"Poor compensation"
bad,"Terrible work environment! It is always unorganized, you have no help and for some reason you always have racist co-workers working there. Merchandise is always breaking down and be prepared to resell ""Roach"" infested merchandise that gets returned from customer homes."
bad,"The job is hard. Hard labor, little pay, managers are not friendly. Hours are terrible. No weekends off"
bad,"Get your own load together, deliver by yourself if needed by schedule usually 5-9 stops from five minutes to one hour from the store,clean merchandise and organize warehouse,unload trucks, stock showroom, load customers, take out trash,make phone calls for non-payments,visit non-payments, return lots of merchandise, repair nonrepairable merchandise, keep trucks cleaned, help with customers if available too,do paperwork,communicate issues with management.In the same day. They have no respect for hard workers.Inexperienced management.Co-workers are gone.The hardest part is taking a 275 pound sofa up three flights of stairs in a 120 degree narrow stairway physically.Mentally dealing with bad decisions handed down to you to deal with.The most enjoyable part was outside of the store giving excellent delivery service to all customers and helping people."
bad,"Working at Aaron's Inc. was horrible! You started your day calling customers from a pre-generated call sheet who had not yet made their payments in an attempt to collect from them. After that it was usually lunch time. After eating on the fly, you had to set up a list of home visits for people that you could not reach on the phone to attempt to collect from them in person. If they did not have payment on hand, you often had to remove the property from their homes in sometimes unsafe homes or unsafe areas. Most of the property had been destroyed or was filthy and infested with various insects (mostly roaches). "
bad,There are things that unorganized and no structure in management
bad,"The pay is decent, but overall the company and its management is shady and suspect. If you have a family this is not the job for you."
bad,Manager would not come in till mid day. The files process was not done completely. The long hours of collections was not a plus. Due to making sure that customers that were past due. Ensuring that they made there payments on the merchandise. I also would have to clean the merchandise of the returned product. What i learned most of this sitiuation is that ensuring that my crew would have motivation and drive to get to that next level of management.
bad,i was injured there and they don't like to take care of there people they do bad business 
bad,"I hated working there, I was the number one sales rep for my store in New Rochelle. I was fired because my child was in the hospital, Do yourself a favor and not work there."
bad,Management was worthless. They all blamed each other for their mistakes. Constantly worked over time because they couldn't get their job done on time. Company is built around ripping people off as much as possible.
bad,"This company was terrible to work for. Extremely long hours, usually 8am-9pm Monday-Friday and 7:30am-6:30pm on Saturdays. Once you become manager of a store you do not get days off and god forbid you try to schedule yourself for one, your manager will call to your store and tell you how bad of a job your doing and you do not deserve a day off. Telling you, you can take the day off but it won't be in your best interest. Extremely stressful environment with goals that are unachievable. Upper management always will find someone else to blame and constantly threaten your job. They have no compassion for you or your family. All they want from you is to work, work, work. Upper management will roll over if you get a customer complaint but if you handle the situation without it getting to them and do the same thing they would do they will wig out on you and write you up. They make you work late on holidays and will ""recommend"" you going in on Sundays. You will have no life if you work for this place. They make it seem like you can make good money here but with the amount of hours they make you work it comes out to you making about minimum wage and you get paid salary so they really screw you over. You have to deal with some of the nastiest, low life customers ever. They feel entitled to everything and their houses are covered in roaches and trash. Collections are harrassment, they will make you call 6, 7 times a day, call all of their relatives and embaress them by telling all of the customers business and even threaten them with legal matters. If they are one day late you have to"
bad,Terrible compensation for all the hours and work you put in.
bad,if your the type of person who enjoys being with your family and friends and being able to have any kind of life this job is not for you.the hours are odd and that allows no time to do anything with anybody except oon your split days off. also if you like a job that is orginized and you work as a cohesive team best to keep looking that does not occur at aarons. the managers all have an idea of the way things should be ran which is normal and expected but you also expect them to all agree on that and run the store together but that just doesn't happen here.that leaves all of the other employees running in circles trying to figure out how they need to do things and in what order. if you are desperate for a job apply but if you'd rather stay sane and get a job that pays you a fair wage for what you do then keep looking!
bad,"Work is steady, you can not follow their structure of business, for they change it at a whim. Bad Management is everywhere, but they like to retain the bad management till enough people quit that specific store. expect to be placed in several stores, with no new compensation, can be up to 50-80 mile drive one way to a different store. Work hours change as they wish, sometimes even the same day. Upper management doesn't resolve any real issues, they repeat what you say to the person in question, and becomes more drama added to your work life."
bad,"I worked there for four years as a General Manager, upper management is a joke, they treat there employees like garbage, expect you to work for 70 hours a week without any overtime pay, they will mentally abuse you and think nothing about terminating you, if your a woman plan on NOT moving up the ladder, they have a strong discrimination against woman at Aarons. AVOID at all cost."
bad,Regional managers needs to respect their associates more. Working with my fellow co-workers was not bad and having the opportunity to work with the customers was the best part of the job.
bad,"When I first started 2 years ago it felt like I was apart of a family, And now it’s feels like I’m simply just another worker who can/will get replaced at the drop of a dime."
bad,"No support to do said job, very disorganized company. The higher ups do not do their jobs. Work gets pushed around. I would not recommend. It is only good temporarily but the turnover rate is very high."
bad,The company itself is awesome and i do plan to reapply at a different location. The store i worked at for 3 years had a terrible environment and managment didn't care. Then i filed a harrasment compliant against a co-worker and was immediately terminated.
bad,"I spent to many hrs there in a day, I would have to be there from 7:30am to 9:30 pm. The store mgrs. Didn't want to do their part on their bucket. They would want me ( CAM ) do the front, middle and the back bucket. The regional manager that was there was a good boss to a point. The Sales Mgr. Wouldn't do her point and she would blame her mistakes on other people."
bad,"The management at Aaron's is awful. Berates the staff in front of customers and other staff, and has no shame. I tried to stick out my two weeks, but ended up quitting mid shift, which is not iny character. This place has caused me to have anxiety attacks, question my morals, and many sleepless nights. I'd be verbally attacked by the manager and made to feel guilty for the mishaps that have happened and blamed for missing orders and MISSING MERCHANDISE. Really toxic work environment, I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies; if I had any. I would never and will never return her as an employee or customer. Ever."
bad,"This is my second time with aarons,  first was the early 2000s and while it was never perfect, it was workable and manageable."
bad,The place is filled with roaches and bed bugs they don't care what condition anything was brought back in as long as they can write it off I ended up getting roaches at my own house because of this the management is too busy being accommodating to certain employees and pushing the employees that they know will do whatever they need them to while they claim to appreciate your efforts really just feels like you're being taken advantage of While others are put before you and they make hardly any effort too much family hired too closely and favoritism
bad,its a ok place if u want to be stuck in one job with no career advancement opportunity or raises u will only get a raise if u are friends with ine of the hire up food change manager
bad,"You can learn a lot from the retail aspect,such as sales and account collections, however there is no room for growth if you do not have an in to the ""good ol' boy club"""
bad,Same long hours...no benefits..management is a joke...wouldn't want anyone if they have children to go thru that..find yourself other Avenues and dont trust then
bad,"The store i was at was just awful.  Aarons as a company has a wonderful culture, and if things were done as policy dictates, I believe it would be a nice place to work and shop.   But when store manager is insecure and demands it be"" his way"".  The store fails and everything crumbles."
bad,"This place is horrible to work for the management treats you like garbage and customers, there raises are horrible doesn't matter how long you've been employed with them they don't pay the delivery drivers fair though there the one doing the hard work trucks stink they don't provide tools personal tools get stolen"
bad,They fire people and dont even give you a reason. They wont tell you what they think you did. The manager is the only one allowed to get weekends off and two days in a row off. They are not good at training people. They think if you watch a video one time you are an expert on how to do it. I really was just starting to feel comfortable in the job when they let me go. They tell you to get your sales up on friday and so you do on saturday you make all the sales for the day come monday morning they fire you for doing what they asked
bad,"On salary and expected to work 60+ hours a week. Owners don't honour warranties which makes like more stressful dealing with customers. Pays are often missed , pay cycle changed.  5 different general managers in Moncton store alone and 6 different Regional managers in the last two year should tell you a lot about this franchise..."
bad,This company acts like you are important but as a delivery driver you are very clearly not important.  The lack of pay or bonuses is a start. The pt is literally the backbone of Aarons but treated the worst.
bad,"The hours at Aarons are insane, they expect you to work 12 to 14 hour days sometimes longer and be OK with that, you have no time to be at home with your family, this job is OK for someone who is single and does not want a family.  The team currently working at Aarons is awesome however upper management will all but take your soul away and keep dangling your job over your head.  They make threats thinking that this will somehow make you perform better, one thing they need to know is that working long insane hours ruins a persons moral and burns them out it does not make the person work harder to reach goals. This job will ruin your family and social life."

bad,no culture bad upper management having to go to customers home to collect can be a problem at time low pay unless ur management constant change in upper
bad,"You make 400 calls within 4 hours. And you are timed, the General Manager is all over you. You negotiate payment arrangements with customers who don't have the money to pay. I learned how to negotiate, count money, make deposits at the bank. And I learned people skills which gave me edge above my co-workers. And I also learned how to manage assets for the company both merchandise and people(over 1000 customers) Management is like a bucket full of crabs. They were trying to talk me out of getting my MBA. My General Manger was jealous of me. The hardest part was working from 9am to 9 pm sometimes. No day light to spare. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting on the truck and negotiating payment dates."
bad,"I stuck it out and worked for this company for almost 5yrs and never felt like my performance was appreciated. This is a company that strives for profits, and nothing else, at the expense of its customers and staff. Upper management and gm are awful at all locations in aware of, and you will be asked to give up your morals and personal life for a pay check. Be prepared to get thrown under the bus, lied too, constantly asked to work late sometimes of the clock, and belittled regardless of your work performance. To sum it up, dont hit the submit button."
bad,From other employee reviews it seems like my experience was a location specific issue. It was an franchise operation and I do not have much to say that is good about it. The location is closed and seems fitting. Others seem to have had much more pleasant experiences at other locations. Take my review with a grain of salt.
bad,I hate my job. It's like high school there. Everyone gossips and acts like children. The hours are terrible. The management is awful to the customers. The prices are too high and the pay is no good.
bad,"Benefits are decent "
bad,"Poor management at my specific store. Didn't feel as if we were all a team working toward common goals. Management had ""favorites""."
bad,"Aarons is a joke the work schedule was stupid, who wants to have day off on a Thursday. I was scheduled for appointment to get a knee surgery manager said when I'm healed he will give me my job back but had to start over. Once my knee was healed Manger never called back or no so if you work for Aaron's don't apply for the one in Chelten Ave."
bad,"terrible company to work for. no room for advancement, low pay, and even more terrible work environment.  Worse managed company ever."
bad,"I was promised career growth in six months and I still have not received it, and i have been a solid employee since 5/20/13; which is why I am seeking a career change, stabilty, life balance, etc."
bad,"over worked, lied to about promotions, broken promises about raises, they cancel your bonus checks if you upset the DM. 2 years working in the same store, I saw 6 GMs, 5 Sales managers, 4 Customer accounts managers, and 2 DMs for that store. as soon as an employee or customer leaves everyone does nothing but trash talk them..... and best part the married with kids DM was sleeping with employees to give them promotions and raises. reported it to HR and nothing was done about it."
bad,This company is for people who doesnt have a family. As an employee you will work an average of 10 to 12 hours a day.
bad,I can't speak for all Aaron's franchise stores or corporate stores but the franchise i worked for was horrible. The problem is at the top with the franchise principal who was never available and rarely visits the stores. Made decisions based on rumors instead of what is best for the business. I could go on but the bottom line is I think Aaron's is a great company just not the particular franchise I worked for.
bad,"The most cut-throat business out there. They prey on low income families who can't keep up with their payment plans. It can be very rewarding financially, but be prepared to knock on someones door at 5am to repo their bedroom furniture."
bad,"This company is not worth working for, management wants everything, until you sell your soul..."
bad,"I work at our divisional office as the Home Staging Representative. I deal with clients that want to lease furniture for corporate apartments and for staging vacant homes that are for sale. I was previously the Regional Merchandiser, and covered 22 store locations. The Regional Merchandiser position has been eliminated, and the Home Staging Representative position will be eliminated soon, due to sales not being as high as expected."
bad,Go somewhere else to work... where they will value you and appreciate your work and care! All they want is sales and delivery done they don’t care about your well being or anything eithe
bad,"Anything to make a dollar off a customer . That was the culture . "
bad,Customers were not happy with our service always angry customers. When customers needed help with their merchandise not working there was ever nothing done. Managers would say for collections to take care of. We didn’t have the experience to go fix it. Drivers quit because of the way they were being treated.
bad,Aarons does not back its employees at all. My main part of my job is to call people about payments. I get cussed and threatened all the time and then customers will call in a complaint and I get in trouble. I have been promised 2 times I would get a promotion that I still have not gotten. I am 1 of 2 lowest paid people in the store and no hope for a raise as the company is already struggling. If you have any issues do not trust your upper management at all. The district manager is a back stabber and has no back bone himself
bad,Just a horrible company to work for did not pay the best for what u had to deal with u lived there if u where a manger of any kind no home life or family time
bad,It was a good store then it went down hill. But it was a job. Just managed poorly at a store level and above. There were good times and bad but you get that with every job really. Can’t go much into detail .
bad,"Just that. If you cant take customers complaing all the time about how awful Aaron's is for the customers, jobs not for you. You're encouraged to be as sneaky as possible by "
bad,"The micro-management is unreal. You'd get the same email from about 5-6 different upper-level managers. Too much nepotism also. This company creates positions for family members if you're the right ""culture"". I wasn't. No experience necessary for some of the higher-ups as long as you are not a minority and your dad or relative calls the shots. Not fair at all. Being a fishing buddy of a regional VP is also a plus. It doesn't matter that someone has 17-20 years experience in the same field as Aaron's, and the fishing buddy has 0 and comes from working at say a restaurant. The fishing buddy or the fishing buddy's relative WILL get the job or promotion."
bad,"Unbelievable performance goals of completed projects versus available projects to work on. Ok how about 10 completed pieces per day, Split between 4 techs with only 17 pieces in the pipeline. Including  pieces that need parts.. . That’s just plain silly!"
bad,Backwards philosophy. No for thinking concepts. Company is worth more worried about profits for the CEOs and upper management then taking care of the people who are actually doing the work
bad,"Your training consists of a ton of outdated videos followed by extremely easy quizes. The videos are repetitive and you will watch 5 videos on the same subject and it's mandatory to watch them. You work 10-11 hours a day constantly on your feet moving furniture, appliances, and electronics all day. In one day you'll move enough furniture for 5 households. You are NOT a manager of any kind and your job rarely I inolved sales. As a sales manager you are responsible for the showroom floor. Period! I had to rearrange the floor 4 times in 5 days because my trainer was incompetent and kept doing it wrong or the manager didn't like how it was done. I never was taught the correct way to price anything, just kept getting told I was doing it wrong. I was told 5 different ways to do one task and never did get clear on the correct way to do anything. Everyone I worked with hated their job and complained all day long about upper management. This is a hard labor job, not a sales job don't let them fool you. Do yourself a favor and look for employment elsewhere."
bad,"My department is very busy,  some time it's slow where we only work four to six hours a day,  I like my co-workers and my supervisor. Aaron is a good company to work for, no there's no free lunch"
bad,"For starters, be prepared to give up any work life balance. I am here from 9-8 most days, with longer shifts almost a certainty. I do everything in the store and I don’t get paid enough for it. Hundreds of collections calls to customers a day and field visiting their residences upon non payment (especially at night) are stressful and dangerous. I often go home sweaty and irritated. Goals sent down from management are nearly impossible to meet and they get angry when you don’t meet them - the extremely long days along with this take a physical toll on your body and mind. Management does not hesitate to change your schedule or interfere with your personal time just so it benefits them. Expectations of this company are much too high for the low pay received. I wanted to become a general manager upon starting but that is now seemingly not a possibility since promotions and rewards do not come by often. There are better options out there, especially for a college graduate like myself. Stay away from this company."
bad,"Job completely blows! No room for advancement regional managers have unrealistic goals, people put you down instead of encouraging you to do better, if you plan on applying prepare yourself from not being home all day and always being stressed, they will work you till you grow grey hairs and for the little pay, delivery drivers make more money here and have no stress or any one breathing down their necks Best thing to do is to stay away from this job at all cause!"
bad,"its all about number , we have  to collect money but if they dont have it  . we have to pick it up , but some of them really have like 1 or 2 payments i didnt feel wright to do it"
bad,This company has forgotten that the filed associates are what makes or breaks a company with its customers. Their AR department is more interested in removing tenure and taking benefits away from the field associates.
bad,"do not recommend working here. They dont care if you have a family, They schedule you for 50 hours a week. They dont care if you need a certain day off. They expect you to rearrange your life around their work schedule."
bad,"The number of items to be ""completed"" (repaired and ready to return to store) required for each tech is high based upon metrics arrived at by no logic whatsoever."
bad,"Great job for someone with no interest in a work/life balance. If you are someone who enjoys lying to customers, being micromanaged at every step, and being stressed out by pressure for not being able to reach unattainable goals, then this is the company for you."
bad,Just an awful company for both its employees and customers.  They sell mattresses with bed bugs.  They block all fire hazards.  They are in the business of really ripping off its customers and often its associates.They cater to a lower economic clientele and they take advantage of this in the worst possible way.
bad,This is one of the worst jobs ever. If you are heartless and ruthless then this is the perfect job for you. It is expected of you to spend your entire life dedicated to this job. The upper management is so out of touch and they expect everyone to kiss their behinds. You will never get a raise because it is based on the entire performance of the store. The turn over rate is extremely high because the expectations for all positions are out of this world.
bad,The Aarons in Waxahachie is not a good store to work for. They let the Sales Manager run the store not the GM. The store is really down in sales due to the way people are treated there.
bad,"I worked at the one on carriage house the manager is a whinny baby and you get micro managing not enough help as far as trait you learn stuff you don't use not a chance for moving up and !!! I don't recommend this job to anyone, great staff other than the gm"
bad,"If you have any type of life, Aarons is not the job for you. The management here does not care about your family or your needs, the only thing they care about is making money for themselves. If you do poorly in the job that you are in however, have no fear, because they will put you in a different job instead. If you do well in the job you are assigned then they will ship you to a different store with no care how it will effect you, and place the person that performs poorly in your position because they can not perform the job that is open at the other store. You will not have a family life whatsoever, so tell the family you will be able to see them for a hour or two a day on the days that you work"
bad,"I would call friends and family of customers to try to get the customers to pay."
bad,the hardest part of this job was doing something one way one day & the next day it would be wrong. I never felt confident in my ability to learn my job & do it
bad,"Terrible management , terrible planning, management doesnt care about employess, only cares about meeting thier numbers. Only thing good is the benefits and you get paid every week. no oppurtunity for advancement no matter how hard you work. You will feel unappriciated at this store"
bad,this one of the worse places i ever worked and if don't like you they find away to fire you and then get a days work out of you before the tell you that your a done.
bad,Long days with moving and setting up furniture in customers homes. Door to door collections which were at times dangerous with customers that drew weapons on you.
bad,"I am still employeed with this company till I find something better. They opened my job possition and did not tell me, someone I know saw it and told me, because I took two days off to go to my great grandmothers funeral and when I got back was wrote up for taking two days insted of one. I refused to sign the write up, and was told that my job should be more important than my kids and family. They do not care about you or anything dealing with you, all they care about is getting the most money. They are unfair and are constingly threting my job if my numbers are not what all the other stores are. They do not take in to fact that we are in a very small town. They don't care. They do not care about there customers either. The RM is just as cold as they get."
bad,"It was the worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,I worked at Aaron's for 3 years and during that time my job was threatened weekly.  I would plan a family vacation and then be told a week before leaving that if I wanted my job I shouldn't go.  I worked 6 days a week an average of 13 hours a day. There is absolutely no work life balance unless you're a Regional manager or higher. The welfare of the employees is non existent.
bad,This company will work you to death make or females you will be required to sell delivery repo merchandise- sometimes by yourself ! Good luck getting that side by side refrigerator down a flight of stairs by yourself !
bad,"If you have children or a family life, this job is not for you. The hours are long and hard. Aaron's is open seven days a week. Expect to work late nights, weekends, and holidays for meager pay, even in a managerial role. If you're young, single, and living with your parents, this may be the job for you, but get ready to work on a truck delivering heavy furniture and appliances regardless of the position you're applying for. The turnover is extremely high and nobody likes working there because the work is very stressful."
bad,"Literally the worst job you can ever have. If you work for Aarons DO NOT work in the Triad area. No system, non stop work. Barely any breaks. Management does not know how to communicate effectively. Sad to say please don't waste your time."
bad,"They can not figure out how to run the company. They constantly change what they want us to do daily. The company preached that we should have quality of life and spend more time with our families... So they cut our hours. "
bad,"All risk low rewards! Low raises yearly, sitting for long periods of time, high opportunities of bringing bed bugs or roaches to your own home with walking into invested homes of customers"
bad,I did not enjoy my time working at Aarons for a series of reasons. First of all the manager of my store was an alcoholic and arrived late to work many days and slept in the break room while we worked. There was constant inappropriate behavior from every staff member including comments deemed as harassment. They also sold broken or very poorly cared for products to people and pressured me to do the same. They never kept up on their legal paperwork and cut corners constantly. I left after working there for less than a year.
bad,"If you value your ethics and have morals do not work here, they do not care about you, only the numbers, and if you do not do what is necessary to get customers signed up your job is threatened. Don't bother telling higher management anything about what might be going on at store level if its bad because once higher management comes down on the store manager, he/she makes your life living he^%"
bad,"Typical retail environment & retail demands.  Hours are more demanding, usually requiring 6 days a week.  A lot of product returns due to being on lease & a lot of pressure to originate enough new leases to cover the returns & still grow to their standards."
bad,"We would often be asked by supervisors to do several illegal things in a day, such as running cards without authorization or entering a home with no one in it or some other circumstance."
bad,The job was demanding and stressful.  One's schedule can change at any moment based on store needs.  Long hours are to be expected.   Upper management was a joke.  The employees were more concerned with gossip than actual work.  No job productivity whatsoever.  There are MUCH better employment opportunities out here for one's consideration.
bad,"Almost 10 years with this company.  Pay is OK for General Managers.  The time away from family and the overall culture and business is horrible.  I wish this life on no one.  When the most enjoyable part of a job becomes Repossessing a 3 year old TV worth $50 because a customer missed a payment and won't answer a phone is not a way to live.  Hours for GM's is from 8:30 AM - 9:30 PM on average.  Some days are longer.  Stated days off are not real.  You are expected to be there.   A GM's day off is Sunday.  Vacation, sick, and personal days off are also not real.  If you're sick, you shouldn't be running a store.  Personal days are a joke.  I got one when my mother passed away, then got written up.  When I got smart and walked away, I left 5 weeks vacation, over 40 sick days and 18 personal days on the table. (you cant roll them over, just added up).  There is a constant stream of emails (every 10 minutes) and phone calls (every 2 hours) letting you know how awful you are doing.  We as tenured managers (me 9 years) feel like our lively-hood is on the line with degrading calls and write ups all the time.  There is weekly inventory of all items. ALL items. 1000+ pieces.  This must be done and reconciled before opening on Monday.  I'm leaving this review because I ran a top 10 store of over 100 stores for over 2 years in all tracked categories.  Sales, Customer Growth, and Renewal Percentage.  I passes all audits, ran short handed 90% of the time and took no time off.  I trained and generated 5 new General Managers for the company and was eventually transferred to another store 30"
bad,"your asked to work off the clock to be able to move up in the company. donate your time for the good of the company."
bad,"This is a miserable company to work for. The pay as a GM is decent, but the company feels that since they pay you well, that they OWN you. Your job is threatened DAILY! You get phones calls almost hourly wanting to know ""what did you do the last hour"", ""why did you do that"". Ridiculous micro management!! you can't even take lunch without calling a regional manager to find out if it's ok for you to take a break. 60 hour weeks are mandatory!! Performance is subjective. Your store can be best performing store and it is NEVER enough. Upper management tells you daily how easy it is to replace you! If you like going to work everyday wondering IF today is the day that you'll be fired, even if you are a top producer, ex. #3 out of 2000+ stores, then this is a job for you. When you are hired, tell your family you will NOT  see them much anymore, since the long work weeks are mandatory, even though they tell you it's not mandatory, you will just ""be replaced"" if you don't wrk it."
bad,"when I came to work for this company I love it! The people I work with we were doing something good, we were growing the store."
bad,DON'T DO IT. The actual company itself is wonderful. They offer benefits right away and environment is generally easy going depending on if you have a hypocritical control freak for a manager or not. You won't get paid the rate you should for the work you will do and it's never good enough.
bad,"Was employed here for 8 years. And after 8 years all I can say is this......if you have a wife/husband and or kids, DO NOT GET HIRED HERE. If you don't want your buttons pushed everyday, DO NOT WORK HERE. It will consume your life. It looks nice to be on top, but when things aren't going good, it gives you grey hair. For GM's, they will work the snot out of you if you let them. All the guys that are crooked, are all on top. BTW, I was told I was not old enough to be a regional manager by two Vice Presidents. Regardless of my #'s. So it's best off you stay away from here if all you want to do is sit inside 4 walls all day. AND STAY AWAY FROM HOMESMART!!!!!!"
bad,"if you are looking to get worked to the bone, and pulled in 10 different directions at once, and then yelled at for not completing tasks, this is for you. decent pay 50 hr work weeks. This is high stress, you have outrageous sales goals to meet in a declining market, and incredible amounts of outside marketing to be done on a daily basis. there is poor structure and anyone is replacable at any time for any reason, highest turnover rate ive ever seen. everyone hates their job. you come in a 8am and are told to make a daily to do list, then that list is basically ignored and whatever upper management sees on reports as a problem must be done. please, find another career- unless you like feeling like going home at 8-9 pm and not knowing if you will be employeed the next day or wondering if you even want to go to work."
bad,"Good customer service, patience, and persistence is a must to be successful at Aaron's. You also need to be able to adapt to change easily as things are constantly changing. The turnover rate is high because you can quickly get frustrated with ever changing policies and management."
bad,"You will be a slave to Aarrons. You will have no time for any work life balance. Period. You will be Aaron's property 24/7. Do not expect to have a life. example 10-7 Monday 12-9 Tuesday off Wednesday 9-6 Thursday"
bad,"Pros: they let their people get away with pretty much anything."
bad,"Worked 10am to 7 pm Mon-Wed, Fri-(Sat- 9am- 5pm) off Sun&Thur Poor training! All online with no direction and no time to complete it. Heavy lifting!!!"
bad,I worked at the local store for almost 3 years. Moved from driver to accounts. I do not recomment this job to anyone looking for 1. advancement. 2. structured management. 3. people you can depend on 4. caring about customers. 5. raises. 6. company that cares about YOU
bad,"We are constantly pushed to sell, sell, sell. I get it: it's our job, but half the furniture is terrible. They want to compete with retail stores, but don't want to have better quality items. Feels like we are catering to people too lazy to get a job, than people who work their butts off for a living. Hard working average people don't see any value in what we sell, not only that but for a national company with stores everywhere, you'd think we could negotiate better costs with vendors and have more competitive pricing. Even if you pay something off in the same as cash period, you're still paying way more for it than you would at other places. When sales are down, it's your fault. When people skip out on you, it's your fault. Everything is always your fault. Employees are made to feel unappreciated, and left feeling guilty for asking for days off. The business we're in is a dying one and it sucks. Working Sundays and Holidays because nobody believes in family time anymore. Higher ups are out of touch with store level activities, expects insane working hours from the GM's, and it inadvertently gets taken out on associates."
bad,"Management is a joke. We've had 5 different regional mgrs in 3 years. Each completely changes policy. The GM passes his responsibilities to others causing you to not being able to perform your job. Long hours ensure you have no family time. Pay is avg and raises are low to none. If you're single with no life and love stress, this is the place for you. They talk a great game but never deliver. 6 years in and looking desperately for something else. I'm not normally this negative, but you can do MUCH better."
bad,"I have never heard such a foul and sexually suggestive mouth on a regional manager who answered directly to the franchise owner. "
bad,"this is a job to get me by, i dont feel like we are paid enough for the hard work we do especially compared to how much people that do half the work we do get paid ."
bad,"Horrible place to work. No such thing as advancement or raises, unless your related to the higher-ups Recently discovered that the old owner was paying employees less than what was on the records, and pocketed the rest. watch out for this place."
bad,"Upper Management, Regional Managers And Above SUCK!! VERBAL ABUSE IS TOLERATED AND GIVEN ALL THE TIME BY UPPER MANAGEMENT!!!! Complain To Corporate And Watch What Happens!! Harassment By The Regional Managers!! This Is A Real Racist Company. You Will Have Much Success If You Are A White Male. All Upper Management Is The Good Ole Boy System!! There Are Very Few Minorities In Positions Of Management And Even Less Women. Everything Sounds Great Until You Are Hired. I Spent 3 1/2 Years With This Company And Ran A VERY Successful Store!! The Only Problem Was I Wasn't A White Male And I DIDN'T Find The Racist Or Sexist Jokes Funny At All And I Called Them On EVERYONE!!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES!! It Shows Daily And For Those Who Are Giving Them Good Reviews, They Are AFRAID To Loose Their JOBS!!!"
bad,"I was selected as a product specialist. I delivered all furniture to the customers ALONE. I didn't have a partner to carry refrigerators and washer/dryers up 3 flights of stairs. I had a great manager who would constantly fight for another PS, but however fell short due to budget cuts. He would help deliver products when not busy running the store himself. Corporate also believed that I could continue doing the job due to my success alone. I then made my decision to leave the company based on their belief."
bad,The company as a whole sucks. We now work on Sundays and they took some of our holidays away. They claim they are a family but yet they take time away from our own families.
bad,"Was a successful manager in another company similar to Aaron's for years. Almost all ideas for success and growth were ignored, which goes against everything i have taught my former staff. You must cold call past clients to bring in traffic, which only reminds them to never go back.  The manager Treated staff poorly and Operated in a fashion that turned the crew into avoiding said person as much as possible, was unacceptable behavior and heart breaking to see, as they should always provide the life in The store. The Store itself rarely had clients walk in each day so was often a quiet and miserable place.  Quickly left to a much better career, unfortunately outside of the industry I loved for almost 4 yrs. But Aaron's killing that love has blessed me with an even better career, so perhaps I should be thanking them."
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers, but the company required long hours and you were lucky to be able to sit down and enjoy a meal break because there wasn't really enough employees to handle customers."
bad,"If you have a family or intend on having a family, DO NOT work here. You basically live here working 10-14 he days and lack of appreciation from higher ups. Occasionally you find a good GM but anything higher, they don't care about you just themselves. I did enjoy the people I worked with at the store however. Don't believe your possible duties if you accept promotion because you will be disappointed."
bad,"Worked for Aarons for 1 year and the job it self is great but so many people get passed for promotions due to Gender and Race...which i have first hand witnessed."
bad,"Long hours, and job isn't worth the pay.  There all day with no life, and bosses don't care what lower level positions have to say."
bad,You have to have really thick skin to work for this company. GM's literally make you not want to go in to work. Lots of micromanagement and smart insulting comments.
bad,I guess it's good if you can keep it a temp job but it's stressful and you have no free time. They expect way to much with the little resources they give you.
bad,"I was not to fond of this work place was inconsistent and poorly managed had a lot of upset customers on a daily , there pricing on furniture was not reasonable at all and the store was just a mess Always ! They closed"
bad,Great pay and benefits but not the industry I'd like to be a part of any longer. The sales program and acquisition of new customers kept me going but their collection processes are something to be rethought.
bad,"A typical day at work is working with new customers,I have learn that how you approach people you will attract them to like you."
bad,Had a regional that was hard but fair and ethical. Got new regional  and he was all about himself. Didnt believe rules applied to him and he stepped on everyone he could to make himself look better. He was aligned with a cursing evil VP that wanted to scream and yell at anyone that he could. They make a perfect pair.
bad,"As a corporate entity, the money was good but the job had too many negatives, and a highly stressful atmosphere. A typical work day was disorganized, frustrating, unsafe."
bad,"Would not recommend. Franchise owned.  Owners want to do things ""their way"" only.  No open to new ideas or processes.  Cares only about the bottom line, not the employee."
bad,"If you have nothing else and this is the only place that called you, I guess do it but dont make it a career you will be sorry. It's a guy there now he been there for 20 something years and he is still a driver I think he makes 16 a hour after 20 years smh. Dont do it you are making a mistake."
bad,This company robbed me took money out of wages staff and management have no clue of what's going on. Avoid this company. They are awful to work for. Regret working here massively.
bad,"the industry is failing and this place has a dated business motto that isn't attractive to the demographic with the purchasing power. Promotions are guaranteed but with a small pay bump and a boatload of new responsibilities. this is just my personal experience, and from that I wouldn't recommend any of my loved ones to work or shop here."
bad,"Upper management has no idea of we who runs the company.  If you are middle mamagement, it's just a matter of time before you are terminated.   All they care about is the customers and  hourly associates."
bad,The company was ok at first. But seems like nobody knows exactly what their job description is. It was very unorganized. The mangers are very unprofessional.
bad,This place is a joke. It will rob your soul. You will be married to your job while your family grows old around. There is no 'work life' balance at this place.
bad,Would never work there again they rip people off didnt get my bonus after store closed there dis organized way to much work for the pay to many peolle who complian
bad,"I do not recommend this job to anyone. The area manager did not have my back and did not discuss anything with me. I also found out that sales was not my forte, and have decided to steer clear of that field."
bad,Horrible benefits. Limited commission. Small base salary. Little to no training. Small time marketing strategies. Not a good place to work.
bad,"A typical work day was walking into work, clock in and get to calling all customers who had pass due accounts. I learned how to deal with different people and their mindset about their bills. Management was kind of hard to deal with some times but sometimes it was very needed. I had some co-workers that was very lazy but I also had some hard working co-workers. the hardest part of my job was having to go and pick up items customers stopped paying for. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the required percentage at the end of the period."
bad,"The company only pays the CSR's 900 a hour to build beds, help with sales, so all the paper work run the whole floor while management gets to sit down all day and place phone calls."
bad,Decent pay and you earn commission. Easy work and pretty laid back. Understandable when you need a day off as well. There is always something to do while on the clock so you are never sitting around.
bad,"You will Typically work about 42 hours a week. Management works a required 45 hours that usually turnes into 50 plus. Because of the type of people Aarons target, you are more than likely to deal with very angry customers and people who come in with the intention to steal. As a CSR i was in trouble when i fully processed someone and he or she wasnt eligible {as if thats my fault } OR if i allowed them to receive merchandise without being fully processed.( i cant win with these people) On top of the customers being angry by default, my management had the worst customer service.. They didnt value their customers at all.. the Sales Manager is over worked and under paid and does the majority of the work."
bad,"N/a too far back,and not relevant now.I did not enjoy anything about my time there. A very bad work environment"
bad,Ever changing retail environment. Has many deal for customers.
bad,"Hectic workplace, doesnt offer raises or benefits. Did deliveries is company vehicle. Maintained and set up furniture, appliances, and electronics."
bad,Long work weeks  pays well . But no home time !  Company has  changed over the last couple years ! 6 days work weeks and 12 to 14 hrs days this is for general manager !
bad,Management was poorly run. The store was in shambles when they hired me and expected me to turn the whole thing around. The Regional Manager never did anything but drink margaritas down the road and the owner of our franchise laundered money out of our store. Last store manager was fired for embezzlement. An aboslute mess.
bad,They do not work with your family life. They allow for advancement in the company however expect you to put the company first. Do not give decent raises.
bad,No respect for employees from management even if you do what they say they change the rule and don't tell you and then yell at you for not following it.  Sales goal is unattainable and you are always at risk of bringing home bedbugs
bad,I like all associates that work with it is a family. The customers we I love them they follow me where store I go.  I have learn how to grow the store.
bad,"It's dealing with people, and the company runs specials to scrape the bottom of the barrel: no money down, $1 down, $5 down. People lie about their income, their references, their numbers, it's crazy. The sales manager just wants the sale so they don't check things like they should, and the company is loosing money giving away merchandise. They've cut our hours but working us more days: now open Sunday. It's a tough job."
bad,"company does not take care of their employees nor customers, general manager does not treat people fairly. really question how some of the people are employed"
bad,"Feel like they could work on the home work balance, or at least pay better if they are going to have you away from the family so much, overall it was a ok place to work"
bad,Aaron's will pay you as cheap as possible! This job will wear you out! You will run into customers who will talk to you like garbage and no one does anything about it!! I dedicated almost 1 yr. and a half to this job and made top sales in products and did my part to be a team player!! I the end I got fired over two other employees issues when I was attacked!!! That's the Aaron's way though!!
bad,GM at Lexington Park Md location was an outright racist towards Black enployees and Customers! Showed favoritism to Caucassion employees! Applicants beware!
bad,"I learned many things while employed at Aarons, from being able to manage an entire store to knowing that certain things should not be permitted. I personally do not believe I would ever go back to a such work place due to many things, but in other areas, other than accounting it is a great store."
bad,"I was over worked, under appreciated, management was bull, i was sent to work in a store 2 hours away TWICE for a month or longer both times with no for of compensation"
bad,Answering the phone constantly and having to speak to every single person that walks into the store was stressful and insanely hard.  Bothering people every day was a chore.
bad,It's ok place to work. you will have to make sure you have help with children if youre a single parent. This job is VERY DEMANDING.  Frequent manager changes.
bad,"The worst job I ever had, very bad management that don't care about the employees home life. Long hours Management sucked, aggressive customer service trying to get money for rentals. They don't take care of there customers as they say they do, customers had there rentals broken and promised they would fix them but never did. Very bad experience would never recommend working there or renting from them."
bad,"Poor pay unless you get promoted to GM or above, and then you put in 70 hours a week and lose your earned vacation time. Run, don't walk, away from here."
bad,Aarons was by far the hardest place to work. It was a very unhappy place to be and the management really was hard to get along with.
bad,The management does not know what the other is doing. The customers are nice and friendly but management encourages you to be mean to them and treat them like collection pieces.
bad,no encouragement on your behind all the time to say it nicely not organize at all.  was not a enjoyable job unless you fit in to thier younger group.
bad,Ok leader ship from the manager but the owner and district manger really had no idea what it was like working in the public.
bad,"i love people and getting the chance to get to know them on a personal level, by helping them choose items for their home."
bad,I quickly learned that a big part of my day to day work-life was cold calling the same list of customers references who had absolutely no interest in buying anything from Aaron's. It was the biggest part of my job & it was shamefully forceful solicitation. It was very hard to have respect for myself working for Aaron's.
bad,managament sucks they dont care about there employers and ita no team there but my coworkers were the best and i could depend on them / there ALWAYS NEW MANGERS NO ONE STAYS
bad,Aaron's is a ok company needs more work with doing better for the employees there. They have to look st some of the areas that they located in and understand the type of sales numbers that they will have. They need to work better with the employees give better benefits and pay.
bad,If you enjoy working and not seeing your kids or family take a job !!  Don’t tho k about taking a vacation between October and December it won’t happen if it does your a lucky person
bad,"I thought I would have been working for a great company, but I was not treated very well. I did more than I was supposed to. I was doing my job, my bosses job and the driver's jobs."
bad,"Poor leadership. Work life balance is poor. Turnover is very high and bonuses are unattainable. "
bad,It’s a great job if you know who to suck up to. Managers are constantly being promoted and demoted. You’re treated like your job is on the line daily when it’s not because nobody wants to work there and they are always hiring. I couldn’t ever keep delivery drivers because the pay was insulting.
bad,"a typical day at aarons was getting stuff ready for delivery, loading the truck, driving place to place then going back and cleaning everything. i learned that if you wanted to move you it was really hard. management for this company was really bad never enforced the rules. the workplace culture was ok not the best. hardest part of the job was delivery's to a third floor and dealing with management."
bad,fun at first and then it wasn't. The expectation of remembering every single SKU number on every single item is ridiculous........................................
bad,"All I have to say about this place is BUGS. There are roaches in appliances, roaches in electronics, roaches in the coffee pot used to make the complimentary coffee for customers, bed bugs in the furniture. If they took back furniture that a customer could no longer pay for, it did not matter if it was infested with bugs. They would spray it and pray for the best. Absolute worst place I have worked."
bad,After several years of service with Aaron's it became time for a change. They are a good company to start out with and if you happen to be in the right crowd it is even a great place to grow and prosper.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. Not professional or definitely be at the location I was working, management didn't seem to care about employees."
bad,"The pay is ok, but the place is poorly managed. The workload is super stressful and everybody talked bad about everybody else when they weren't in the room. Constantly had to work late with management scrambling to not offer overtime. The turnover rate is super high. They had employees engage in questionably legal procedures consistently. Also like half the staff chews tobacco in the building, spitting in garbage cans and pop bottles."
bad,"The morale between employees is horrible. Its an on-edge, stressful environment to work in and the management is seriously lacking the ability to efficiently run the store."
bad,"After being a part of this business model for a couple of years it is VERY evident that ALL of these type of ""rent to own"" places do nothing but ripoff the under privileged, under educated, and government assisted individuals. Charging four, five, six and seven times the cost, spread out over time due to these individuals self imposed or not situations should be at very least immoral let alone illegal. I left due to this."
bad,"management leave and goes as please, co workers ALWAYS calling out, not a professional work place. management LIES to customers about what they paid on payments ,"
bad,"nothing is in order when coming into this job, they don't care if you have a family problem or sick, I was lucky enough to get my wedding off. always balms employees if theres a problem even if its the temps fault. would never go back"
bad,Long hours no growth in career path and very low pay very chaotic unorganized work day and unsafe work environment training was very uninformative no structure
bad,"Started at mt moved around a lot promoted to gm after 6 months. Very long hours never enough time with family mangers don't care if you ever take time off tell you that if short handed you shouldn't take time off. I also was due for pay increase and was told that I wasn't getting it not valued as an employee for the work you do if you don't make numbers you don't get anything. Regional mangers talk down to you they preach culture and I believe they don't even know what ""culture "" is. Overall from regional mangers up not very positive to work for."
bad,traveling hours to work and back. leaving for work for at 6.30 wasn't getting home until 9 most nights and asked to be on call out every weekend
bad,"very racist/non cultured company. your job is safe if you are liked. profanity used by managers, racist comments tolerated by upper mngt"
bad,"I am one of the oldest employees at Aarons. I believe in customer service to the fullest and I feel that at the end of the day it is about how many customers I have pleased not how much money I have collected. I feel that at my store and in my regional area my general manager does not feel the same as I do about integrity and respect of human kind. I am at this location for a reason so I am learning daily what areas VICTORIA needs to improve at to be the best at customer service I can be. I love a challenge and at this company, I have learned a lot about myself. I feel that I am developing character and self awareness because I aim at being the best I can be while shinning my light in the darkness of my environment. A typical day at Aaron's is come in to work, process the customer referrals, stage deliveries, take customer payments, market outside, and do follow up calls on online request and quote inventory to inquiring customers. The hardest part of my job is staying positive when the workload is so overwhelming while we are short staffed. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing smiling faces. Seeing customer get new furniture that they thought was out of reach with their foretasted budget."
bad,"Aaron's is similar to Rent A Center as far as the target customers. A lot of time is spent trying to track down payments and get back merchandise that people aren't making payments on. I learned that the rent to own business is not a very positive atmosphere to work in. Most of the co-workers were fine, but they didn't really enjoy the job either. The hardest part of the job was going out to try to pick up merchandise from people who didn't want to pay for it or give it back. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day."
bad,"The Regional Manager of the Cincinnati Tri State Area is amazing and wants to see you reach your best potential in the organization. However,  the General Manager of the Norwood Cincinnati location is not easy to work with. She is rude to her customers and most employees. She lacks compassion for others and is not a good trainer/teacher. She is disrespectful.  Bad location to work."
bad,"Definitely not one of the best places to work. Have to put up with alot of degrading verbal abuse from customers including communicating threats, literally had an employee get shot at by a customer and the company did absolutely NOTHING to give their employee any kind of support. Management is poor with no backbone."
bad,"The company itself is not bad, its tye people they have running it. Main boss was rude and didnt care if you are sick or have a family issue. The regional manager was the same way. Benefits were trash as well.  The guy that worked with me in the truck that worked with me was the only decent thing about the job, he helped me get through it daily."
bad,I started working as a Customer Service Representative and moved up to the Customer Accounts Adviser. After that they looked for ways to get me to quit.
bad,The company has great benefits and a decent pay scale for the most part. Job security wasn't an issue but management was. The companies policies were not held to the highest standard as they said it should have been.
bad,My review of Aaron's its all about the company never about the employees as much as they say it's family based its not I know first hand as i wont get into details.
bad,This is a retail company that asks employees to put the needs of the company ahead of their associates and does not allow for any advancement positions.
bad,Honestly my direct supervisors were absolutely fantastic. everything else though. never again. i would literal rather terminally incapacitate myself than ever willing work for that company again. my loyalty to my direct supervisors is the only reason i stayed so long. after they were systematically fired one by one and it was just me I quit.
bad,"Upon doing an interview process they typically tell you just to hire you that there is career opportunities and false promises of promotions. Once they have you on the books training is very minimal after your 1st week. Management trains there employees to lie to customers about club claiming its required for extensions. Under the new leadership moral is seriously shot, conference calls seems to be more important to attend then doing real work. Management encourages negativity more than a positive work environment by gossiping to coworkers also saying off colored jokes. Management also tells employees that for new customers it is a requirement for them to setup for automatic payments just increase their overall percent of growth.  Also very long hours expected to work from 9-8pm or 9pm depending on needs of the store or RM."
bad,"The only positive is earning potential if you're in a busy location, if not then good luck.  This company has been spiraling downward for the last six years.  Numerous executive shake ups, lack of leadership, ever changing direction and now it is no longer a place I would recommend anyone work."
bad,"you work Monday through Saturday mid shift 8-10am to 7-9pm with Sunday and a day off through the week. "
bad,I worked 50+ hours a week leaving no family life. Management was unappreciative of any work anyone did. The only focus was sales most of the time they didn't care about the customer or how much we sold them or if they could afford it.
bad,Company does not care about it's employees and is unstable work environment. Upper management only concerned with them making money and does not communicate well with lower management.
bad,"Aarons was only ok because of the people I worked with, I left there with some lifelong friends. The pay sucked pretty bad and I only stayed there that long because I couldn't find nothing better"
bad,"The work ranges from easy to unbearable at times."
bad,"Zero home /work balance. Very difficult to have any security "
bad,you're better off going to work at a warehouse or somewhere. 11 an hour as a delivery diver. And it's ton of junk  to put up with. No chance for advancement expect more out of you than what you're paid for
bad,"There arent enough positions available at Aaron's so there are too many responsibilities for each associate. The pay is horrible. As a customer service representative you start at 10/ hr plus commission. The commission structure is poor which leads to the over worked employees to be under paid for the merchandise that they sale. The management in my store is ""okay""? Other stores in our region are a nightmare..."
bad,"The culture of this buisnes went to great to terrible when they went public. They ousted the Ceo.in  terrible way about 6 yrs ago after that the company has fallen apart. They have gone in different directions but nothing has worked they called it getting back to  basics. The problem is they have never changed with the times and there creativity has been lost, when the competition stepped it up they have been in the toilet ever since. It's to bad a once a great  company that got  greedy."
bad,This wouldn't be the last place  I wouldn't recommend anyone to work. The regional managers and general managers doesn't care about your outside life unless your dying. Then also some general managers can be easy going then there are the ones who overwhelm their employees and stress them out majorly.
bad,"Management has no idea what they are doing. Rude and disrespectful. All they care is about getting the money. GM is lazy and loud. Everyone does whatever they want to do. If you want to get a promotion be prepared to get more respinsibility but no pay raise plus you have to kiss everyone's behind especially RM's. You work from Sun out until Sun in, don't have time to spend with your family and you will never please no body."
bad,Certain stores are poorly managed and there is a total lack of respect for the non-management associates and is not worth he headache that comes with it
bad,"This company not only lies to the customers but to the store employees as well! If your unlucky enough to work in a smaller store you can never reach the goals or pay raises they tell you that you will reach if you just follow their progress. You also should not work for.this company if you have any family or hobbies that you want to spend time with! This place expects you to make Aaron's your life and everything even your family and health come second! As for customers,  they sell them second rate merchandise at named brand prices and then when you add in fees you pay more then triple.  Every store that I've seen has had issues with either bedbugs, roaches or flees and sometimes more then one at a time! Even with these issues /infestations they won't stop selling contaminated merchandise. They just hope you don't notice or they can convince you it was caused by something else!"
bad,Basically I work to hard for the company but my pay doesn't reflect that. I do enjoy some of the workers but a lot of them quit after awhile. I also enjoy the customers because they're real down to earth people.
bad,"Never have i worked for a company that always talked behind your back and aren't afraid to transfer you for no reason. alway had to say something about not doing your job correctly or your to nice. Never give people the benefit of a doubt. always had to clean bed bugs, I'm surprised i didn't get any. seriously upset with the company and how they actually do business with people. never paid enough to those who were there the longest. 2 years of exp and they were still getting paid minimum wage and i came on with 2.5$ dollars and hour. ridiculous."
bad,I did enjoy SOME of the people I worked with but I was very glad that I left when I did. way to much drama. No motivation from management
bad,The management only care about themselves.. Do not care about your family or you as an employee of Aaron's. All they care about is the product going out and most of the time do not care about the customers
bad,"Great people to work with but the company is stuck in the dark ages with regards to work/life balance. Also the location I worked at was an old Kroger building, and that was less than ideal."
bad,I was management at this company and there is no culture the employees talked to management anyway they wanted to but management was disciplined if they corrected. Management was made to work thru lunches alot of time and have unreasonable goals
bad,"I worked there as a ""product tech"" for several years and most of the days we weren't allowed time to take a lunch due to over scheduling the deliveries."
bad,"The company has a standard that if you enter one store it should be the same as any other store. This is not true. They also penalize their employees if the customer doesn't pay their payment every month. They write the employees up in the accounts department every time that customers don't pay by the 8th and the 22nd of every month. This company operates like the mafia. Charging double the price for merchandise and harassing you and your references by calling and going to their house until you pay your account. There is a disregard for their employees but they expect them to give up time with their families for little compensation and no job security because they are an at will employer that can fire you for any reason at anytime, with or without notice. They should pay their employees more for the amount of abuse this company dishes out and in the end will fire you for no reason at all. And then will try not to pay the unemployment benefits stating reasons untrue against you."
bad,"Laid back atmosphere. Base pay plus commission. Management was poorly executed, co-workers were descent. Training was very thorough. Scheduling was not a good life/work balance. 60 hours a week and never have two days off in a row/"
bad,"Company works managers to death. Too much inventory and manager cannot control. If the warehouse ordered too much product, you get product forced shipped to you whether you like it or not."
bad,"We have to work 50+ hours six days a week. The NOLA region is messed up because the regional manager is racist, rude and very disrespectful to his employees. He was reported several times but no action was taken against him because his dad is his immediate supervisor."
bad,I feel that the rate this company says it all. Not to much more to say about this.
bad,"Retail sales. Decent Company, but can be dirty work at times."
bad,No comment. Got fired on something that felt bogus and set up
bad,"Bypass this company you'll be much happier. A lot of broken promises long hours not flexible with the schedule. no training, realistic goals are not attainable by anyone working for the company"
bad,"They do not care about the employees, they only care about the customers.  I was never treated like a person.  they lied to you all the time.  they did not pay on sales goals."
bad,Aaron's has changed from caring about the employees to not caring at all they are strictly about getting there money they dont care about the relationship you have with their guest it would not surprise me if they are sold next year my guess that is what is going to happen with all the changes made so far it follows suit for a company about to sell off its assets
bad,"Management is extremely bad. Hostile work environments are the norm and anyone that has any type of authority is allowed to get away with constant absentees and write-ups with zero consequences. Aaron's is supposed to have a zero tolerance for retaliation against an employee who goes to management with any type of concern ""in good faith"" and that, too, is not enforced or eve true."
bad,"The chap who interviewed me is the boss brother, he was an addict and was caught stealing to feed his habit. Apart from that it was a good job. Very encouraging"
bad,Bad culture not enough pay Long hours drive commute to far bad management . No love for their employees at all. No time off. It’s okay but no chance of advancement
bad,I was offered a Collection Manager Postion. I was not train property The manager at that time was a female whom had injured herself on the job an I  started training with her only 2 weeks before the company replaced her . So my training came to a crashing stop . Once she was released of her duties . That company location came crashing down fast . The store was in a hot mess. We gain another manager whom thought he was the big bad wolf. Within the first 30 days the store started loosing employees. After 2 months under this new manager I got written up 4 times for unnecessary bull  I wasnt aware of .So one week before Xmas I went home for a family emergency once I return to Utah I returned my keys to the store with a note . Once I did that movement I felt so much better an less stress.
bad,"Best part about the job was driving the delivery truck away. Management was vulgar and sexual harassment seemed to be part of their usual day. The call team would harass clients, the sales team was very lazy, the whole team was very uncoordinated"
bad,"revamp management"
bad,"Hard work, low pay, no raises, no appreciation, no advancement. Delivery drivers are treated like beasts of burden. Slaves on plantations were treated better. Heaven help you if you are 40 yrs old or older. Age discrimination is rampant there."
bad,"Hours and salary not comparable, and advance opportunities are minimal if not nonexistent. The culture of company is not family friendly to those on the front lines."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Plus if you hate to move or reassemble and disassemble furniture, this is not the job for you. They want to cross train you, but not pay you for what you're worth after you've learned a new position. Isn't that just horrible? Store hrs 9-7pm guess what that means 8-8 for you 12plus hrs with a 30 min lunch and they expect you to walk right into work the next day refreshed and ready to go for another 12 plus hour shift. The expectations for lower level management was just unrealistic and by lower level management I mean anyone who's not corporate."
bad,The business is corporate now and the changes that come with that are bogus. Less hours for more work.  Less help and more work.  Not compensated fairly.  High expectations for a not very professional environment and poor training.  Little to no training on the job.  It may be just the location I'm in but it's not a quality of life job when my hours are cut and I still have the high expectations to complete every task.
bad,"Was interviewed and hired to become the store's sales manager. The sales manager at that time didn't want to step over to Customer Accounts. Said I'd take a swing at it if they got me into the sales manager position when it became available. They went through 3 different sales managers while I was there, never was offered the position again since my date of hire. Was never able to make true judgement calls for the accounts department, was always told by the store manager (jokingly, or at least attempting to joke) that ""You can't make that call, you're sales... not accounts, you're just learning."" The numbers at the store didn't improve as the regional manager had hoped and I was held responsible, even though I wasn't allowed to make decisions, or when I did there was no follow through from the GM. Once the GM left, numbers improved fairly quickly, so I'm not just blowing smoke. I had left the company by that time, never got the position I was hired for and poor management. Aside from that, not too horrible of a job, not the best either."
bad,They dont put their employees first just there pockets. They overall rate is number one ahead of Wal-Mart. They push you to lie to customers to collect payment to achieve monthly bonuses.
bad,"Terrible scheduling, always short handed, good benefits in terms of insurance etc, Long hours and Aarons doesnt pay enough to own one's life. Its an ok starter or in between job but way too much work and hassle for so little pay."
bad,"It's my belief that the current culture, at the corporate level, is interested more in the board of trustee's than their customers. It use to be very customer oriented. Store management does their best."
bad,The customer service advisor position is okay you stay in the store running the floor. the product tech are not paid enough for the amount of labor put in. The other position such as MT or manager great pay and position for this company.
bad,"There is ZERO balance in work to life. You live there, 5 days a week, split days off. There is no way you can schedule a life outside of this company. Turnover is very high. I guess if you like being cussed out by someone who doesn't want to pay their lease payment, or, won't even answer the phone in most cases, this maybe perfect for you. They promote you with no pay increase using LAST years end of quarter numbers, which had nothing to do with what was accomplished on my part. Horrible upper management that are difficult to get along with."
bad,"Typical day at work for a sales manager involves marketing door to door for multiple hours coming back to the store, organizing the back room, cleaning the whole store, bringing out couches and building bedroom sets all alone, track the sales, plan events with a $50 budget to bring in customers 2-4 times a month. There is very little funding to support with customer growth and limited resources to be successful. Management was terrible and treated the employees like garbage blaming them that Canadian stores are not growing. In store there are too many bosses and everyone clashes and steals duties from others. Upper management was gunning for certain employees to be fired and announced it to a select few employees which started a lot of drama in the workplace and it was just overall a toxic environment."
bad,I feel like I wasted a year of my life. Benefits aren't horrible but you don't make alotnof money as it is. Overall aarons is a good beginning your life spot. But to make it your career would be silly. Hard work pays off lazy work doesn't.
bad,"Fun work environment minus hypocrisy amongst management. A lot of manual labor as a CSR/CST. Never a dull moment when working with the right people. Management sets unrealistic expectations of all staff, and sets goals above what is achievable. Some days it feels as if management sets you up for failure."
bad,"Medical benefits were great. Pay was not worth the work that was put in. On your feet the entire day, stressful quotas to meet and not getting paid adequately. You need another full time job to compensate."
bad,"Co-workers were awesome, general manager was not to great, he liked to micro manage only a few of us and the others that didnt do their job he never said anything, customers did not like him they would rather deal with me and that would make him very angry, learned alot on my own my manager or regional manager never took time to  teach me anything, hardest part of the job is if you have a family get ready not to see them or have a social life 9AM- 9PM monday thru friday and 730am to 5pm saturday."
bad,"Working in the sales and leasing industry wasn't easy. I don't believe Aaron's believed in what was best for the customer. As the sales manager i controlled the sales floor, sales and marketing. I believe i wasn't  dealt the tools i needed to be the best sales manager from upper management."
bad,"It's just that...Unless you have family/friends in another department or a senior manager with pull to vouch for you in your growth at the company, do not work here. Hard working employees often go unrewarded. The level of expectations to work your way up are absurd unless you have the aforementioned connections within. The pay is not competitive and you are treated as just another number. Minimal training or learning opportunities available to those that want to progress. Minimal effort to provide solutions to major problems at the store level. The ""Boys Club"" mentality reigns supreme at Aaron's."
bad,"This is one of those jobs where most people tell you they work just to pay the bills. You are the second lowest on the hierarchy. It's a sales position but you also process paperwork, file papers, prep merchandise for delivery (move whatever you sell to the warehouse for drivers to load the truck) and whatever any of your managers do not want to do. You typically work 45 hours a week. The benefits are nice but that's about it."
bad,You stage the merchandise for deliveries.  Fill all and any holes that may be on the sales floor.  Clean all products that are returned.  You have no set time to get off and you now have no life.
bad,we like to satisfy our customer and make sure their order is delivery on time and in good condition and also we love to install and haul away and unused equipment our client not in use of
bad,"Aaron's is difficult to work for, The manager at the Waterville location is very incompetent. He is a nice guy, but doesn't know anything about running a store of this magnitude (or what used to be a 1200 customer store). The store needs to get their junk together and team up or it will sink. Customers are walking due to new management changes. The best part was driving to different parts of the state all day. The worst, not knowing what time you will be home every night."
bad,This was the worst job I ever had. This job leaves very little time to have a life outside of work.
bad,This company is not a career move. The company doesn't really care about their employees. Just as long their merchandise is deliver and they are making money. They are not concern about do their employees have families.
bad,"I worked good hours here that were always the same, worked with great people that were very knowledgeable about the company."
bad,"I was responsible for the sales side of things, as well as the account management side.  The turnover in that type of retail industry was very high.  There were long hard hours, with schedules that constantly changed without any notice.  I did enjoy working with the customers in helping them chose what best fits their needs, and did look forward to a long lasting business relationship.  But like any other lease to own business, explaining the payment side of things was tough.  And having to exercise the procedures for non paying customers wasn't the greatest at times."
bad,This has been the worst  company I have ever work for. There is no place for advancement
bad,"At Aaron's Sales and Lease every day was a different day. Would love to have that kind of career one day but wit better pay.Enjoyed working with people that I worked with.The hardest part of the job was collecting, calling customers and asking them to make a payment or return merchandise."
bad,Low pay. Heavy lifting on top of collecting money from drug dealers and cons. GM always puts staff down and calls us names. Barely can take any break due to how busy you are put to work. 8a.m to 9pm 3 nights a week no family time.No respect at all.
bad,"I really enjoy the job and the people I work with. The pay is very low and you work from 9 to 7 every day. The management is horrible, all they do is sit around and do nothing while harassing the employees."
bad,"The stores follow the policies they feel like following. "
bad,Working as a Product Technician / Delivery Driver was decent for a while; the work can get hard but time goes by pretty fast a lot of the time. I didnt mind my job but after 5 months the store I was working at was in need of a sales person and they felt like I was the right fit for the job even though I explicitly explained that I wasnt interested in working that position. So my hours were cut to one day a week in an attempt to force me into a different position. This is just one of many poor management techniques  used here.
bad,Selling people on a product that value was minimal at best for triple the money. Working with the community was rewarding. No regional support and opportunities for advancement weren’t based on performance but on personal relationships.
bad,"Management is unfair, bias and untrustworthy. Stressful environment. Have to watch your back because they will stab you in it. Unsafe at all times. Management has their employees and customers picked. Who they want to deal with"
bad,I would not recommend this as a career path. Its stressful and the work life balance is none existent . The hours are long and days off are hard to come by as a General Manager
bad,"If you treat your employees with respect they will be loyal and work for you. This company will struggle with how they treat their employees, causing their turnover to remain at a higher level."
bad,Employees feel like just another pawn piece on a chess board. Ready to be sacrificed at the hands of management. I don’t recommend getting a job here.
bad,"This store is disgusting! They take back merchandise from ppl who have bugs, which ends up in the store. For an accounts advisor, there is no work-life balance. You're working 45 hours per week which is basically 10-12 hour days of collection calls and going to people's homes. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone unless it's your only option"
bad,"Seriously, you will live there and your coworkers are your new family. Don't expect ""commission"" for sales because there are always more flaming hoops. You may get a ""good job"", quickly followed by ""do better"". Also, get familiar with trashing your good clothes and hope you start at a pay rate that just barely keeps you coming back."
bad,"Long hour, impossible goals, way to many policy changes, lazy management, no social life, worst pay. Management care about them selves more the employees and put in dangerous situations going to people home after dark."
bad,"Loaded and delivered furniture and appliances, cleaned and organized warehouse and showroom. Also made field visits for delinquent accounts."
bad,Didn't like the training program everyone worries about themselves company micromanage too much there is no freedom of thinking or doing what is right I didn't like it
bad,"The GM at the Jackson, TN location is awful. She encourages a work environment of gossip and juvenile antics. She will secretly take pictures of employees and go around the office making fun of them. Also, as soon as anyone leaves the room she is talking about them. She is awful. She also makes us record peoples card #'s and run them of they don't pay."
bad,You will do the work of multiple people but you won't be paid well. Yes you get medical benefits but the plan won't cover much. Company has a very high turnover rate.
bad,"Heavy favoritism. Unrealistic goals. If you're in with the manager and regional manager, you never get in trouble. Otherwise,  there's always a problem."
bad,"The pressure for sales generate stress throughout the work team, plus the people who are in charge of the management do not have the capacity to handle employees."
bad,"I was a delivery driver at Aaron's for almost 5 years. The first thing to know as a store level employee is that store level management plays a major role in how well your day goes. You're going to be traveling and heavy lifting every day. You'll do it in the heat, in the cold, in the rain, in the snow, in the dark, etc.. You'll deal with filthy and roach/bed bug infested houses on a fairly regular basis. You should also be prepared to clean filthy items that you have to return from these homes. You'll also work in the warehouse and on the showroom floor. You'll help the accounts department with field visiting, collecting, and doing returns if they are unable or just don't feel like doing it themselves. This is where the aforementioned comment about store level management comes in. The managers you have make all the difference in whether you clock out at 7PM with everything finished or if you're 30 miles away from the store delivering a refrigerator at 9PM because someone overbooked the schedule and made promises that YOU have to fulfill. The money to deal with these things isn't great either. After all those years, I only made $11.50/hour. Your raises are not entirely dependant on your individual performance either. If the store is doing poorly, your raises and bonuses will also be poor regardless of how hard you work personally. All in all, this job can be decent with good management and terrible with bad management, but it's not somewhere I would recommend staying if you can find something better. One last thing to add, this job takes place anywhere between 8AM and 9PM or"
bad,"A typical day at Aarons would be to set up strategy meetings for the sales and collection sides of the business. At Aarons, I would conduct audible huddles throughout the day to redirect the teams focus to areas that may not have been previously prioritized. I would set up a task list that was to be completed for each employee by the end of the day and then follow up to ensure these tasks have been completed."
bad,"unrealistic sales goals, failure to pay correct commission on cash sales reached, refused to promote within, never willing to accept time off requests many times denied for upper management vacations."
bad,"When I started it was fun but then I relocated and and it definitely wasn’t what I signed up for. It’s long hours less pay and I am a single mother so I hardly have time to spend with my children. Not only do I not have time but if there is an emergency I can’t take off if there isn’t any sick days there is basically no understanding in management. My final straw with working here is they now will require us to work on Sundays which, when I started there was no Sundays and I’m the Sales Manager and have to dedicate all my time at this company and it’s stressful and draining ."
bad,"Asked to do the work of several people’s worth. Hired to deliver merchandise and the job became maintaining merchandise and cleaning FILTHY furniture for customers with no added pay and no tips. Raise was based on going above and beyond for more sales even when not in sales position. "
bad,"The company started off with a good strategy, but the fall of the market in 2008 caused the company to go under.  Only the residential furniture leasing side survived."
bad,"I would get to work on average at 8:30a.m. and would get off around 8p.m.  Out of all the work and hours i put in, no appreciation was given.  I don't recommend this job on anyone."
bad,"I've worked for Aaron's in 3 different stores and they were all the same. Nothing changed. Aaron's is and will always be short staffed. Get ready to work long, stressful hours. Say bye-bye to your family time and get ready to pick up others slack due to always being short staffed. Aaron's doesn't care about you at all! All they care about is their numbers and business to the point that they don't care if you stay or not they'll just hire somebody else. Good Luck!"
bad,Experience at Aarons started off great but management of individual stores that i worked in were cut throat and terrible. Corporate office clearly cared about their workers and the customers but the ppl that put in place in management were dirty.
bad,"For those that do not want to work retail hours this may not be the job for you. For those in retail, Aaron's is closed on Sunday, closes early on Saturdays, and latest hours on the week day are 9p."
bad,"This is a typical ""what have you done for me today?"" company."
bad,"the job at aarons i had was a product technician, made $10 an hour, moved furniture and appliances, repaired furniture and appliances, the worst part of the job was the house we went into, they were often very dirty."
bad,"The job was actually decent. i loved the job. they put pressure on you to get sales, but that was manageable. every job is going to have pressure. but the manager will literally yell at you and cuss you out, in a non professional way. also if you're a girl, GOODLUCK! just watch what aaron's you get the job at pretty much. there's no doubt if there was a new manager that knew how to treat people i would go back."
bad,"I loved everyone to work with, but as a sales manager I found the workload to be skewed to much away from sales.  Having only 1 other salesperson in the store made it difficult with the heavy turnover rate.  I had 7 different people in that position in 2 years.  Also having to order, follow up, and review all repair orders for furniture, appliances, and electronics took up huge amounts of time and pulled me away about 8 hours a week (1 full day).  When product techs were sick it was my responsibility to go out on deliveries that day, as a result on those days I was not able to chase sales goals either.  The focus shifted to much from sales to other things and seemed to hamper my ability to do my actual job."
bad,The job sucked. The worst team of staff and so called delivery partner I've ever worked with. Only thing was good was pay and benefits that came along with the job. Everything else sucked and I would never work there again.
bad,"A fun job, but a lot of heavy lifting and constant busy work. Late hours and little time for family. Commission was good when the whole store hit requirements but would often fail."
bad,It was a nice place to work but now that there is new management not so much. If you need a job you are gonna get 40 hrs week and has benefits but they are not that good.
bad,"Good paying job but it's difficult to come up if you do not meet company standards, takes away from having a social life except for one day a week."
bad,I worked at the BG location and the store employees were wonderful however the Regional Manager for our area is another story. He would intentionally not speak to me or have someone else come and give me feedback. I think he must be intimidated by me or my work ethic and trying to grow the business. I had to leave but since my departure it seems things haven't changed and I don't imagine they will til he is replaced. I would totally work there again in a heartbeat if he was no longer in this position.
bad,Overall Aaron's is a good company. If you are at a productive store with good management it can be a fun experience. My co-workers are fun to work with. There can be some late nights if your store revenue is behind.
bad,"Aaron's' seems like an idea company from the outside to throughout the interview process. I quickly find out that it was nothing like that when I begin my employment. I have a college degree and ample military experience. I probably could run circles around my management. I felt unappreciated and overworked. My home life was affected by the long exhausting hours and never getting off on time. Every time I would bring up and issue to management, they laughed off my issues such as pay or getting off at a reasonable time. Working as a PT was a very rewarding job, but it oftentimes became very stressful due to mismanagement of time and constant overloading the delivery books. Product technicians are underpaid and not appreciated.  My management especially my general manager didn't really seem to care about my personal life or my advancement within the company. When I do not feel appreciated or there is room for advancement that when I have to make a conscious decision to do what is best for me because my company is not looking out for my well being. I felt like I was force to move on. I could not deal with the divisive atmosphere. There was constant bickering and arguing between associates. My management seem to never handle any type of confrontation with head on clarity and a solid plan. I honestly feel sorry for people that deal with Aaron's workplace drama and cannot or believe there are other options in their career."
bad,The tasks assigned far exceed the amount of work hours in the day.  The employees are set up to fail if a manager needs someone to blame.
bad,It is fun to work with the employees at the store. However upper management has no solid direction. Each member of upper management gave different directions of what to do with the store and they barely communicated the idea to each other. Instead made store associates do the same job over and over again.
bad,A typical day see what is scheduled for delivery and/or return pull load and deliver.  Can be a little un-organized.  Good people to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the work load many times can be too much not allowing one to get off on time so you almost cannot plan after work activities.  Most enjoyable part is meeting people and learning how to get around different areas
bad,the company did take care o the employes but customers had several issues it goes from not paying their bills to threatening us sometimes
bad,"After 13 years of service and  doing everything that  was asked of me,there was still no advancements.I had worked  in 10 different locations and as always no one had been trained I had to  start all over .The store would be fixed and of course  the regional was the only person  to  get  any credit for  your  hard  work. The regional staff are all over paid  and in most cases half  the store's make no profit. They start most associates at 9.00 hrly.,if they  can  get away  with it and tell manager trainees to stay  for  a year and earn a career, yea wright ."
bad,"Overall Aarons is agreat jobs.Ilike the type of work i do , imjust not pleased with the hassling management. My coworkers are excellent. The best part of my day would be out the store, delivering  merchandise."
bad,"Work 6 days a week, sometimes 7 if you cared enough and didn't want to be put on blast in front of your peers, demand on growth is ridiculous, so that means selling to people you didn't want to, no lunch breaks as a GM, which was cool because I was on a diet anyway, don't bring up your day off, it will start WW III, bad mouthing behind backs all the time..Upper management sucks BIG TIME!!!"
bad,"if you work in one of the top stores im sure life is a little better, however hours are terrible. not good for people with families."
bad,"If you are a woman, then you'll love Aaron's. I'm a combat veteran of the United States Army. I worked for Aaron's in Manchester tn for about 5 months. I found a better employment opportunity, and put my written two week notice in. I had surgery on my mouth this week and had to call out ONCE. I used ONE SICK DAY. I was then told by my manager to not come back. The management in this store is absolutely horrible, and if you want to work at Aaron's... Don't work for Manchester tn Aaron's. Unless you're a woman or a minority, then you'll love it. They have NO RESPECT for veterans, and I will never do business with such a company ever again."
bad,Aaron's has really good benefits which makes up for the pay not being extremely competitive. The management at the National Support Center is severely lacking. There is no consistency in scheduling and you have to fight to use your earned vacation time.
bad,"No integrity."
bad,It was a struggle to maintain a balance between your morals and beliefs and the tactics that Aarons used to collect payments and maintain customers accounts. The longer that you worked there the more of the sneaky underhanded techniques you could see implemented into day to day interactions with the public
bad,Set up the show room floor. Take payments and sale appliances and furniture.
bad,The hardest part of the job was management he was unprofessional and it made me uncomfortable.
bad,"The work itself isn't really that bad.  Much depends upon the manager that you get.  I would expect that most managers attempt break your spirit more so than motivate you to good results.  To an educated person, ""the pathway"", is a brain-washing attempt and should be called ""business for dumbies."" Nothing is open to interpretation. There is only one way to do everything and it doesn't matter how talented that you are. The pay is lower than average even for industry, unless you are a GM. People's tenure in this org seems to depend more upon there ability to take abuse, disrespect, and micro-management to a ridiculous degree.  This is why they can't retain good talent.  When customer count declines, The GM stopped closing out items when they were returned to the store and waited until right before they charged off to put them back into inventory. This is very dishonest. This affects the bonuses paid and ""apparent"" performance of Nons team. So, don't expect your bonuses, unless you are in sales. They will find a way to short you on pay every way possible. And pay is 2 times per month, NOT EVERY 2 WEEKS! Meaning you get 24 checks per year, not 26 if you were paid every 2 weeks. If you are on salary, expect to be worked 50+ per wk and driving to multiple locations with your own vehicle and gas. You can expect about the same from this industry as that of fast food, only that the management is much less professional and as IMMORAL as I have EVER seen!!! If you have any ethics or morals, you need not apply!!"
bad,"A typical day for each department is different"
bad,Hard to advance to a general position. Long hours with little pay.
bad,"If you working 16 hour days for little pay and thankless work, then this is the place for you!  Management was unsupportive and was just concerned that you ""made your numbers"" so they can get their bonuses."
bad,"Typical day consists of any jobs management wants done, even if they are not your duties."
bad,"The manager in trainee who goes on the field to make contact with customers who are late on his payment does it at his own risk. No real support from the management in the store. It seems like when the customer complain, the General Manager will give him a green light. When customer physically threaten an employee, the company doesn't have legal action to protect his employee."
bad,a typical day at work is come in @8am quick team meeting reviewing yesterdays numbers and todays goals and deliveries count on a average day about 6-7 on a hectic day around 10-12.
bad,A very unstable work environment.Long work hours require no interaction with family.
bad,Was with the company for almost six years. Only got one raise. Moved up 3 times still no pay raise. They bring in other employees at more money starting Im just glad Im gone .
bad,"The atmosphere is very fast paced, so if your not into ""running around the showroom"" 24/7 this place isn't for you. They seem to always be changing hands in the management department, so right when you get used to one manager, they turn around and switch them out with a new one. and the process starts all over again. Basically, to put it bluntly, its a cutthroat business so it may not be fit for many people."
bad,"Upper management (regional managers and above) don't care about you. If you don't produce their sales numbers (which are astronomically high and literally impossible to reach) then you will be chastised."
bad,"The company is so inconsistent in it's policies, work environment can be stressful. And now that they have an attendance point policy that have been placed on everyone including those that did not have an attendance issue. This policy is hard for parents with little children"
bad,The people are relaxed... Maybe too relaxed. I like things to be done how a company wants and it seems not everyone that works here feels the same. It can be frustrating to try to do things the right way when everyone else doesn't take it seriously.
bad,"Things change constantly they only care about you if your are making money you are just a number to them they don’t care about your feelings, Health nothing"
bad,"You will work and work and not get paid what you should be getting paid. Like 10hr this was 5 years ago pay, When I went to reapply 5 years later it is still 10 hr."
bad,"There are many reasons to have left Aaron's, but the most important reason is that there are no possibilities for quick career advancement and the pay scale really isn't worth the hassle of doing everyone's job and still your own."
bad,Aaron's is a decent place to work but they don't pay enough the hours are bad and they don't give raises and you'll be making the same thing three years down the road
bad,wanting to work for a company that appreciates and takes care of the're dedicated long tenured employees. also that gives pay raises for entering each and all management positions.
bad,"Long work days to 9:00 p.m. Field visiting customers at home came uncomfortable to do. Pay is low, never have Saturday's off. Rude customers tha gets angry when trying to contact them."
bad,"Decent work environment but some lack of communication and organization. Theres not much room for advancement because positions are difficult to fill. Benefits are pretty decent but the pay for certain jobs is, in my opinion, under what it should be. Sick time and vacation time was recently changed and kind of confusing. Overall it's a decent place to work, but I'm looking to advance my career."
bad,"Since was owned by the owner he would come in trying to explain how to run business, even though he had on management experience. he would get upset when I would discipline employees. then would change his rules to comprise to help those that, would try to discipline."
bad,"You have to be willing to out in 12+ hrs a day, 6 days a week for this job. You can make decent cash depending on your location. Upper management will tell you what you want to hear, but do the opposite when it becomes time to deliver."
bad,"A typical day at work was going in, going through the mail, entering in payables and payroll. The management was father who was in the office, and a son who worked in the back."
bad,"I hope that all Aaron's facilities are not as ours is.  We have poor leadership, the rules change on a daily basis, and there is no accountability from the powers that be.  The blame is constantly shifted away from the one person that creates the uncertainty, and deserves the blame."
bad,"If you have enough commen sense to realise how they and every other rent to own business works them you end up feeling like your a personified con artist. You deal with mostly rude and disgusting people daily, go inside filthy houses to repo items they can't afford or they don't understand the pay agreement. Pay is very low considering the different stuff you deal with on a daily basis. The only good that came from this job is that I learned to never go through similar type companies because how much people get ripped off without even realizing it."
bad,"Be ready to work long days for being under paid, you may not always get a lunch break and they will ask you to work your lunch and off the clock,  and they don’t care how late you have to stay out ."
bad,Sunup to sundown is the life of  a product tech here. Imagine you having to move a whole house or apartment up four flights with only a hand truck and your partner's back. That's if you had extra hands that day. Now  doesn't that sound like fun.
bad,I have children and never got to see them. I also did well more than my job and did not get paid for it. I do not see this being a great job but it did pay the bills.
bad,"Typical boring day, business was slow, I learned how to put together some furniture, management was horrible, I enjoyed nothing at all. Worst place I ever worked at."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend any female work here. I was told by the GM that he didn’t want another female sales manager after the last, and when I told him that was unfair he stated that most stores hire all males anyway. The store has bed bugs and roaches roaming around. The managers are sexiest,  incompetent, and very rude. To many chiefs and not enough Indians work here! The store is very unorganized and filthy! They pickup and return merchandise without cleaning it at all and continue to go right ahead and let the next customer buy the item."
bad,"I enjoyed learning how to do collections online, phone calls, and customer relations. "
bad,"Store Manager/General Manager Position the hours are extremely long 8am to atleast 9pm on a good night, the pay is decent until you factor in the extreme hours"
bad,"this is truly not a family person;s job. it keeps you out of the home "
bad,"Sad to say, this job takes the cake of being one of the worst jobs in history. They overcharged their fellow customers that they claim ""they care for."" Resold used furniture for the same prices of brand new furniture."
bad,I have never worked for a company where no one in corporate management positions are held accountable. There is a huge lack of leadership within in this company.
bad,"Work days started very and ended very late. the pay is okay,if you never want to eat dinner with your faimly or be able to attend any kind of school event"
bad,"Aaron's has a great idea for a business in theory, but the goals set by upper management are severely unrealistic.  Any job position at this company is extremely stressful.  Even though they have amazing benefits, you are still not fairly compensated monetarily for the amount of effort that is required."
bad,"Poor management. Poor pay for the work you do. They have a rule if you damage any merchandise or customer property, you have to pay for it which is ridiculous."
bad,As an Account Manager my jobs was to call clients that were past do on their accounts. In some cases I had to go retrieve the items from their homes and return them to the store.
bad,"If you don't know, Aaron's prides themselves on being an affordable way for people to get furniture and appliances that are normally out of their budget. What they don't tell you is how badly they screw people out of their money because of the ridiculous interest rates. They also make you work every position in the store regardless of what your actual job is and they only pay you for one of those positions. I personally was the Customer Accounts Manager, recently promoted from Manager Trainee and I did not receive a raise for my promotion, I did receive a lot more responsibilities and assignments, and I did quit because of this. I was doing deliveries, answering phones, making phone calls, closing sales, opening and closing the store, and keeping the store clean all for $10/hr with a bachelors degree. Oh, and did I mention I was working 50 hours every week?"
bad,"Ok work environment. not that much challenge. I enjoyed working serving the customers, and assisted them on their selections. Caring for my customers were my # 1 priority."
bad,"its a decent job, but if you have a manager on you 24/7 about time and schedule, then you most likely wont enjoy the job. its very stressful, and no time for yourself"
bad,"Business Closed  Sept 2016 "
bad,too much behind the scenes things going on all the time.  not enough pay for the amount of work you had to do.  going into bad neigborhoods to collect
bad,Not very family oriented. Its hard to balance out work life and family life because they never want you to leave. Not a very organized place to be working at.
bad,"Extreme hard worker, fast pase, or slow. Go getter. People person, fast learners great hand skills  team leader I was hurt at Aaron's but I'm ready to get back at it I'm a great team worker"
bad,"Very unfavorable with this company, I had a great experience early on in my employment. I think with the turnover and overhaul of company goals and strategies associates are left in the dark on what to accomplish. The culture is non existence and with continued changes its hard to see long term sustainability."
bad,the hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant flux of products and maintaining the showroom floor making sure everything is priced according to their guidelines.
bad,I have worked there twice. The regional management is horrible. They are worried about themselves and make decisions base on protecting their butts. Store managers are all friends of the regional manager so he can protect them and they can protect him. Bad for employees.
bad,"I was underpaid for the # of hours I was working (salary at 50+ hours)"
bad,"late start, learned how to install appliances, workplace culture was everybody for themselves. hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. customers faces when they got their products"
bad,Management don't care about their staff or the tenants  only their target performance.  Salary is poor considering the workload and abuse taken from tenants and expectations from management. Really high staff turnover....office staff unhappy and stressed...engineers unhappy and overworked.
bad,"After putting in 10 years for the company not one of my previous managers contacted me before I left to say goodbye. They had horrible turnover due to how they treat employees since a VERY COMMON term is, ""Another motherf*cker at the end of the couch"" referring to all employees are replaceable and expendable so not to worry about a bad employee. Many times I worked long hours and made the company a Substantial amount of money and I had little to no praise to it. And the moment that something went wrong I was told I was worthless manager and a piece of garbage. That's when I put in a 3 month resignation."
bad,The store i work from was much more concentrated on one individual and was difficult to do anything new or think out of the box since he run the whole show all by himself
bad,Base pay is $9 an hour for a position where you are the most responsible for customer satisfaction and product condition. Don't expect to make any more than that with yearly pay raises which cap out at 20 cents for hourly pay. There is stop pay which is nice but that starts out at $1 and it is split between you and your passenger for the first year or so I was told. My first raise was a whopping 12 cents to hourly and 20 cents to my stop pay which doesn't amount to much since you're basically selling them your back. Daily duties start by staging all the product which is being delivered for the morning run with a delivery window between 10am-3pm but some days you'll pull up to the store and the accounts department will have loaded both trucks to go as soon as you clock in because it's a busy day... or some days the GM will have you do little things here and there for an hour or two on the showroom floor and then have you stage everything which turns out to be a busy day so you have to work through your lunch break. On a typical day when you return to the store after the morning run the GM lets you go to lunch if it's not past 3 and then you come back and run the evening route which is more of the same. Your first week of work will be spent in front of a computer screen taking tests and watching video's which in no way reflect how a practical day will go but I'm sure in some ideal world they might serve a purpose. I know it varies from store to store but the PT's were never allowed to touch the paperwork for what was going out unless the GM was busy and we needed to move things
bad,"Aarons will be a great place for anyone who is single who does not want a life outside of aarons, they work their managers till there is no life left."
bad,"I've been an employee of Aarons for exactly 5 months I was hired as an MT at a pay rate of 11/hr and now I've been promoted to CAM for the same compensation. It makes no sense to be held accountable and have more responsibilities and have the pay rate remain the same. The job is very stressful depending on the area and your customer base. Since I've started working for the company I haven't worked anything less than 45 hours a week. Asking for a personal day off is like asking to win the lottery you'll have better luck winning it. Employees come and go at an extremely fast pace. So you'll constantly be picking up work slack. As a former Marine, the stress the pressure and the workload is manageable but the goals and expectations are somewhat far fetched. I like a challenge and I love to work but I'm also living in the real world. I thought with a promotion I'd have a better pay and finally my hours of hard work will have something to show for but I was mistaking."
bad,not fun. everything is from the inner circle if you are not included. drivers get treated like dirt. and general managers do not care for personal life.
bad,You have to learn to balance company growth in both number of customers and profitability in a professional manner. To treat every customer with respect and dignity.
bad,"Great benefis, low pay, long hours. All my coworkers are awesome, they are great people and make the job. Great stepping stone, would not suggest for a career."
bad,"As a sales manager your responsibility is setting up the sales floor, and moving product to the loading dock when it is sold. I ended up doing the job of a delivery person because the locations I worked at were short staffed. Moving and assembling furniture for 10-12 hours a day is no easy task."
bad,"Typical day at work involves Calling customers at 8am and Knocking on their doors till 9pm."
bad,"The bottom line is the bottom line. Selective in advancement approach and training. Subjective and vague management training, which tends to leave a person unprepared and anxious. Pressure and stress unrelenting. Sensitivities to employee needs were cosmetic, and not very helpful."
bad,"sales driven many unattainable goals, high prices. district manager did not appreciate the hard work employees put in to their jobs"
bad,You are expected to work from 45 to 55 hours a week and the pay is too little.
bad,"They had me start working before I even got my training and had me put things together without even showing me how to do first, lonnng hours, management virtually non-existent nor professional and back breaking work while getting no appreciation for anything"
bad,If you want to move up in this company you have to do some under the table work if you know what I mean .  management has know idea how to treat there deliver drivers they thank the deliver drivers job is to do all the cleaning even if the accounts team dose the return the dd have to clean the stuff when it is supposed to be who returns the stuff so if you thank you can go in as a driver and move up you got it wrong  unless you go under the table
bad,In any company you should expect a certain level of professionalism.  In the Payroll department at there number of issues.  First everyone does things their own way so there is zero consistency on supporting the employees.  Payroll employees have formed cliques and there is a lot of backstabbing and talking behind each others back.  The director of payroll herself gets involved in this and at times is the cause of it.  The employees get together outside of work to make sure they keep the stories together to weed out any new employees they can.  They do not like or want change.  Anyone qualified can be there for 10 minutes and realize the department is overstaffed and the employees know this.  There is no system of metrics and zero system of accountability.  People whom apply for a payroll position be where.
bad,It is a nice job as far as meeting new customers. however when it comes to your responsibilities at the front counter there is no assistance in which to help each other in order to gain better performance. Most of the workers are all to themselves.
bad,". A typical work day included, open and closing duties, daily activity plan to assure smooth business day and employee effectiveness, delivery scheduling, daily marketing plan, daily goal setting, bank run, employee delegation, supervision of employees, phone sales, floor sales, phone promo's, organizing and cleaning, product assembly, cash register, customer contract overview, collections calls and door to door contact, merchandise ordering, loading and off loading trucks, solving customer service issues, etc."
bad,an unorganized company who does not seem to follow a strict training program for new hires.
bad,Work extremely hard for very little money. Great job for someone right out of high school but not if you are looking to support a family.
bad,"Great place to work, need more management with experience."
bad,"Upper management does not care about their associates, only themselves. It is all about numbers to them instead of people. People should always come first and the numbers will follow."
bad,"If you are looking into something that you can grow in and be able to provide for your family with Aarons’s is not it. There is to much wrong to be able to type in this review. Does not provide competitive pay for the work you do, and are always requiring do duties outside of what is required of you without compensation or acknowledgement, very over worked and stressful environment."
bad,"They will sell you a dream, wake up to find a nightmare. Sell sell sell no customer walks. That's a crazy way of thinking. Not everyone who walks in a Aaron's store is going to lease something."
bad,"If you're a fan of lifting awkward, heavy objects up to the third floor of an apartment in 110 degree heat, this is the job for you. While management at the store I worked at was decent, often approving requests off, my time there was full of office gossip that management failed to address. Work schedule was often brutally packed or dead stand still, with little gray area. Often times knowingly scheduled deliveries to be finished after scheduled shift end, with end of day tasks still expected. Manager did not disclose time frame for insurance enrollment after hiring."
bad,No never again would i work for this company. They are unprofessional and not considerate of others and there schedule. Need more attentive managers that are helpful and nice rather then being rude with an attitude.
bad,Customer mission based but not very good at balancing for employees and compensation bases. They don't really allow employees to have a life or be compensationed for it. They seem to not care about their employees worth and what they have to sacrifice to work their. Lately they take away bonuses and paid vacation away for long time employees.
bad,"I would prep deliveries and paperwork, load merchandise, make deliveries, setup equipment and furniture. Take down setups and return merchandise to the store. Maintain inventory on showroom floor and in the warehouse. Train new product technicians setup/breakdowns, basic maintenance on products, paperwork, companies rules for deliveries and retrieving of merchandise."
bad,"The company as a whole can be better. Daily changes and no one is on the same page when it comes to changes. When weekly goals are not met, some managers decide to write up their employees which eventually turns into termination which isn't fair when employees should work as a team and all should be held accountable. Aaron's isn't a fun company to work for anymore, it is getting more stressful by the day."
bad,"Was told over and over we were moving to another location, but never did. Lots of false promises. No opportunity for advancement. Great benefits though."
bad,"The company is struggling to become a relative company in today's market. It struggles with employee satisfaction, retention and compensation.  I believe it will go the direction of Sears in the near future."
bad,"Regional managers only cared about numbers, number of leases signed up regardless of what someone could afford, regardless of adequate job verification."
bad,"all in all working for Aarons was ok the management was just terrible. however, the techs i worked with were decent people. not much for growing from within the company though"
bad,"Good company overall, long hours, however; management was disrespectful on how customers were treated.  Good customers who fell on hard times and were late a few days on payments were told we would have to pick up their merchandise where as I would work with them on partial payments and setting up final payments.  Just good customer service and being a good representative to the company."
bad,"Well in my 3 years of working with company the experience was sub par different manager changes every 6 to 7 months nor did I ever get a pay raise. I had a good relationship with my co workers and GM, but with so many changes in the restructuring of the company it became stressful. The hardest part was being stagnant for so many the job itself was very easy but being there I felt no growth."
bad,Aaron's is more of a retail temporary job unless you are wanting to get into a lower paying management opportunity. The company is high stress and micro managed.
bad,"Aarons is a good company and they really treat the customers right. But Aarons hires the wrong people. Associates who look uncleaned, smell like smoke all day. Down right rude associates. They're just hiring bodies. Aarons need new standards and new culture"
bad,"I believe this company has changed ever since the founder's culture was lost at heart.  Most of the time we would start a work day at 9am then end after 9pm, which would leave me too drained for personal life."
bad,"Start with strategy meetings with sales and collections to map out day and set goals.  Load product for delivery.  Conduct week inventory.  Continuously interview for new talent.  Customer interaction through out the day.  Mid day follow up on strategy meetings to evaluate progress for meeting goals.  "
bad,Aarons is not a bad place to work. it can be a kool place to hang out if your paired at the right location and with the right team. the issues are the pay and the work schdeule which often demand you work late every friday and work EVERY weekend.
bad,the management sucked the gm will work you till 2am then want you back up there at 10am most time taking lunch on the road then get yelled at for deliverys not going out fast enough.
bad,"Working there isn't too bad. Management will want to do 110% but will never offer overtime. Also, the will not help you with moving up in the company. They will want you to stay in the same position for as long as possible."
bad,this is a horrible company to work for! manager is an a******. Stressful environment.i would never recommend this place to anyone. only good thing is that you get Sundays off
bad,the newyork office is finally turning around after the realignment and change of management but its the same thing to a  sense ....you are as good as your last number
bad,I've seen several co workers come and go in 2 years been with company. Company DOES NOT take care of problems brought to attention. This company allows upper management to bully and harass customers. Company RM forces you to work in unsafe work place.
bad,Long hard hours lifting heavy product on and off of trailers by hand. pay was not very good at all and management didn't really care about lower employees.
bad,The job just didn't pay enough for the hard work u put in for the company..I got terminated for a wreck that I had in my personal vehicle 4 months after it happened
bad,"Was there for about 3 weeks! Not willing to train properly, sorry attitudes! This job used to be called sales manager!  Should be called gopher! Or warehouse manager!"
bad,"managed 3 departments in the store, sales team, NONS team, and the delivery drivers. Sell product daily, than deliver it, than collect on the product. Review and approve files daily. Call customers that were more than 30 days late."
bad,"Vulgar, aggressive, abusive management. There was 1 manager out of the lot of them that was 'in-tune' with the other employees. The store manager had no reality of what was going on in his store, or didn't care so as to protect his 'favorite'. The other associate level employees were there doing there job, and would do so to the best of our ability despite the environment. Rent to own isn't hard to understand, and dealing with the customers was never an issue, and heavy lifting was expected."
bad,"The benefits of the job are great such as pay and incentives are great. However, the work environment is the most unsafe environment I have ever had to work in. There were no safety procedures in place. Forklifts are coming from all directions while you try to push a large couch on a hand truck with obstructed vision. Co-workers climbing up high stacked and heavy couches to tip the top one off and let it crash to the floor while jumping out of the way before it crushes them. The work is only tough due to the weight of the items, and was expected to be a challenge. What was not expected was the non-existent safety protocols."
bad,This is a hard job to do u have to help  people who have a bad attitude. You will get some people that is friendly that made it easy to do the job. I was just used to it.
bad,"Upper management is wonderful, open door policies, listens or pretends to, open to ideas but at the store level it is constant work with no time for a lunch but you're reprimanded for not taking one, all marketing I did was done off the clock either on lunch or off days. It really has potential and I feel and hope this experience is unique only to me."
bad,At this time I prefer not to say. This organization has the potential to be better but some management needs to change firs
bad,Word day 10 to 12 hours of Sales and chasing customers for payments. Learn Aaron's talks about flexibility for there customers actually its money or merchandise. Upper management from Aaron's Corporate rude and disrespectful very self centered with many negative words even though they do little work themselves. Hardest part of the job is collecting money and gaining Sales where unemployment is very high.
bad,"Great benefits, An great crew to work with however to much work for and underpaid Job and Unfairness in the work place"
bad,"move furniture, service issues, take payments, collections, price merchandise, sales, marketing, meetings, deliver furniture."
bad,"Come to work and call, collect, and close deals. Management is inconsistant, unprofessional, and changes way too often. The hardest part of the job was taking the verbal abuse from upper management. The best part of the job was providing prodects to people who cannot get them to regular means."
bad,I liked this job in the beginning because of the starting pay but they work you like slaves here. i only worked at this Job for 3 months i believe and got let go for the bosses own personal reason and until this day i still dont know what it was. i just took it as a sign from God that this job was not for me and that there was somthing eles out there better for me. And God was right.
bad,"A typical day at Aaron's starts at 10am cleaning and making the showroom look nice, which is probably the most enjoyable part of the day. Then it goes on to processing and inputting files which entails calling customer references and going through customer information. Lunch is anywhere between 12:00 and 3:00. Aaron's is a very slow moving store. Few customers come in thus there is a lot of down time which means you have to do a lot telemarketing. Intermingled with all of that are sales. When a customer comes in, it is expected to approach and explain what Aaron's is and what they do. The management is not so good, they aren't the easiest to work with. I didn't feel comfortable with a two-faced approach to customer service nor being treated like I was incompetent. The hardest part of the job is working with management and the very slow day. My day would start at 10am and end at 7pm, which left me with very little time to have a life. Overall, Aaron's is a good job to have while you're looking for something more. I was paid $9.50/hr plus commission which was good for just starting out in sales."
bad,Working at Aarons can be rewarding when it comes to helping people. However that wears off with in a few months as the in house traning is poor and you worry about the whole store being fired over unpaid accounts youll soon learn you cannot trust management and will always be waiting on cut day they wont fire you but they cut your hours so bad thatbyoull jabe to leave
bad,"I cant speak for every store because i worked at the Easley, SC location but the job is so much more than delivery driver. The company just hires anyone to become a manager. Wether they are plain out lazy, or just dont care to do their own job. All the female managers at the Easley location are just too under experienced or the title of manager has them in way over their head. I worked as a Driver for about 10 months and didnt have a problem with it until they started bringing in these women who were unbelievably lazy to start barking orders at me and the other driver. Then we started to do parts of their jobs that they were first up for but never did Because quote ""they were always too busy making calls"". So to wrap this up, being a driver wasnt so bad, but i wouldnt work at the Easley store under any circumstance."
bad,"most of my recent employees were GREAT not going to name them all including both GM's. Upper mangement was horrible, had several different RM's and they all had different ideas on how to grow the company in which it didnt. the hours that this company has its employees working is going to make the turn over rate sky high. your employees dont have a life. JUST LISTEN TO THEM !!! accounts dept on saturdays 7:30am-12pm or 1 for some stores and i have seen them work till close which is 6pm now. NO LIFE !!! .. Sales 10am-6pm and then on Sundays now 12-5pm NO LIFE !!! Im saying this to some it all up. If we are one team we should ""work"" as a team. RM, VP, and the rest should work as well. Holidays we half get now while yall are with family and i think that is disrespectful on some many levels. I mainly left due to the hours there, my employees and customers i will miss dearly but i had to follow my heart on this decision. My family comes first and working with this company i hate to say it but you basically visit home and stay at work !!!"
bad,Look I can get on here in say so much to make Aaron’s sound like it’s the best job I ever had but I’m not going to get on hear in lie if another company called me tomorrow I would never go back to Aaron’s I’ve been past over for jobs I’m more then qualified for you will get with this company and work your butt off and still they will want more it’s just sad that you work for someone that treats you like a robot and you and constantly to repair
bad,"Typical day: answering phones, selling over the phone and on floor, filing, assisting others. "
bad,Aaron’s used to be a great place to work until new leadership came along. Now they are open Sundays and holidays. One spends more time there than at home with family.
bad,"What the company expecta from its sales team and what it delivers are disproportionate. The only way to make your bonuses and commision is if other departments preform well, so reguardless of if you produce what uou were supposed to you pay relies on someone else's work."
bad,This job is more demanding than what it pays. The managers (RM & GM) expect you to come in on your off days and work off the clock. YOU ARE NEVER OFF!
bad,"You do get to meet and help some really nice folks. You also have to deal with folks who aren't so nice. It can be a very challenging and rewarding job as long as you have a team built to around you that cares and wants to be successful. The old saying"" good help is hard to find."", well tht's true. Working for these particular owners is frustrating, due to the fact of always struggling to have inventory for the store and for customers. That's probably the biggest reason for not being a good review."
bad,I am not comfortable writing about the company that I currently work for. I like my job however the company has changed directions and it's focus over the last 4 years
bad,I enjoyed the job itself. However the management was very rude and disrespectful. Employees were rude always thought to be better than one another. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,I have not worked there in over 10 yrs. While i was there I worked with some good people and then I worked with some people that were unprofessional and showed a lot of favoritism.
bad,a typical work day was to deliver appliances and furniture to houses.. the hardest part about the job is getting the merchandise in and out of places.
bad,Can't have a lot of personal time off. Limited to the days that they choose. Management is depending on location. Always changing. Hardest part is dealing with customers.
bad,"I didn't work for corporate. But Aarons as a whole has a nice system, it is east to learn and maintain. The work my be hard and stressful at time but I truly enjoyed the time I spent there."
bad,"The job itself was absolutely easy. The homes and customers of course got tough but was expected. The management or lack there of at times was ridiculously two faced. The extra work put and blamed on the pts was insane. The lack of communication was insane. I on multiple occasions stated i didnt feel comfortable delivering certain things in the condition that they where in and was told either just do it or i can be replaced by someone who would,just for those items to be returned or discounted for condition....that we get blamed for."
bad,"You have the potential to make money but that means spending your entire life at Aaron's. Management is poor and would lie to customers to make themselves look better and working at this company I have encountered harassment from management, as well as, gender discrimination from management. You have to have a thick skin to work for this company. I loved my customers and endless ways to earn money, but it starts to take a toll on your mind and body when you have to hate coming into work because of stress and misconduct from Management."
bad,Lack of management very stressful. One minutes it's this rule and the next it's this one. Nothing you do seem to be appreciated. Only thing thanks pointed out is what you are not doing. Pay changed to bi weekly.
bad,"The work does not match the compensation here, the job requires a lot of hours and some stress. The hours and stress do not balance out with the pay that you are awarded for it."
bad,if you have no other choice of a place to work this is ok.. you are going to peoples homes and trying to get them to pay their bills or you are forced to take what they rented.
bad,"the manager at the conroe store always seemed to have his head up his rear and not know what was going on half the time, the warehouse was poorly organized, the floor was at times also."
bad,"The company is a great company to work for, but the constant changes throughout the company's executives bring uncertainty. Salaried associates pay structure is very competitive, but comes at a huge cost. Typical salaried associates work 6 days a week and log over 60+ hours weekly. Work and life balance is becoming more difficult to balance with an increase in work load, and less focus on quality of life from the corporate office. The typical work day starts with calling customers in regards to the expired rental agreement, handling service issues, and making sales. Hours of operation are 10-7, but associates work schedules can vary as most locations are working from 9am to 9pm."
bad,Aarons is a well organized company with room for growth. The processes are proficient and well thought out. The hours are very long and the compensation is not competitive.
bad,"long work day"
bad,Management blamed staff for their poor performance. Should not have  family in any company. If not for some of the staff would have left long before they changed everyone.
bad,"management is expected to be at the store open to close every day, the hours don't allow you to see your family.  to move up in this company it doesn't matter how well you do, it is all about who you know."
bad,"N/A"
bad,"theres alot of whats expected of you,your duties grow increasingly more each week,compensation and potential to move up is restricted and highly unpredictable,and issues arise when you use vacation ex)lost your request form,the bottom staff have no voice"
bad,"ran like the mob.its not what you know, its all about who yo know. most work environments there are male conscious.your work you do means nothing,if someone hire up in management don't like you, your fired"
bad,"I would be in the store by 7:45 am each day. Afterwards, I would do a thorough sales floor walk-through, to properly write down that day's strategy for my sales team. "
bad,Overall not a bad place just had problems with the gm.The job i had was a 45 hour a week one but i worked over 55 every week. Hours where 8am-9pm mostly.
bad,"Due to some issues with child care, I was let go. It's not like I could have brought my 4 month old foster daughter to work. There were also some issues with harassment from another co-worker (manager)"
bad,"cleaned back warehouse"
bad,Aaron's would teach you to build and fix thing you could never do be before...  I loved my co-worker well some of them... The management sucks to me cause the care more about their costumers then their employees then again... I am don't get me wrong I had fun at work all the time but if you want to have a life Aaron's is not the place for you to work
bad,"way too much drama"
bad,for the pay the job that I had as a sales pro or sales supervisor carried too much responsibility. my co workers were excellent for the most part however when one wouldn't complete their job it would hurt the entire stores chances for advancement and it seemed like nothing was ever done to rectify these problems. I worked at Aarons in florida and it was not this way it was extremely organized with ample room for advancment
bad,"There is no typical work day at Aaron's. Each day is different. I've learned how to be more patient with and expect change at any second of the day, and be prepared before hand. My co-workers are okay on a personal level. I am with my co workers more than I am my family. Hardest part of the job is the hours. Being a parent and a wife, this job doesn't allow an equal balance. Up until now I was great with working 13 hour days, until I actually opened my eyes one day and seen how tall my little had gotten. Although she lives with me everyday and I see her everyday, its like my parents and my mother in law is raising my child. There is no enjoyable part of my job anymore. Before I didn't look at my employer as a job, I looked at my position as a career, now its just a job. The job doesn't promote at a fair opportunity. Upper management promotes who is favored most instead of hard working, never give up people."
bad,"work hours are from 8am-9pm , with a one hour lunch break. You call customers twice daily with the intentions of collecting a monthly payment, if you do not have any contact through telephone numbers or references you go to there house."
bad,This company gives you empty promises on promotions..every time raises come around something comes around and you dont deserve it. You will not have a personal life with the hours you work..our region has a very corrupt upper vp..if ur not a man ur not going anywhere and if you start as a low man on the pole this vp who started out as a pt doesnt agree on promoting with in.
bad,Company says they are a great company to work for. But in actuality if you do not get the numbers they will terminate you fast. Its all about this and only this.
bad,"I have been in the industry 10 years, the last 4 in Tampa with Aaron's. Promotions are based on being liked by your RM, raises only happen when you threaten to leave by giving notice. The company ex pop acts more and more and more and compensates less and less."
bad,"Working for aarons was a very up beat job, everyday was an adventure meeting different people. Maintaining the truck was high on the list because lots of miles were put on the trucks each day. oil changes tire checks and changes, def fluids all changed and checked each day."
bad,Always had good staff to help with move in and move out furniture. Well trained drivers. Overall good company to work for. Good job for college students
bad,"When I started it was fun but then I relocated and it definitely wasn’t what I signed up for. It’s long hours less pay and I am a single father so I hardly have time to spend with my children. Not only do I not have time but if there is an emergency I can’t take off if there aren’t any sick days there is basically no understanding in management. My final straw with working here is they now will require us to work on Sundays which, when I started there was on Sundays and I’m the Sales Manager and have to dedicate all my time at this company and it’s stressful and draining."
bad,The job as a whole is a good and fun job. But the management at the location i worked at is horrible. My direct supervisor showed favoritism in many of ways. If all techs were doing something wrong only select ones were punished. HR had been called on this manager number of times and nothing had been done. So i left because of how i had been treated as an employee.
bad,"The position I had wasn't bad, but the management just walks around and mumbles. On the whole, Aaron's can give you good working experienc3 in a retail and collections setting."
bad,No real work life balance for store level associates. Operational hour are in the middle of the day and you have no time for family or personal endeavors.
bad,Aarons under the right management was a fun and active place to work. under the wrong management you could be made to just feel like a tool..pay could be better but it is a rent to own  company
bad,"Aaron's I will say is not a bad company but they don't care if you have a family. Positions above a PT or CSR will have you breathing, eating, and sleeping aaron's. Hours no problem, benefits no problem, no life well thats a problem."
bad,"Best part of Company: Coworkers.  Real team environment where everyone wants to succeed and do well."
bad,It has been a good experience to learn and grow for my professional career and am thankful for the knowledge and building blocks I have been given.
bad,"I was a driver, it was pretty easy only when management didn't get involve you could start your day with 10 delivery's and end up with 15 and they still expect you back at the same time.  All the furniture, electronics, and appliances that were used were no good!! And the store sold it like that!! I was never given proper training of how to assemble or work some machines. There was a lot of over time and you would get a dollar for every delivery you made which added up. Most holidays you would get off and paid."
bad,Job seems like a door opener for better jobs but customers are ratchet always taking things out on you and so does the staff. My boss is great but the people above him are nasty people. Possibly the worst job I've ever had. Long hours and not enough pay for the bs you put up with.
bad,"My schedule was 8hr shifts, however I had to work almost 12hr shifts daily and would get in trouble for having overtime, didn't make much sense and definitely not worth the 9.50/hr"
bad,"Need new management,and also need to train more training with people and also not to be stressing out workers.Need to respect there customers and understand that sometimes they cant do a payment with out help.Also they need to drop there prices on there product and also have a better service dept."
bad,learned a lot about how the furniture delivery business operates.if they would have offered more pay I would have stayed
bad,"sales pressure are intense, performance evaluations. high turnover ratio. need better wages for job functions. store management is great."
bad,"Usury concept taking advantage of those on fixed incomes, Carrot on a stick compensation plan. Closed Sundays,"
bad,"Love the Company, and my job greatly, Unfortunately I feel there is no longer any growth opportunity, and due to the type of business, heavy lifting and repetitive motions are often involved, they have very poor benefits considering the job requirements, I am sadly wanting to make a change to a company where there is growth potential, proper compensation, and a decent benefits plan."
bad,I would go in to work in the morning. My team and I would plan strategies for the day/week and go over our goals (met and not met for the previous day/week/month). Throughout the day we would organize the floor and sell to customers. We would do outside marketing as there was time. The direct store management was excellent. Very good to work with and for. The upper management was a little more difficult. They would come in and try and make our little store identical to their larger stores in larger cities. The hardest part of the job was meeting the sales goals sometimes. This wasn't always difficult as there were better months than others. The most enjoyable part of the job were our customers.
bad,Long hours. Crazy customers. They pay decent though and treat you pretty well.
bad,"My managers were great, but I don't like be threatened twice a week to get shot in the ""hood.""  You give the customers an inch, they take  it a yard with no repercussions.  Should you want to furnish your house for free, this is the place to go.  Nothing they do will stop you from stealing if you have no morals."
bad,There were too many occasions where I would not get paid all of my hours and had to wait 2 weeks or more for my money. When I finally received my hours they would not include my over time. More than once the current manager (07/10/2014) would get overly irritated when anyone would even inquire about their missing hours. They would disregard team lift and the personal safety of their MTs and PTs expecting them to deliver entire bedrooms and living room groups on their own without proper safety equipment.
bad,"Aaron's will keep you around for years because there isn't a really solid place for leadership, they promote the wrong people who aren't truly ready for their new found position. People from the outside usually don't stay long. They come into Aarons and make great changes and move on after a year or two of being with the company."
bad,very Short days at time. only 3-5 people work n d warehouse in their own area. didn't enjoy it at all
bad,"I work 12 hour days twice a week, new management is awesome co-workers are great, haveing to pick up customers furniture."
bad,I just have to get a better to to work at o have kids and bills to pay. I just need more pay to take care of my house hole and my kids cuz the money os no3 enough wher i was working at
bad,You do your job and everyone else's while they get to sit around and be lazy. Management will usually try to send you to do all the back breaking work by yourself and do it quickly with no mistakes.
bad,"Great entry level company to work for. growing constantly, and always opportunity for advancement. Rewarding as long as you can handle long hours and high stress."
bad,"good job, but the company requires you to work long shifts and very few days off. Rude customers and demanding management."
bad,"autozone is an ok place to work in, met a lot of mechanics and found out most of them love to scam people. the staff here is very friendly and so are most customers. very easy job but need to make sure you hit your daily numbers and sell that WTJR"
bad,"Time mostly spent chasing down deadbeats that either don't want to pay their bill or, for some reason, require being hounded until they do pay. My co-workers and managers are excellent, but the job itself just isn't enjoyable."
bad,"I usually make call for account receivables early in the morning and late in the afternoon, with visit to costumers during the day time to increase the amount of revenue in the daily basis"
bad,"Unpleasant work experience because they don't value the employees hard work. The standards were unreasonable, the raises were very disrespectful. The discounts were the only plus about the company."
bad,"Decent work environment.  Co. Does good things as a whole.  Pretty good Mgmt. /Some , but just not much variety in the job. /  No upward progression  unless already have skills. and Mgmt. is picky on any lateral moves."
bad,"Don't do it !! The Tulsa market is dysfunctional at the location I worked and"
bad,"Accounts manager/trainee (most stressful position) Typical Day start by calling all buckets (front, middle and back) to collect monthly payment. Explanation: Front bucket are people that are 2-14 days late, middle is 15-30 days late, and back is 30+ days late clients. The ""back bucket"" are usually charge off, but sometimes to meet the require percentage to close a bucket for the month, regional manager with put on extensions on those clients which will dump them back to the front hence giving you more time to ""harass"" the client to pay up or return the merchandise if it's still in returnable condition. MAJOR FLAW ""THEY DO NOT REPORT TO CREDIT BUREAU"". So once the words spreads people will go to the store, get merchandise and skip payment. The most we could ever do is start a civil lawsuit. We could not sue every charge off because it will cost the company too much money. The ones we did sue never appear at court since it civil court matters. ""You are the collection company"" quoted from regional manager training. ""This is not a office job, make the call and you get on the road and start knocking on these doors."" Keep in mind most of our clients are from urban ghetto locations. Another thing once you were told by the client to stop calling them you could not call them again. We use what we called in the office ""Ghost Phones"". Ghost phone were not own by the company and were used to call bad paying customers. The owner of the franchise once explain ""Our business is to sell. We sell to everyone and hopefully the good pay customers covers the lost merchandise from the bad paying"
bad,"Sometimes if the management isn't organized or know how to speak to employees, the business will not succeed.  Some are focus on the wrong things or aren't meant to be in leadership. Your environment controls success and the customers you attrack"
bad,They were a good company to work for. If they would hire me back I definately would go back to work for them I would.  There was alot of bad stuff going on within the company that I didn't approve of.
bad,All though management was good to me when my son was in a tragic accident. ( And I was thankful for that) I felt most days I didn't know if I was going or coming. I found this company to be disorganization.  And management spineless with certain employees.
bad,"You are constantly overworked and under paid. You have little to no time to spend with family. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upper level management. They sometimes make you feel no matter how much you do, you should always do more. Even though they were not interested in paying more. I would not recommend the job to anyone with a family."
bad,"Incompetent upper management. First: they were unable to manage interview schedule (RED FLAG).  Applied for sales Managers position, was shortlisted in top 3. After a week was offered Management in Trannie position. Another guy got the Job as a sales manager, with no Furniture sales or even sales experience and a totally fake management resume (another Story).  He quits within 2 days, they hired another guy next day. I’m like totally shocked; I mean I am the MT, I should have been offered the SM job.  After reading other posts, my story aligns with others in the same company. AS a management trainee I worked as a cleaner (cleaning sofas with cat and dog hair), merchandising associate, CS and loader etc."
bad,the travel meeting different customers everyday learning the structure of how to build off customer satisfaction with the product they received from there deliveries there reward program and more
bad,fun place to work when u get along with co-workers but where i work the management team sucked and complained about everything
bad,"Not worth the headache. But there is room to advance with Smith Group and Aaron's. They reward hard work, but will be more than willing to let you take the fall or handle the issues if it means they don't have to."
bad,"Terrible place to work. as you get paid close to nothing 12/h + ""Bonus"" per month that you hardly get to see. because the employess that make the sells fail to be organized."
bad,"I got a delivery list at the beginning of the day and spent the rest of the day delivering. Was qualified to do maintenance, clean and deliver funiture"
bad,rent to own in inner city is never fun but if it for you best rent to own company to work for
bad,Hard Work Little money. do all the hard work and dont receive the bonus like everybody else does.
bad,"At Aarons I worked from sun up to sun down, I never had a weekend off but i spent most of my day trying to get customers to get an account with is which was hard some times. Management was good at all at this job."
bad,The pay is not bad but you spend a lot of time at work for the pay
bad,"I always hear from the customers, ""oh, a new face? Go figure."" As an employee, this can be a little disheartening to hear when you first start because you second guess the credibility of your position. Apparently this location had a HUGE turnover rate. It's not hard to see why. Management was always changing, and they were very verbal to each other in their disagreements, EVEN IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS. Bad situations with customers were not resolved, they were made worse as if that customer was expendable anyways. I do not see eye-to-eye on their idea of professionalism, and I always felt awkward when management would argue. The upside though was that the work itself was quite easy."
bad,the job wasnt bad but pay sucked and managment was rude every day for no reason. co workers was stuck up hardest part was delivery
bad,"Not enough training for the job, management made it a very stressful place to work."
bad,"low pay, long hours, didnt care that i was a student. often had to miss class to the point that i had to quit."
bad,There is a general negative attitude at nearly every level I encountered. Promises are made that are rarely kept. The hardest part of the job is time mangement. The coworkers were nice and made the days bearable.
bad,Only five days a week usually forty hours with no weekends Monday through Friday job. Just have a hard time finding people to stay but for the most part easy job
bad,"Aaron's was a great company to work for; health insurance purposes etc.  I worked for them 15 years and I worked hard and yet not enough pay. This was the most disappointing area in this company.  I would not work there again.  Sadly to say, i do miss my job and my friends I made throughout the many years with them."
bad,"Long hours and weekends required, Great staff and alot of room for growth. Very fast paced and alot of attention to detail. There is also alot of oppurtunites for growth."
bad,Joined the team as a Sales Manager. This location the people were not very helpful with your training. The people were not very friendly. nobody seemed to like their job.
bad,the whole company is great its just the people that you work with. if your coworkers are great then working wont be a hasel
bad,I worked for this company for 5 years in North Carolina as a sales manager account manager. Moved to Florida And they made me a deliver driver
bad,Typical day at work would be answering phone calls taking correct payments sales calls floor pricing floor adjustments selling merchandise and payment plans leaened management skills and accounting skills and truck driving skills hardest part of the job is amount of un happy customers
bad,"It would be a great company if it was a faster pace environment. Also they require to much heavy lifting on daily basis, not suitable for women,"
bad,"This is a basically repo job. the hours are too long, customers are the worst. just a bad company to work for in new york city, maybe in another states would be better"
bad,"Too much to list.... if you need a job simply put. apply here. Brought home bed bugs within the first year, Found roaches in my car one time after winter was over along with a dead bed bug in the center console."
bad,"Maintaining contact with clients - giving them regular updates"
bad,"open business at assigned time. Get drivers ready to start their day  and get route ready for them depending on deliveries or return that is schedule for the day also get any services and route ready for drivers. Make my usual calls and collect payments for all accounts.  "
bad,T his was a 9 to 5 job. I posted all payments to ledger cards and balanced the books. I was also a customer service person receiving payments and solving problems for customers. The management office was in Atlanta Ga but very pleasant to deal with. My immediate Houston supervisor was a great person to work for which made the job fun. The hardest part of the job was collections. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and helping the inside sales folks. 
bad,Load truck with merchandise and deliver at appointed time. Maintain warehouse and merchandise.
good,Management constantly on you for the numbers. They say you can advance quickly at this job but unless you know someone to help with that it's next to impossible. At first the job is fun but you will soon come to realize that they do not pay enough for what you have to do. The hours are amazing if your the car or pt but if not you will work from sun up to sun down. It is a good place to work on your sales and customer service skills.
good,Unless your ready to have no family time this is the job for you long mornings and nights over work obligated to do more then required. Very exhausting NO LIFE !
good,"Contacting customers who were either late or default on accounts. Calling customers to ensure appointments for payment was not broken. Solving difficult problems with accounts, dealing with disgruntle customers while maintaining my cool at all times. Counting money and dropping money bags to the bank the next business day. I was engaged in sales when needed. I learned how to deal with difficult customers, and how to solve problems that required quick responses. Management was terrible, my GM was a novice when it came to operating the store. I would say his overall strategy was poor. Co workers were easy to get along with, I enjoyed working with the team. The hardest part was having to retrieve merchandise from customers who could not pay for the merchandise anymore. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people. Solve difficult problems, use cognitive reasoning. Also collecting payments on time."
good,"The lack of employee care & training within this company was evident from the first day of working there. The team I was taken on with were treated like school children."
good,"Everything was great here until the men of the company did not like women to be in management from GM position on up. They hired someone to take my place behind my back and had him training in a city away from my location and started changing my expectations on sales, inventory of store, etc that were not attainable and ended up wrongfully terminating me to bring him in.  I knew this was happening because the fool went into rent a center gloating and laughing about what Aarons was doing to me and he couldnt wait to get started and well i have no enemies so they phoned me and gave me a heads up.  Well on my birthday no less i was terminated."
good,I've learned more about myself and what I would prefer to do for the next ten years. I enjoy helping others and have also improved on my time management and customer service skills.
good,felt like l district manager was not fond of me .. felt he personally did not like me treated me terrible felt excluded not particular open to new people to the company .. they are very buddy buddy over there
good,Aaron's was the first job I had when I came back from North Dakota.  I had the opportunity to use my skills in both sales and collections. Both of these skills I greatly enjoy using.  The pay was just not enough.
good,"No culture of seeing task or project through. Not a career-oriented environment. If you need a career, this is not the right place to be. Management needs to be overhauled"
good,Didn’t like it it  management poor  fired for death in my family jus very poor looking for something better at work.no Mo comments after that rent n center
good,"I've worked in the RTO field for over 13 years. The negativity of collections and rude people finally took its toll on me. Even when I performed my job with all my ability, I was promised a GM position but was never given it."
good,I enjoyed working for Aaron's for 90% of the time that I was employed there. I was employed for over 5 years there and had never had any sort of issues until right at the end of my tenure with them. I felt like I had been passed over for promotion to store manager on a couple different occasions. That's ultimately the reason for me leaving Aaron's.
good,Sales business with accounts management and deliveries.  Lacking in team work and organization.  Difficult to move upward or advance within the company.
good,I think this company needs more work on their discrimination on their employees. I really loved my job but when new regional management came in it was all over for the tenure employees. If he didn't like you he got rid of you.
good,Good place to jump start your career.  Hard work/life balance.  There marketing and advertising is backwards.  Would I come back to work there?  Probably.  They pay really well
good,"If you are any part of management, be prepared to put the rest of your life on hold.  I learned a lot at Aaron's, I learned the in and outs of corporate America.  Management is paid very well, but with that your are expected to give your life to the company.  The hardest part of the job is all the hours you have to give.  The most enjoyable part is the money."
good,Aarons has gotten away from their culture and company beliefs.
good,the day was mostly about me and the other product tech moving all of the merchendice around the store loading our truck and unloading our truck and getting our paperwork together and when that was done we had to clean around the store.
good,They use you and discard you like trash. Always hire a bunch of fools to run their stores. You have a shelf life of 6 months tops if toy do deliveries and managers get shipped around like they don't have lives.
good,This company runs on allotted hours . The employees are only allotted so many and over time is not permitted. As a manager you have to make up those hours . Managers are paid salary . In the end you are basically working the hours of  2 jobs and getting paid for one.
good,"Allentown,Pa store will over work you, try to get over on you on doing things that not in the job description provided. They will want you to do returns, swap-outs, and moves but only pay you 13.50. They stack the schedule but then expect you to be quick but you got 10 things to do just for the morning run.  They changed the lunches to only 30min from a hour, the shift was 10am-7pm unless they changed it again but your guaranteed to work past 7pm 80% of the time. I worked for that job for 7months gotten injured multiple times they don’t offer workers comp, I’m almost 30 with back problems and pain that I never had before until i worked this job because they want you to go above and beyond to get stuff into ppls houses that clearly don’t fit threw the front door, just so they can get sales. You deal with a lot of attitudes from customers who call on you and make false reports that you was rude to them if they don’t get they stuff because it don’t fit, Barely get any tips...basically if you wanna work this job you gotta be ok with being a yes man and Brown noser"
good,"As a ""CAM"" your day starts with a conference call with the area stores and franchise owner. After that you spend half of your day calling the same people day after day trying to get payment on the furniture they have leased. In the afternoon/evening you went in the field to personally collect payment or repossess furniture. You are CONSTANTLY dealing with hostile people and upper management blames you when the payments aren't collected. "
good,lots of labor for little pay. not a career. good part time job or temporary job. if youre good at one thing expect to be told to do it everytime. wouldnt recommend.
good,"i enjoyed my position but the environment and hours where just too much.  i was always there on time but hours where cust out of check because of budget, i felt used but i miss my customers."
good,This place is fun to work at.I just did not like face to face collections.The company benefits was great. You are unpaid I must agree. I also did not like getting paid biweekly.
good,"Working at Aaron's was a learning experience. I would have loved to stay but, the management was very poor. There was no teamwork and it appeared as though every person was out for themselves rather than for the company succeeding."
good,There is definitely a culture shift.  As it begins to level off I am sure it will be a great place to work.  Just a little unstable right now. As they redefine themselves in the age of technology they will gain new success.
good,It was a fun place to work and not very hard work but very busy nice people around and very fast paced.l deliver furniture and ran accounts made phone call all day and clean the warehouse.
good,"Field collections are ridiculously dangerous to the employee. "
good,"The group I work with are not trained properly just given task and asked to do it there are no explanations as to what the daily goal is and the time line that it is to be completed by. Once the task is started the employees are told  to stop by another person and there are sever communication issues. There are also inappropriate behaviors between the manager and a couple of employees. "
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Too many hours, and not enough compensation. The people I work with are good, but the management demands too much, with little or no leadership."
good,Aaron's is a good company to work for and good pay if you are single and do not working over time because you will. It can be a very stressful job depending on your title. If you have kids or a home life this is not the job for you. I learned how to deal with customers on a positive and negative perspective. co workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to meet the numbers and percentages coaching customers to pay their bill. because lets face it you can't make people pay their bills. I loved traveling house to house it got me out of the office. I felt like my own boss. I did enjoy working for Aaron's however you do have to give 150 percent of dedication and life.
good,I wouldn't recommend anybody to work for this company.  You will spend your whole life at work.
good,"Delivor, repair, and clean furniture."
good,My day would start preparing for a sale.
good,Worked there for awhile. They couldn't keep anyone around. Hard to keep training people when you know they won't stay. The owner is pretty understanding. Unless your in management.
good,Working at Aaron's was and enjoyable experience. I loved interacting with customers in person and on the phone. My job was Accounts Manager and i was the person to call you if you were late with your payment.
good,Once was a great company to work for now this company is going down hill very fast.  No appreciation show at all and people in corporate offices are liars a d scam artists! Made good money but never  enjoyed it always working!
good,It was initially a fantastic place to work but as the company progressed they took away the few things that made this job appealing. An replaced them with horrible options. An they raised their expectations an cut everyone’s hours. Demanding the the same outcomes
good,They have alot of work to do to better there company.start by not by frieding someone after they get into a car crush when it not even there felt.if the truck not taking care of and has bold tries then you send out a new driver by them self during ice road and snow coming down and they hit then ice with no good trieds but 1 a slide off the road then gets injured then let go afterwards not then right thing to do.
good,"Aarons is a very physical demanding job, as well as mentally exhausting job. you work an average of 60 hours a week management is expected to work a min of 60 hours. Corporate is very demanding and constantly calling and changing things last minute. The pay is ok compared to most jobs but it is low compared to the work that is required from you."
good,the job was fun but then they had to many rules and regulations which made the job impossible to do the manager was good but the assistant manager would run his mouth and not get in trouble for it
good,Aarons was a decent place met alot of people but the management was unprofessional and rude. Was a good place to work but awful hours and 6 days a week.
good,this is a money based company with no remorse for how the customer is treated they threaten law suits and violate the law with how they go about collections. the attorney general has stepped in and they still violate the police given to them by the state. its a numbers game only
good,"poor management, expected to do everyone's job and yours while not getting the proper pay or advancements. Also raises are only cent, not dollars even for management, only way to make decent pay for the work you do is being at GM"
good,The Owners try to do a good jout wages are low and max effort  expected for min wage. some practices are needing to be reworked but for the most part the job is enjoyabkle only real down fall is the pay is low and you are paid monthly
good,It was just  asking for too much  and wasn't  paying  and you dnt have  a life when  I  started  I was  making  10.25 I was  there almost  2 years  and  they only  gave me a .35 cent raise and I  have too take things up and down stairs  and break  my back 4 nothing
good,"I loved my job and most of the people I worked with. In the beginging it was a great place to work, but the more i was there the more i was away from my daughter."
good,"Aaron's is a very a great company to work for if you like to be challenged and prove yourself to handle customer service situations,  You also have plenty of room for advancement as long as you are willing to put in the work. I learned a lot starting from the proper safe way to deliver furniture to being able to handle difficult customers and get them to ownership on their merchandise."
good,"Loved working with customers and doing my job, kept pushing forward to learn as much as I could. Helped wherever I was needed. Enjoyed working with my co-workers until some childish and very unethical situations could not be handled by management."
good,ok company to work for. Great PTO time give to all employees. Not opportunity for advancement. Great people that you work with.
good,"All in all its not a bad place to work, but the pay structure is weird and not competitive enough to compete with other high end sales jobs. They basically start you off at $9-10 an hour and expect you to do 30 things. Frustrating place to work because you never feel like you accomplish enough."
good,"Co workers were ok, Lacked good management very inexperienced"
good,"long hours, no time for family if you have one, Everything I know I owe to this company, co-workers are great,hardest part of the job is your whole life get suck in to this place, enjoyable part the people that work with and the attachment with customers"
good,"Good Company but needs to be more organized..I like the customer service aspect of it,they make the day enjoyable.The hardest part of the day is actually moving the heavy furniture and dealing with the lack of organization of the managers.."
good,You have to like phone calls to excel at this job.  You will be dealing with angry customers all day.  You will also deal with incessant phone calls from your boss.
good,Mid Level management needs significant improvement. Mid level management demand more than can be expected and offer little or no guidance
good,"Office Administrator/ Project manager"
good,Manager would schedule 3 hour lunces and make us work until 9pm nightly without having to pay overtime!
good,This is not a company you want to work for if you have a family or an active lifestyle. If you don't mind working 60+ hours a week then this is a dream job for you. Upper management does not care about your well being or your career. Its all a numbers game. THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE!
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the customer interaction. Getting to meet such a wide variety of people. I also believe my coworkers made my day enjoyable, we worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job was the distance of the drive with the amount of money I made and there was not much opportunity to make more."
good,The company does not value work/life balance. Upper management is inconsistant and continually threatening job security.
good,Better job if one is out there need to keep pushing long term if its the right look for you.people dont preach what they say about team work thats why its hard
good,"Wouldn’t make it a company that I would remain  at for year.. only a few months to 1 year. Management is poor. In order to hit commission each individual has to hit a specific goal, meaning if others did not hit their goal but you did you will not get paid for your hard work."
good,"Worked for the company for many years, loved what I did, as the sales manager. A lot of expectations and goals to be met. Small family feel, if that's what you like."
good,Overall its a good place to work. You will need to really research and know the area and clients where your stor is located. An absolute must is pay attention to scheduling and or inventory as this drives your daily goals. Set a standard of high goals that exceed the expectations and you can achieve your monthly goals. Be creative in sales and customet service within company guide lines.
good,The staff was cool but the town was too small. The Corporate office is run by pompous arrogant people who love yes men. That’s the downside of the company.
good,It is a great learning experience if you want to learn about direct contact with customers and how to work in the sales and account field. The system that they use is not difficult if you are a quick learner.
good,I didn't like working for Aaron's because of the way I got treated and never planning on going back ........... I'll never recommend someone to work for them
good,going different states enjoy being alone delivering fun place too work i learn how to not count on anyone new trucks alot of slackers at job others have to pick up slack
good,"Fun delivering merchandise to people's homes and dealing with the customers. Work load is reasonable. Hours sometimes a little long and it would be nice to have two consecutive days off. Pay totally sucks, and there is no opportunity for advancement or raises."
good,"I learned a lot while working for this company, unfortunately, most of that learning was self taught. Hours were long and it often felt as if I were performing the jobs of 2 people. Cold calling was an all day event that led to an all night event of trying to recover product from customers that did not make their payments."
good,A company that needs to take better care of the employees. I busted my back there for a long time and the turn over rate is huge people constantly quite there for a better job. There's no career there
good,"One word, stressful work environment. There is not very good training here. What I have learned I learned on my own accord. The departments turnover rate is high for this company. The benefits are horrible."
good,Not a bad place to work. Wish they gave yearly cost of living raises but they don't. So as the cost of everything is going up your pay stays the same.
good,"Use to work for this company, the pay isn't worth all the troubles you face as an account associate.  The expectations given to the works are beyond reachable at times and getting any sort of bonus is based on reaching your goals."
good,"Accounts managers are given unrealistic goals. You're on the phone or on the road to collect payment most of your day. Management in Missoula is great, but there's just no option for moving up in the company due to the downsizing that's been done in the franchise. Rarely given any kind of wage increase. Seems to always be a lot of drama. Best part of the job is the fun atmosphere with some of the employees and getting to know them more as you're on the road with them a lot. Worst part of the job is the lack of compensation for your work. As I stated, over worked and under paid. I worked no less than 55 hours a week. Luckily I was paid overtime when I was there, that is no longer."
good,I enjoyed the work but there was no room for advancement every one there had been employeed for 5 + years and no one ever moved up or down. They need better management training.
good,"I worked as a Product Technician (DELIVERY DRIVER) for Aaron's for a solid eight months, and could no longer deal with the burden."
good,"Working for aarons is 50/50 good and bad. I enjoy being out and about delivering furniture, meeting new people. But one thing that i dont like is the people in position to make the route sheet and set our deliveries are not very conciderate! They get to go home at their set time while we delivery drivers have to stay in the field until were done with the deliveries. So when 7pm hits everyone is at home with their feet up while were still out busting our buts for $11.00 a hour! Everything else is fine, may be better if we were paid rightfully for our labor!"
good,fun place to work.  lots of laughs.  Good for a student or an in between job while looking for a good one.  Dirty place because of the type of customers
good,"company is in decline, sales at an all time low, stores are closing, consolidation and lay offs are the current future for Aarons. Culture has changed over the years with less value placed on employees."
good,"You work a lot of hours, never had two days off in a row. Managers didn't care what it took to get their goals met as long as it was done. Very competitive!"
good,"All in all not the worst place to work, typical fast-paced retail setting. Lots of brass rings to grab en route to career advancement, while typically promotions occur as a result of political self-marketing. Pay is average to high compared to similar positions, but be prepared to spend the majority of your waking hours at work."
good,No advancement opportunities as role is not a typical helpdesk.  More like an escalated customer where you are answering all calls to Aarons.  Extreme nepotism with advancement only for programmers and developers.
good,Really enjoyed the experience of meeting new people and being able to help with their needs. The hours were good and met my needs for my home life as well. The owner was a very pleasant guy who came to visit the store at least once a month.
good,I worked with customers selling them products they needed or wanted. Sometimes people would just come in to help build their credit
good,"You can do everything right and never get a positive review or a positive comment.   YOur always in the wrong.   Working from 8 to 7pm on a slightly above minimum wage.  You are a delivery driver , furniture cleaner, csr, service manager , display set up person, merchandise unloading from freight, and accounts manager.  But my title was only customer accounts manager, not driver or csr"
good,"At Aaron's I was making less money than I have in years, and for that cut in pay I got backbreaking manual labor, hardly ever got off before it was dark out and when I did my boss told us we needed to work later. Management was lazy, the GM and everyone in the office all sat on their phones and goofed around for large portions of each day, but if me and my partner, the only 2 delivery drivers, were seen resting or joking around for even a second we immediately got more work added to our plate. The final straw was when our boss added a delivery onto our schedule at 7:30pm on a friday, it took us 2 hours, everyone else had gone home for the day and we were supposed to have 1 more delivery, we called and asked him if we could push that delivery as we were both exhausted and felt we could not adequately do it only to have him tell us no and offer no help. My partner quit because of that instance and I felt I could not do the job alone so I also resigned."
good,"After working for Aaron's I got to experience meeting wonderful costumers who I was able to make their day when I delivered the product on time and as stated through their sale. The downfall at the time was the lack of leadership, with all respect to Aaron's company the leadership at the time represented the opposite of what this company stands for. Since My departure with the company I have seen first hand how the new management team and teammates have work very a hard to prove and follow through company values it is a great store to walk into and I would be humbled If I were to get the opportunity to be part of the company Once again knowing that this time around it is a safe work environment and to prove my self-worth to work for a great company."
good,Every morning I would arrive at work and put together the day's strategy and have a meeting with the accounts department.  We would then get on the phones and try to collect all of the month's revenue.
good,"This company is good to get your foot in the corporate door.  There is little room to advance, and the management is questionable"
good,"While I thought this would be a nice change for advancement. Being a Sales manager was horrible, the practices used was deplorable for anyone. having to work around roaches and bedbugs was simply not acceptable!!"
good,I would not tell anybody about this job worst place ever I had a very good partner at working managment not good and the best day about work is when i was going home and i didnt learn anything at all form aarons
good,"Long hours"
good,I enjoyed working for Aarons. The managing of the store was very sketchy at times. Manager went against protocalls more than once.
good,"I wasn't aware I'd be working any more hours than posted on the door...WRONG. My typical day was 8am-9pm and two shorter days. As a CAM you can expect to be scheduled 50 hours a week. Don't think your such a good collector that you can get it done in less time, because you will work the schedule regardless. You will also find yourself visiting customer homes daily, sometimes all day, to get payments."
good,"A typical store has low number of employees all working one long shift per day.  The company wants you to fulfill multiple roles, much more than what was explained when hired.  Very high turnover rate."
good,"A typical day at work varies, the management is not very supportive. Many laws are broken within the job. You harass people, and it sort of makes you feel bad. You don't have a set schedule, and that makes it really hard. The pay is ok if you don't have family or major plans. It is hard to move up in rank, unless someone quits."
good,"Aarons has a very good video training program, management makes sure that you are well prepared for the job you are about to start. Training by an in-store employee is almost none-existent. after the tools are provided its a learn on the job type of training, training is up to you. Very company goal oriented, but not personal career goal oriented. You get the feeling you are replaceable and that opportunities to grow with the company can't be earned, they are given. The work environment at face value is a fun and happy place to work, but behind the scenes it's a bit different due to merchandise removal. Co-workers at Aarons are the best part about this job. the hardest part about this job is removing items from customers."
good,be ready to work 6-7 days a week with no life. lots of colletctions and threats from customers.
good,it was a good place to work for. if you like sales or collections this is the place to be
good,"Nice place to work, but thrown into the position without any proper training."
good,"i can honestly say that i was HAPPY when i was hired at Aaron's and enjoyed the work that I do until certain things started to come arise in the workplace... At the store that im employed at I am NOT compensated as a driver for some of assignments that are giving to me unlike other stores in the area (i.e: field visits, returns or service calls). Im only paid stop pay for deliveries , returns or field visits with money exchange from the customers. My job security wasn't a concern to me at first but nowadays because of the new management in my store its always in the back of mind that something could be brought up that could put jobs in jeapordy. The hardest part about this job is that at my store all the drivers arent treated as if we were real delivery drivers. We aren't allowed to load our trucks up with the deliveries for the day at the start of the day nor are we allowed to take lunch breaks on the road. That & the non-payments for assignments that we are giving are the hardest things about the job. The most enjoyable part about the job is to interact with customers in the field and in the store. I have always enjoyed interacting with people and thats always a plus when i get to go out and do such things like that"
good,If sales and or collections is your goal then this job is geared to individuals of that caliper.
good,Management was questionable at best during some periods. Employee's never felt like their jobs were safe. Overall good work environment..
good,Feel like I should make more money. But gratefull. Due alot and make many people happy. As in customers. Very hard worker. Never done till job is done.
good,Started out great with and incredible staff but overtime we lost a few key members of out higher management and I felt that some of the hired staff was there to sabotage the company and they did within 2 years their.
good,The bonuses are nice but dealing with the demands from management and the bullying that goes on makes it a difficult place to want to work. The way that the general manager deals with customers and staff is problematic but isn't held accountable.
good,I worked for this company for 5 years when they was a franchise it was great wonderful incentives and all about making life good for both sides employee and customer since the corporate take over the company has done nothing but change things and push out long term employees. The basic structure of the company is not at all bad just need to learn to hold  to what they tell there employees
good,"Poor management in entire distri t i worked withing several issues, as a delivery driver we would often come to homes there was no possible way of getting products into without damaging would constantly be told to figure it out or constant nagging about deliery times on average a full bedrrom set in a reasonable sized home whemn tools were available that we had to provide ourselves could be done in 10 to 15 minutes, when no tools were available and the difficulty of the home was greater than normal a simple bedroom set could take an hour or more."
good,"Here's the thing...Ready? It ALL depends on store management. Forget the company mission, policies or the preference of wanting to hire from within. If your manager is bogus you're going to have an awful experience. It doesn't matter how much you may want to learn or how much work you may want to put into doing so. If you're manager is a slacker chances are you wont get anywhere."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, pay could be better but you make a few extra dollars based off number of deliveries. For what the job was, I enjoyed it and had a good staff/team"
good,"Management is out of tune with leadership.  The culture is more of a personal relationship rather than professional."
good,"New management is difficult."
good,This company has incredible benefits. Aarons as a whole is changing daily.Sales goals are unrealistic and hours for accounts team sre unrealistic. Field vising customers is totally unsafe and unnecessary.
good,I enjoyed working here. I was able to have a desk job and also earn commission through the products i sold. The management was very harsh on me and every so often i felt bullied by the assistant manager for asking silly questions or not understating something right away.
good,"Aarons is an OK place to work. They used to have decent raises every 6 months, that was cut to once a year with no increase and then that was cut from a flat rate to how well your store performed. We went from getting about $1.00 a year to a varying amount from $0.49 to $0.02. So it went from livable raises to below inflation or basicly a pay cut ""raise""."
good,"Fun interacting, comparing and competing against stores within and outside your region.  Stores are closed on Sundays.  Health plans are very affordable.  Not a lot of upward movement within the company."
good,"Not a bad place to work, great for a college students. delivered and set up all various house hold items from TV's to washers. Get to travel all around northern Nevada."
good,"i worked for a franchise before it was bought by corporate. working for the franchise was great. we got our hours, and money, and coming to work was fun everyday. also. there was no commission at the time. of course we wanted the sale but it was a perk to be able to not feel forced to get people product that they were unsure that they could afford or not.  when corporate bout the stores they cut hours, added commission. so in terms most of us lost alot of money, and it ultimately change the structure of the stores. the employees felt it and most of all the customers felt it"
good,"A day at Aaron's is tough, start at 8am hitting the field to collect till 10am run your store until 7pm, then back to collections  till 9pm if you had repo's you clean before you can leave. "
good,"The area that I was in was run as a boys club environment. If you were in certain clique then you could be successful, if you were not then you would go unnoticed."
good,"I liked the work , employees and customers . there is always something to do . however I was told that I would be making a certain amount hourly and commission plus bonuses and unfortunately I was not .."
good,"Its an ok job nothing i would want to do as a career. Lots of heavy lifing and constantly getting yelled at, definitely need a thick skin to get by day to day."
good,Awful place to work. The franchise cares about growth more than quality. I would never recommend anyone to be involved with them unless it is temporary.
good,"if you don't mind spending all your time at work then this is the job for you. 40+ hours per week and advancement is possible with how fast some managers turn over. Honestly not worth the pay they offer. "
good,"The crew is great to work with. Being a PT just sucks. If you have no life to be home for then fine. You do the hard work and get paid less. You will be ran to death. You will keep that position longer because no one else wants to do it.  There's a quick turn over for a reason.  You can move up but you have a bigger target on your back from corporate.  Don't F up on sales or the phone they are always ""shop"" calling to check on performance."
good,"this company is certainly not an easy place to work for, very busy but does have its upsides. great bunch of people and the assistance is always there when you need it. "
good,this was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. Delivery Technicians are treated awful. First off we're scheduled from 8 - 6 almost everyday then end up staying from 8 - 10 almost every day. They get mad at you when you try to take a lunch because apparently that's wasting company time. It also doesn't help that my supervisor not only being a convicted felon on probation when I worked there. He also has zero experience as a Delivery Technician even though his supervisor position is supposed to be the promotion from my spot. He just came in and started there. Their Is to much wrong with the store I worked at to even explain everything.
good,Work hard with no payoff. More experienced employees make less money than new hires. Management passes the buck when errors occur. Working with a good group of guys is the best part . Hardest part of the job is working with unreliable equipment.
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. My job in itself could be better. I feel the company could do better with how they pay out sales commissions.
good,No longer an exciting place to work.  All about company growth with little to no employee growth and development.  Benefits are pretty good but the pay is not so great with little to no raises.
good,"There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm"
good,"Difficult job doing collections, sales, and field visiting"
good,"Good benefits, busy, changing, work environment. Learned about shipping receiving merchandise. Management was poor and disorganized. Co-workers were generally pleasant. Hardest part was collecting money from past due accounts. Most enjoyable part is field visiting past due accounts."
good,"Fast paced fun work place to work. Great people, great customers.Very demanding management. Long work hours. Tough on home life."
good,This is a good company with a poor management base. The potential of this company is good but it is hindered by the staff.  The general management is lax and needs attention.
good,"Up early, off late"
good,I didn't mind working at Aaron's except sometimes there was poor management issues and the hours were long.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  I hated lifting furniture up a lot of steps.  I enjoyed working with the customers.
good,we had great customers but i felt like management was lacking. also the company says they promote within which they don't. i acted as the sales manager for months. i was never offered the position nor was i given a pay raise when i took on the responsibilities of the sales manager.
good,"A typical day at work for me is starting with getting a strategy meeting started so we can figure out our focus for the day.  We then call any non-renewed customers and do our best to get them to pay in a timely manner.  We also field visit customers that have broken appointments with us, or that we do not have contact with.  The management team is extremely hard working.  I would say the hardest part of the job would be putting in 55 to 60 hours a week.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping people get on track to pay their merchandise off and satisfying any needs that they may have."
good,"You watch some videos where they talk about getting the customer to ""ownership"" but almost no one makes it and if they do they have paid more than twice what the merchandise was worth."
good,A typical day at work would include collecting on over 1400 costumers along with loading and unloading trucks. I have learned a lot from working here. It help me build better management skills and customer service skills. The management was terrible they never work and was hardly there. My co-workers were the best thing about the job they are hard working people and fun to be around. There is not really a hard part at my job. And the most enjoyable part would be talking to my co-workers
good,"I worked my bones for this company only to find out there is no appreciation from management.   Its usually that way with big corporations, that is why they are constantly looking for job seekers.  The bottom line is the ugly dollar."
good,"This job is ideal for someone who does not have children or want to have much of a personal life. Days are long. Customers seem to be rude and want everything for free. Merchandise that comes back is disgusting! Pay is not sufficient for the job or the title!"
good,"The people that worked there was a great bunch to work with. They send you through class after class to teach you what you need to know to do your job. To me, the hardest part of the job was to get new customers to the store to lease something. It is a somewhat relaxing place to work till upper management grips cause you don't have any new sales."
good,"Like most rent to own places, The will ripoff anyone. you pay 5 times the value of something"
good,"Everyone works hard and plays hard. Hourly pay is fairly poor. When AI first started there though the overtime compensated for the small ahourly rate. But, Overtime was cut in 02/2013"
good,Hit the ground running.
good,"Receive works from supervisor g through map books to decide the best direction to take to get to the address given by customer.I learned the best way to get full co-operation from the customer as well as my crew is to place myself in the place of both and treat accordingly. The management was alright in most situations,fellow workers gave their best.The toughest part of the job was piano r elocation.The best part was successful move with no problems.I also became an expert at safe and damage free moving of household and office furniture."
good,I have learned to get along well with others even in the most extreme circumstances. The management could be good with further training but is inoperable at the moment. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what hours you are going to be working on a day to day basis. There is no enjoyment other than occasionally receiving tickets to an upcoming event such as a WNBA game.
good,Sometimes long days due to starting time for the delivery driver position. Wouldn't start are day till 10am decent management. sometimes fun to work at. Aarons is a good place to work for advancement and good group of people
good,Benefits not great but it’s a job. Company going through multiple transitions. Communication not clear for employees between management and support staff
good,"I am a full time student and his job catered to my schedule which fan the flame of success at the job for me. Of course there was no wage advancement not even annually. I started at 12hr a year later still 12hr."
good,The pay was great plus commission sometimes. Didn't like the outside marketing ideas. Really time consuming barely had any time off. 11 hour shift every Friday.
good,It’s ok job it would be better for someone with out a family a lot of times your all over the place from Sheffield Alabama to linden Tennessee and a lot of drive time sometimes
good,"Worked too many hours to be paid salary, upper management care about money, not employees, anybody is replaceable, and cost of leasing high! The hiring process was easy!"
good,working at Aarons was a good experience. my coworkers were nice fun and made the work environment a little better. i also got good benefits such as discounts for my home furniture and it was overall a good experience working there.
good,"It's an ok place the pay could be better for what is asked in fact it should be closer to the $15 an hour for the job at hand delivery, movers, cleaners. Etc"
good,They don’t care about customers or employees. Their program sucks and doesn’t help anyone. If you are a CAA you will be out until 9pm almost every night and knocking on people’s doors who are already mad that they can’t pay you. Customers cuss you out daily and don’t care.
good,They can't keep managers in the store. They change everything way to much. One day your used to doing it this way then next week it's doing it that way. You can never get comfortable doing it one way cause everything is so up in the air.
good,"It's a good place to start but not for advancement . There are cliques. Figure that out for yourself. Figure  6 months to acclimate to the culture."
good,"I worked at Aaron's two different times, and nothing really changed. Management had no clue what was going on from one store to another. Wasn't a fun or competitive environment. Everything was based on management by intimidation."
good,"Good company good work ethics but not completely followed u have the Aarons way which should be followed but then u have ur regional & general managers way.  "
good,"No room for advancement what so ever. I love the coworkers like family. If there were better ownership and opportunities to advance,  with flexible raises and better bonuses it would be an awesome job.  Need new owners for this franchise."
good,I just typed 350 characters and it wasn't enough space to accurately portray to a possible employee what they may or may not like and dislike about this company.
good,Nice environment but you work a lot and you have no time for family. But build go work relationships and the pay is decent. Working Sundays is a downfall.
good,This company offers a service that is needed in every community its core values are solid just like the program.  Unfortunately the business has decided to be open 7 days a week giving it's General Managers no time off.
good,Try to collect money owed to the company. Prepare to be yelled at if the entire team does not meet unrealistic sale goals. Always trying to find customers houses after customers move without letting the company know.
good,"Long hours. They hired me for a CAA position, but I was mainly on the truck making deliveries getting less pay then those who started out. My scheduled time of working and getting off was never met. I guess the discount on merch. Was nice but overall was not satisfied with Aaron's as a company, nor with how some of their employees deals with/ talks about their customers."
good,It starts out great then you spin your wheels when everything is about sales and repos. Bonuses for management is hard to get but possible if you have a good team.
good,It was good for what it was worth! If your just starting out and need a place to get experience this is your place! There was always work that needed to be done!
good,Boss was very OCD about keeping the service center clean and the bathrooms clean.  Cared less about my production than the misc bs around the service center.
good,Aarons is not family ordinated at all and has no structure for schedules lack of help is no excuse for others that should step up.  Great job for someone with no life or family
good,"The company I started with in 2003 was a great one that I fully intended to make my last job, I moved up the ladder very quickly and was very happy doing what I was doing. In 2013 the corporate structure changed and so did the ideology of the company. The CEO was a retired airline exec that managed to put Delta into Bankruptcy, he quickly rid the company of the leadership that made Aaron's one of the most financially stable companies, and replaced them with non-industry tycoons who did nothing but eliminate the fabric that made Aaron's, Aaron's and turned it into a company it was never intended to be. Salaried folks like myself were expected to work 65-80 hours weekly and were not allowed to claim per diem's despite the companies ops manual saying it was to be paid. If I could rate less than one star I would-- don't waste your time there..."
good,this company used to be awesome. several changes in senior management and management. only care about numbers and not their employees now. this company once felt like a family and now its all about the money
good,"A great place to start if you need sales experience. you will learn all about the company and the department that you work in cause you will have to take classes that will give you the knowledge you need to be successful in the company."
good,"It’s a good place to work, but the franchise it’s self doesn’t pay they’re pt’s enough for what we go through. The scheduling isn’t always easy but the job it’s self isn’t bad."
good,"I worked for a franc.hise. Corporate stores have benefits, franchise stores typically don't. As a GM you can expect to work a lot of hours, and in the rent to own business you typically work every Saturday."
good,"I enjoy working with many people from various backgrounds, I learned so much over the years and working with others is my specialty. I love learning what I'm capable of, handling many different people is something I take great pride in...."
good,I've worked at Aarons for 2 years. I haven't received a raise in those 2 years. I've had 4 different store managers with in those 2 years. I'm the only one that is still there. Everyone I work with has changed just as much as the store managers. They throw you in without training you correctly and watch you sink or swim.
good,If you are able to look past the poor and unprofessional management at Aaron's and the fact that team members will take a sale out from under you without thinking twice... the money can be quite good.
good,"My day generally starts between 830am and 9am and ends between 7pm and 730pm.  I start my day with paperwork and a round of phone calls (average of 100 calls).  I believe I have learned to be a great communicator and able to converse with almost anyone.  Long hours can take their toll after a while, especially when you have kids at home and you're a single parent.  I do enjoy the people I work with and the customers I have built relationships with over the years."
good,"Easy job to do, they give you a lot of hours to work, you get to earn commission really reflects on your pay check, they love the holidays and is always fun to decorate according to the holiday."
good,"Aarons is a company that helps people to obtain furniture needs on monthly payments."
good,"All was good at Aaron""s until I got promoted to AGM an was expected to just know how to do the job with no training. Was constantly yelled at for not knowing as well."
good,Company has changed a lot over the years. They do a lot of promotional events to help the sales team but there is little regard for the quality of customers that the accounts team then has to attempt to collect from. It is a one-sided business model and as an accounts team member this has become frustrating.
good,Its a popularity contest. As long as your on top then it doesnt matter what going on. But as soon as your numbers turn and new management comes in. Then all your previous hardwork goes unnoticed. And you become expandable. Previous management cared about the culture and family values the company was created on. Current management only cares about a number and if they like you enough to give you the tools to achieve it.
good,Fast paced but good work environment. Work week can sometimes be more than 40 hours depening upon the need. Team environment where everyone has to work together.
good,"Every day was the exact same. I learned a lot of leasing furniture, and how much more it costs to do so. My boss personally was a scam artist, and was kind of mean to certain people. It was a growing company business wise, but not much opportunity to grow. I enjoyed all of my regular customers."
good,I enjoyed my employment with this company however the work is extremely hard and the pay is poor. Management team worked well with employees needs. If pay had been better I believe I would still be employed with this company.
good,"Work enviornment is very positive and professional"
good,Terrible work environment. Not a family oriented place. No job security or advancement. Pay raises are very minimal. I would not recommend working here if you have a family or want to have a family.
good,"Fast paced, extremely stressful environment.  Tools to succeed are highly guarded, as if the older management does not want to ""hand over the keys to the kingdom"".  Very much stuck in and old-school way of doing business, and has lost sight of the fact that we exist in 2017, not 1985 or even 1995."
good,"Typical Day: First I would pull out over 7 lawnmowers (most of I had to pull out was 16) and display them in the front of the store"
good,"Typical day was never set in stone. It would range from running around town trying to take payments without any real training, to staying in store all day building furniture in the back."
good,my day would start with getting the floor ready and then start sales and paper work and also get working on phone calls did not learn from management  clean workplace  hard part of this job is the hours best part is helping people
good,"No room to grow, lack of pay for job demand and job title.Prefect job for young adult with no kids and willingness to learn retail, if you have no experience in any kind of management you will not advance in this company no matter how many years with said company."
good,"I'm slowly approaching my 2 years at this company and it has given me a true insight of how businesses are ran. Upon changing management, which was a very strict mangager but got his job done, everything ran smoothly and I actually loved my job. After a year later management change and everything went downhill. Though my current mangager is linear, he's very lazy and rude to the customers and it gives off negative energy to everyone else in the store. I'm the only coworker left and I just decided to put in my two weeks after I was denied to move from accounts to sales manager. I've dedicated myself to this job daily and I felt as if that was a stab in the back to not let me move to a semi better position. You spend a lot of time away from home and work long hours. Bonuses are somewhat good, benefits, vacation and holidays but you end up missing out on a lot being stuck in these four walls."
good,"Very difficult to maintain a work life balance. As a GM you have to always be recruiting. Currently very difficult to retain talent. For the level of responsibility expected from the associates, they can work for McDonald's for around the same hourly pay with a lot less headaches."
good,"a typical day consisted of making calls, updating goals, updating regional manager, taking calls, collecting payments and supervising accounts associates."
good,"Its all about the sales  no matter what, you have to create the sales be more do more go above and beyond for someone to take the credit"
good,This job has given me the opportunity to interface with customers and has definitely helped to enhance my interpersonal and business attitude.
good,"I was a 3 different stores during my time with this company. 2 were pure misery, and one was great. Sadly the store was shutting down and my relocation store was going to be too far away to travel to."
good,Products and Services sold inside of company were good but everything as far as store functions were not great at all. Management was very poor.
good,A typical day at work would be best described as productive but slow. Aaron's has about 5-8 customers per day and at least 2-3 of those customers purchase a lease agreement or buy straight out. I have learned a lot about sales and still have much to learn. My co-workers are great to get along with and management seems to be doing their job. The hardest part of my job would be not getting the answers when I need them because I ask questions to learn. I enjoy dealing with customers and listening to what they want and providing a great service.
good,Its no team work and horrible communication. I can say I learned a lot with customer service. Also my co-worker that works on the truck with me is great
good,Aaron's Sales & Lease has a great service that is provided to those from many different economic backgrounds. Upper management wasn't the best to work for.
good,"No job security. People are getting laid off. Not a good work/life balance."
good,"4 different GM's in a years time can't anyone realize just for a sec this might correlate to the RM being the truer issue! Or maybe even further up the latter in most cases. Must be nice to have, rah rah reeetail manager powers to point downhill on someone and throw your heavy weight gut on someone littler than you hehe,"
good,Traveled 75% of the time as an auditor. First job out of college and leared a lot working in the auditing department. At the time they didn't have any advancement so i looked for something close to home
good,Aaron's is a good place to get management experience due to the high turnover rate. You have a number of different employees so you quickly learn different methods to motivate employees. The job is based on preset goals that take total dedication to attain. You must be able to work a flexible schedule because you may be asked to work long hour to obtain monthly goals. In the event that you reach the goals as prescribed the rewards are substantial but it takes a total team commitment to obtain them and the long hours make it difficult because people have lives but the company doesn't attain for that aspect in the objectives.
good,"You work 50 hours a week sometimes 12 hours a day calling, making home visits, of sending collection letters to obtain payment if you work on collections, and you make marketing calls, send letters if you work on sales, as well as organize the sales floor and greet customers as they enter the store."
good,"The expectations for corporate store managers is insanely high.  Standards that are rarely met.  There is also a high turnover rate.  They promise ""give us a year and we'll give you a career"".  When the truth is you'll spend at least a year in each position before being moved up.  And even then the chances of being selected as a GM is doubtful unless the Regional Manager likes you.  Lucky for me I guess that my RM liked me!"
good,I used to work for 60 plus hours a week with overtime being your best way to make money but you were never home. A lot of run ins with micro managing regional managers
good,Im too active to stay in this line of work. I need to get back into school and with a schedule 11am-8pm there is no time for school.
good,Learned a lot and worked with some amazing people.  All in all a good place to work. Just wish there was a better work and life balance.
good,"Higher up managers...vp is very disrespectful, unprofessional, and degrading to people they dont like. I was not one of the ones to fall victim, but made me look for another company asap."
good,"This company is franchised in Canada and there are 2 locations in Calgary, AB owned by the same person."
good,"*Time management for me is very important to succeed in an Enviorement with growth potential."
good,Working in New Britain was another world all together. There were a lot of Spanish speaking clients that would not work with me because I did not speak Spanish. I liked my co-workers and they were very helpful and pleasant to work with.
good,I would typically work 9-9 and would close most days in the week. I learned how to run the store. My manager was nice but the others not so much. Great co-workers . Chasing and calling customers about payments was tough. Having sundays off was nice.
good,"Decent company, good pay, long hours. Management is ok but if they don't like you as a person they will fire you in a second."
good,"Typical day at work was energetic ,long and at times confusing. I learned organization and logistics skills. Co workers were team players. The hardest part of the job was the chaotic work schedule.The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team with my co workers."
good,"I love the people I work with. There are no benefits and very little opertuinites to move up. Also the pay is 9 an hour. One benefit is the discount, regular raises, and decent hours. Some bad management, they sometimes expect too much."
good,"Its a very steady job. Busy every week, work with good people. Starting out pay isn't the best but its not bad."
good,"Not a job for a single mom... Long hours, hard work, and only a $.10 raise after a year."
good,"Challenging business to learn. I was able to move up fairly quickly. Working in corporate America for as long as I have, I was disappointed in the professionalism of upper management. However it was a great opportunity."
good,I feel as if the company is based on favoritism and is no room for growth for hard serious workers
good,"This is not the type of job you want if you are not willing to put in minimum 45hr work weeks, as well as perform physical manual labor ie: return or deliver items such as front load washers and all other items as well. I felt like the company was not willing to promote me because I would put my family before my job. You would deal with some questionable characters that could try to get physical with you at times"
good,Typical workdays at Aarons consisted of producing new Customer sales daily and also collecting on past due accounts. The hardest part of the job was to get the customers in and let them know that the merchandise was needed in their homes. The most enjoyable part of the day was marketing.
good,A tpical work day at Aaron's consisted of come in meeting with my co workers. I learned more about Jacksonville as a product tech. Our management was pretty cool but unorganized.I got along with my all my co workers being that we spent majority of our day in the trucks making deliveries. The hardest part of our day was dealing with rude customers. I always enjoyed meeting new people rather good or bad it was always an experience.
good,Aarons was once a good place to work for but with the addition of a dishonest assistant regional it quickly went downhill. At Aaron's and really most rent to own company's there is not much of a work life balance at all when your average night runs to 9pm. Collections processes are ran legally and honestly but that kind of work can leave you feeling a little less than human. I did however enjoy working with the people. I had great customers and excellent employees.
good,"The only great thing about this job was the job security. The schedule was never the same and there were always times where we may not of had the tools to complete our duties,"
good,My experience at Aaron's was mixed. The customers are the greatest part of the job. They become more like friends than customers. At store level this is a great company with great employees but as you get into the regional management you tend to find the abusive individuals who tend to forget that they are in a position that demands the utmost professionalism.
good,This is a very reputable company who prides itself on its customer service and giving people the chance to build their credit while making timely montly payments on their merchandise in order to eventually obtain ownership of their product.
good,"Aaron's was ok until certain tasks wasn't performed by one person who wanted it to benefit for them only, working with one person is ok until they try to dictate your performance. Managers on the other hand do somewhat of their jobs but for me I did have one great General manager and two great associates."
good,Very challenging. There are many strong leaders in the company. The constant change in company direction created a few challenges in 2019. The most enjoyable part of my time has been leading  a great region of GMs.
good,"There was very little room for advancement and one time I was told I got the biggest raise in our region after exceeding goals 99% of the time and it was a whopping 56 cents after over a year 🙃 There is no kind of maternity or paternity leave. If you don’t work tons of over time then pto was slow coming in and even when you did it still wasn’t great. It was a lot of work for not enough money. I did like the manager there though, he was always great with his customers"
good,"the job itself wasn't bad at all. if youre into lifting furniture and heavy things, then go for it. it's typically an 8 hour work day and the job is fairly simple"
good,The work days at the location I worked aren't for everyone. Also no one likes to get much work done leading to lots of mistakes with no one to blame for. Overall not a bad job to have for a few years while a person figures things out. Not a place to get a career!
good,They took all of your time to work there. 7am to 9pm daily.  No balance between work and home life. Managers had to always be there from open to close daily.
good,"Great job, but horrible management & organization. Definitely was learning experience.                                                    "
good,"Great opportunity for sales minded people. Goals and standards are fair and achievable. Management is flexible and had a family first attitude. Other than the abrupt manner of collections, a good company."
good,Ok job just need sumthing better great manager cant keep a good sales manager hours are ok no overtime ok benefits ok vacation time friendly customers
good,"On a typical day at work you are responsible for hitting standards along with an abundance of non tangibles that must be performed.  Unfortunately I learned that some of the Aarons leaders do not care that you are understaffed or have a staff that was poorly trained before you arrived. You're not given any support when the demands of the job require more staffing and or staffing with the skill sets to do the job accurately. They could care less if you inherited a huge mess from prior management. The expectation is that when you are a general manager you have to have the ability to become 5 people at one time. You have to be able to correct mistakes of other employees that you don't know exist yet. You can reach out for help and all you will get is an answer that goes around the problem. If you have the right leadership in front of you, that is not overly burdened him or herself, you can do your job effectively with their support. If you don't get that opportunity, you are pretty much walking on eggshells with your job dangling over your head at every interval. All in all, with proper leadership and support, Aaron's would be a great place to work. With the wrong leadership you are told basically that you have to live at work, putting in 60 plus hours a week on most occasions, and basically get scolded when you take off 2 days in a months time. I've had some good experiences and some bad with this company. I reckon it becomes luck of the draw when you get into a store that is managed by someone who is competent, knowledgeable and supportive. Yes, there is some bitterness here."
good,"The work days were long which didn't leave much time for outside life but the pay was decent and the work environment was fun and close knit because there aren't a lot of employees so you really gain a bond with them,"
good,I like working for Aarons but I'd rather go work at corporate office and I wish they paid more money. I really wish I could find something else paying more money.
good,rent to own industry is very competitive and demanding. pay not great for the amount of hours required to be successful. typical day is a lot of calls and field visits.
good,"The regional manager was very supportive and available, however, the store manager was a nightmare to work with. She brought personal issues to work at times and the policy towards different accounts were case by case. Such as, one of her ""long time"" customers that she had a personal friendship with was allowed more lenient payment options when compared to other accounts."
good,A day at Aarons consist of coming in at 8 making phone calls to collect revenue due to the store on a monthly basis. Opening the store at 10 for business. It's a very fun loving atmosphere that can be tough at times when you're dealing with people.
good,"I worked at arrons warehouse a few years ago.  Picked up the job to supplement my income and make ends meet.  I left cause working 2 full time jobs was just too much.  I wasn't very found of management.  They were a couple and both moody all the time and would take their stress out on the employees.  We were working a skeleton crew of about 6 guys and they were never happy with our progress.  We'd all be covered in sweat from trying to keep up to their demand and it was never enough.  If the place had more people it would have been an okay job.  But being short handed, you were expected to lift refrigerators that we're stacked by yourself while unloading and fighting large furniture.  I'd also constantly get yelled at for not wearing my arrons shirt that I had never received.  When trying to explain they had never supplied me them, they'd tell me well when it does come in I need to wear it.  Never did see those shirts.  I'm sure it could have been an okay job, but it was just too much for a second job.  They ask too much of you, and injuries were bound to happen the way my warehouse was being ran."
good,"Exhausting schedule 8:00 am to 9:00 pm, Saturday 7:30 to 5:00 pm starting with around 500 collection calls, to end the day knocking at doors to collect money or re-possess the merchandise."
good,Working condition were good. Fast pace environment. New business coming down the line. Enjoy working with the employees and managers. The new business is great
good,"it was an okay company to work for, never really had a set schedule and wasn't allowed overtime at all. You do more work than you get paid for in my opinion"
good,"Unless you are great with people, I would not recommend working here. The hours made it hard for me to have a life outside of work. The commission does not make up for the low pay."
good,"steady pace job majority was mental and mathematical stress but a very great experience, overtime and going beyond for company was not appreciated but still a great opportunity for myself to learn"
good,it can get irritated delivering furniture and then got to go back to get them like a month later and got to clean them and then got to deliver them again
good,"Work too many hours, lack of bonuses and does not match pay. Now open on holidays we should be spending with family. Little opportunity for advancement"
good,Even though I wasn't paid the best salary the job was fun got to meet lots of people. I was able to support myself my girl & a son with that money so it wasn't all bad. I just loved the freedom of not being confined to an office or a desk all day.
good,"I conducted all deliveries, pick ups and services for the south end customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team I worked with however the hours were long."
good,It was a great experience to work here on account of meeting new customers and helping out with ideas to help fulfill their homes and their needs in life.
good,"working from 9 am - 9 pm, for just over minimum wage 5 or 6 days a week. Unsafe, unsanitary work conditions at times while in customer homes. No pay increase for over 3 years,and guilt tripped when you try to take vacations or time off. No room for advancement once you hit middle management."
good,"fast paced, driving from one town to another, some times carrying big pieces of merchandise alone. the hardest part is getting home too late for my 4 year old son, I am missing too much with him. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and getting a raise, but they tell me that I cannot go any higher in my wages per hour."
good,"Long hours, breaks was in with driving the company vehicle including no lunch or dinner breaks at times. No advancement, manager friends with employees not a boss. Pay was a little low for the things I do for the job{ irrate customers,solo deliverys, solo collections, fumes from sprays in back of truck etc...}"
good,"Very stressful and fast paced. A lot to learn to do job. Pay not great. People don""t seem to stay long.  Not many chances for advancement.. Long hours."
good,I am a desperately looking for a job that requires evenings and weekends. My schedule is flexible. I have a very outgoing personality and can assist customers bilingual in Spanish. I am very reliable and Guarantee to be an asset to your company. I want willing to accept constructive criticism as well. I strive to deliver quality customer service.
good,"Aarons was an ok job, it was steady paycheck and not very hard work. You will come into contact with roaches and bed bugs, so if that sort of thing bothers you, dont bother applying for them."
good,a good place to start but unwilling to pay any real money unless you devote 7+ years an become part of the club. if you bring up a problem that is not in there immediate best interest then it is overlooked.
good,I use to love my job until management changed over and the new manager just doesn't know how to run a business.  I would have stayed had it not been for that.
good,an ok place to work. benfits were good but pay was not up to par for the physical demand placed on me.loved getting to drive around to new places.management let store employees be lazy
good,Good people to work for but the hours and the pay isn't worth it. It has a good vibe in store but upper management is micro managing everyone below them
good,"This is a company that will give you a great start into learning different aspects of a business. The pay isn't bad at all once you are a general manager. However, store level associates usually do not make as much as one would think. The problem most gm's have that I have noticed is the work/life balance given you work usually 60+ hours a week and usually 6 days a week there's not much time for anything else outside of there. Also, there's never much consideration for the employees either. Yes, there's training but predominantly it's a sink or swim atmosphere with very little loyalty to one another."
good,"Love the current general manager and what employees we do have...very under staffed and makes hard for the stores performance..You have to have a strong work ethic and be ready to work very hard,long hours and feel unappreciated.Iv worked my butt off and have went far and beyond still no raise a year later or feel appreciated for sticking around and pressing forward...A single young person with no family or litlle responsibility will work out great here.I love my customers,co workeworkers and the company..that comes from my strong work ethic but it gets stressful thats a fact..overall my co workers,determined to grow my store and customers is why I have stuck it out."
good,The company experience really depends on where you work and who you work with. My experience was positive for the most part. I learned a lot of things about furniture that I actually would have never guesses I didn't.
good,"Fun company to work for. Lots of cool incentives and promotions that change monthly.  Hard environment for a sales person however. Very limited market, and requires a certain customer base which is hard to find in our area. Lots of leg work and long hours for decent pay. Overall not a bad company depending on your role."
good,It was a good place to work. You can be promoted quickly if you do your job and show that you want to advance. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and the long work weeks away from home.
good,"Ensuring customers received quality service during their search for affordable home furniture and electronics. My first day I learned people come for more than just great furniture they also like talking to friendly and helpful people who can steer them in the right direction for all of their needs. My management team was phenomenal they assisted me with building my confidence and trained me on all of the necessary skills that I would need to become the top performer in my department. The hardest part of the job was collections hearing the customers stories and applying a certain level of empathy took a lot of coaching, but I learned to be assertive and empathetic while finding alternative solutions and setting up payment options. The most enjoyable part of the job was also the connections with the repeat customers building rapport with them and seeing them refer friends and family."
good,"Very physically demanding work depending on your position. Co workers give help when needed."
good,delivering furniture and fixing stuff in the back returning furniture that hasn't been paid on clean it then sell it then repeat my coworkers are fun and cool to be around we have a great time at work the hardest part of my job is going into peoples house to deliver or return furniture and their house isn't clean the most enjoyable part of my day is playing games on my lunch break
good,"This is a retail company first, not a Transportation company. Drivers are great. Managers here are great. Benefits are good."
good,The job was decent. Hours were just too long. Not a great job/work life balance. Co workers were great. Felt like a family
good,"· To manage the store daily operations "
good,"Time management is essential, always takes care of its customers, sometimes fails to take care of its employees. Consistent work past scheduled hours, poor work/life balance"
good,"essentially, you would make +300 calls in the AM, then run your route for past-due clients to retrieve money/merch. Go to lunch, than rinse and repeat"
good,"This job kept me challenged and motivated, but I grew tired of the long hours every week. I enjoyed working and developing customer relationships and handling overall issues."
good,Coming in as a young person without a family the company offers great opportunity.  Training is excellent and local management is very knowledgeable.
good,"Typical day I would come in, and take care of my range of tasks, however, after picking up an advancement to a manager position, the company wouldn't pay for the increase in work and responsibility. "
good,"During my time working, I was pregnant. My manager was a 21 year old inconsiderate individual who was discriminating against me. I was expected to lift and carry merchandise over 20lbs. "
good,"•	Managed a team of drivers, to assure all merchandise be delivered in a timely manner."
good,"The store I work at  has nice people, upper Management are really cool people. There is room to grow with the franchise I work for. The benefits aren't great. but where are they great anymore."
good,"come into work, prepare merchandise required for deliveries and have supervisor confirm deliveries. Load the truck then go out on the road and deliver the items to customer homes."
good,"I worked there 9 years so it must not have been all bad. I love the people that work there and there is a real team atmosphere at the store level. The hours are horrible working till 9 most nights. No consistent schedule, Some days you will work 8am to 9pm and then other days you will work 4pm to 9pm. Company management only focuses on the negative, all interactions will focus on any areas that are lacking and will completely ignore the areas you are doing well. Even when performing consistenly way above company average in a category you are still made to feel like you could be replaced if you do not improve."
good,"Customer Service Rep, Cashier, unload truck, kept showroom up."
good,I put over 100% of myself into my work.  My success  is based on my personal goals to achieve the maximum I can towards company goals.  I have worked for this company for many years from when it was owned by a franchise to being a corporate store.  The company standards are consistent and achievable.  The other managers I work with have also been working long term.  Employee retention is at a higher rate than most companies.  I enjoy teaching my crew how to succeed themselves and achieve great things within this company.  The challenges are making all customers happy with the service and results we provide at our store.
good,Learned how to up load updates and repair laptops. My co-workers where a very hard working group. It was very difficult moving furniture up stairs.I did enjoy helping the customers with their needs.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the customer retention portion, the finding customers that had moved, and the thrill of the hunt."
good,"As a store manager you have a lot duties to perform. You have to sell, collect, manage your inventory, make sure goals are met, and oversee your staff.  What I learned from this company is like running your own business. Every month when we had a managers meeting reviewing profit and loss statements of the stores in the district I always looked to improve on things to be at the top or near the top. This was a valuable learning experience for me. Management was pretty good, but my direct supervisor was not a team player. As a team leader he rarely visted my store, which there was little need because i was always above company standards in profit, but when I did call upon him he wasn't there for me. I had staffing issues at my store and he wouldn't give me the help I needed which led to me working six days a week, 12-14 hours, for six months.The divisonal managers overall were pretty good. I had some pretty good co-workers, most were really helpful when you needed them. The hardest part of my job was staffing issues. The most enjoyable part was the quarterly bonuses for your hard work."
good,"I worked there for almost a year before i was considered to receive a raise. The raise never happened, The job security was not there and the long hour made it difficult to spend time with my family. This company will not last if they so not look at their business practices."
good,"My primary issue with this job was management.  I was treated with disrespect and had to stand face to face with customers while on the phone with my boss and I had to apologize to the customer for my boss lying to them.  I was sent on multiple trips to the same houses to pick up peoples furniture because they were lied to in the store and they were not satisfied with what items they received due to damage, stains or the price.  Otherwise the job was pretty cool.  Imagine playing Tetris with a lot more blood sweat and tears.  Every delivery is a new puzzle."
good,Too many problems in a place without respect for its customers or employees.
good,"It's a great company to work for, The rewards can be great,you have to start from the very bottom in order to recieve the handsome perks, but in the accounts department you have no quality of life because the hours are long. 8am-9pm mon.-fri. and saturdays 7:30am -6pm. I did enjoy working with the employees and the customers. It was wonderful hands on training on the operation of leasing merchandise and the bonuses you recieved when you hit your goal for the month were decent as well."
good,"Want to move on do someting ,better and that I can move up ladder"
good,"I would come in & stock. then i would pack items on truck to deliver. i would deliver items to specified customers, and assist them in putting together furniture."
good,"If your working in the call center you can expect to be on the phones non stop on most days.  It used to be a fun place to work but over time the policies began to make it unbearable.  If you like overtime then you will find a lot of it available.  You are routinely asked to stay late or come in on Saturdays or work holidays.  Management has a tendency to try and micro manage and as a result over complicates a lot of processes.  "
good,"Collections, and delivery of merch... Aarons is a great place o work just looking for a long term position"
good,"If you enjoy the Rent to Own Business, then this is for you. If you are easy going the accounts department is not for you. Hours are long, so you don't have a chance to get other things done in a day. The employees are great, but customers can be a headache"
good,"Typical work hours are 8-9 and you must have a strong work ethic to keep up with the needs of the occupation.  Customer service oriented and must be great with acheiving daily, weekly and month sales goal company wide."
good,"worked day is helping costomers pay their bills and make new sales answering the phone, my co-workers in the most part are great but a few that would do anything to advance even talk behind your back. most enjoyable part of my job is the costumers. hardest part is dealing with the regional manager"
good,"-A typical day at Aaron's consist of filing paper work, answering phone calls, helping with customer inquiries, and running the sales floor."
good,"This job is good at first, but when you realize that Aaron's does not care about your personal life things get ""personal,"" The pay is competitive the hours are competitive, but in the long run Aaron's does not care whether you stay with them or leave. Management changes too frequently plenty of opportunities to advance yes! Also plenty of opportunities to be terminated. 6 months working with the company i have went through 4 General managers two of which were fired one demoted and the other moved. This company worries too much about the customers rather than their own sweat and blood. (the employees)"
good,"A typical day at work involved the full accounts payable cycle, from opening the mail to cutting the checks. I learned the full AP cycle. Management was firm but fair. The hardest part of the job was processing expense reports without proper back up. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the AP cycle."
good,It's an ok company to work for. The long hours make it hard to have a life outside of work.
good,"Aaron's is a wonderful company, they stive to be the best in the rent to own business. A typical day includes making collection calls, process payments, obtaining and matianing customers, feild visting customers, paperwork for accounts that must go to our boss,manage and train co-workers while still being productive in the accounts office. I have been part of the Aaron's team since I graduated from Lander University but as of recent I have been called names such as ""Darkie and black guy"" which forced me to find a better career else where."
good,Traning staff on new product. Watch store functions and make inprovements.
good,9-9
good,This an ok place to work. Management needs improvement and there needs to more ethical practice
good,"hard work everyday, plenty of oppurtunity to advance. your not stuck behind a desk all day. you get to meet a wide range of people some great some crazy"
good,"It’s a great place to get experience and start your career! Competitive pay for an entry level position but the pay for upper level positions is not as competitive. Also, still a little old school and needs to catch up with the modern company culture."
good,"No help and hard work , I was advised job requires some loading and loading with assistance, I do most the loading and unloading with little to n9 assistance"
good,"I entered as a sales manager. The title should say service, sales,and operations manager. My sales team was always hitting goal and beating corporate numbers."
good,"I really would not like to dicuss my time at aaronsv, because i went through some troubling times during that time period which results in my personal review"
good,Maintain a daily log. Maintain inspection of the truck each day before driving. Pick up money from customers and return it to the store. Load up the truck with appliances and delivered it.
good,Good place to work if you are competitive and like to meet monthly goals. If goals are met your are generously compensated.Long hours made it very hard to have a home life.
good,You are responsible for many different responsibilities. Very fast paced environment but there is a lot of opportunity to move up. The downside is that you spend most of your life here.
good,The quality of the job is based almost entirely on the scheduling and managment of the store. When the team is well taken care of the store thrives and is a great place to work.
good,"The Manager at the time was very unprofessional and disrespectful. Didn’t know how to train nor coach. I was put in this store to learn the other side of management from a Sales Manager  perspective. OMG, was this the wrong store.  The store didn’t know anything about diversity. It was always pour and bitter jester about race. I felt very uncomfortable!! The pay was horrible! Every other rental company pays way more than Aaron’s!"
good,"not the worst company to work for , but the management is horrible  it is pretty much every person for themselves so it really does teach you about being independent"
good,"ok job, the pay wasn't great & you rarely had time for family but all in all it was okay. They should work on pay for employees and also ways to work with people when/if they were unable to come to work because if this happened, you were not really able to make it up."
good,Overall great company depending on the area you work in and who you work under. Sales manager is the lowest paying position but is the operation of the store. Be careful because although you bust your butt they still will bring someone else in over you
good,"Good place to work how every the store was in a bad locations, so it was very hard to get outside sales some we had to hit to streets marketing every day."
good,"I think I worked with the best team at Aaron's, but all the stores in the area seemed to be equally as nice. We were like family. We had fun while working, while still making sure the customers were taken care of. I worked for the company for 3 years and never got a raise from the 10 dollars I started with, which is the main reason I left. I don't have any children, and that amount of pay couldn't sustain me. I can't imagine how hard it was for my co-workers with families."
good,Never know how you're day is going to go. The management team is just ok it depends of how good and positive the are with costumer service. The jobs is hard wen you dont have good team work. The best part is getting to know the good costumers.
good,Theh could really be more conciderate of the coustomer i will say they do offer what most will not a chance to prove your self i believe with the right people they will be good
good,"As a delivery driver, we get paid decently, but it's not enough to improve life. If you live bare minimum or have roommates, then this is a great job. If you're trying to start a family or build a life for yourself, you can do better. Good luck getting promoted, especially as a driver. Over a year, and they still won't promote me."
good,Aaron's is a good overall company. The issue is with management depending where you work. In Texas management was great & followed company guidelines in FL not as focused.
good,could have had more help with moving furniture rather then my partner sitting in the truck most of the time and hade me do all the work. but i really like the other people i worked with.
good,"Fun place to work, Enjoyable people and the customers friendly. Was important to keep people happy. Fun to call potential clients inviting them to events."
good,"Stressful at times, however you must have the drive to be a sales person. If the sales goals are not met it affects possible commission that could be earned and must maintain a certain number of customers quarterly."
good,"Although the salary potential was very high, the work/ home life balance were not good. General managers were expected to work until the job was complete no matter the effect on the home life. Positions below general manager were somewhat on the lower scale. Management less than supportive in some cases"
good,"Good place to learn about products. Very relaxed environment. Long hours worked.  Good benefits, but compensation has room for improvement as compared to other companies."
good,The only real bad thing I can say about Aaron's furniture this is way too slow paced you have to wait for customers to come in and you may only see 3 to 10 customers a day in a 9 hour shift other than that if your delivery driver your day goes by pretty fast and it's pretty fast-paced in that sense
good,"Depending on who you manager is I'm sure it can be a great experience or a poor one. Good job. decent pay when you first start, but when you start to get multiple duties added to your position with no pay compensation it sucks"
good,You learn as you go there are training workshops that can be useful however this industry is a dying breed due to where the market has shifted in terms of non credit.
good,Loved it at first then it slowly unfolded and started to show that you can’t be too careful of who’s to trust it’s has a family feel to the place and it can be fun but it becomes a second home. If you don’t have kids or important things to care for outside of work this is the place to be management versus on who you are given. Sometimes it works well in your favor sometimes it don’t
good,"It is a great place to start a career,  and some of the co-workers were great but, there were some places they fell short of being a well ran business."
good,"This is a fast-paced, high volume company. There was a management change during my tenure and the styles were evident.We never had an issue with any employees."
good,I enjoyed working with all the other employees and meeting new people on a daily basis. It was a competitive environment at the same time because their were goals that had to be met by the end of each month
good,Not a bad company to work for. Very unorganized with it comes to different levels of management. A lot of hours for really no reason at all. Upper management don't really care about the lower level employees
good,"The only thing that has kept me with Aaron's is the salary & benefits, other than the clientele."
good,You will work long hours!!! Not much time for anything else in this job. the pay could be better to compensate for the time you put in for this company.
good,weird work hours typical business where they pay and treat employees like they don't matter no matter how long you've worked there or what you've done for the company
good,"it is a good company to work for, but working 45+ hours a week and bringing home $550 every other week is not worth it anymore. Too many hours and not enough pay. "
good,A typical day of work at Aaron's was come in at 8am and load the product that the customers ordered the day before and get read to deliver after a morning meeting to find out what the work day consist of. Even though we had to sing a song every Friday for camaraderie it still felt like there was tension and miss communication. The hardest part of the job was trying to get furniture and heavy appliances into small apartments and up narrow stairwells. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the product and what was new with technology in the laptops and doing events in the store for memorial day and forth of July ect.
good,"It can be challenging, but overall it's either for you or it isn't. When it is, it can be rewarding."
good,It is very hard to work here if you have a family. However they will work with you as much as possible. It was not a horrible place just very time consuming.
good,"This was a fairly ok job. Pay was ok, work schedule needed improvement. There wasnt alot of time to have a life outside of workplace (family time). It did help pay the bills & supported the family."
good,If you like seeing a friendly face in customers always work to be done you constantly moving you'll get a workout from all the deliveries you do and if you like to travel on the road this the job for you.
good,"The hours are long and leave a lot of an opportunity for outside activities aside from days off. For the amount of work demanded and cliental that we're forced to work with, the pay is horrendous."
good,working for aarons is ok. great benefits but no balance between work and home. In my opinion it can be extremely time consuming. when in management it does not leave much time for home
good,"If you are a self motivated, hard worker then you can succeed at Aaron's.  You will be working continuously with the public and will get to know most of your customers on a first name basis. So having an open personality would help."
good,"To learn all inventory, advertise merchandise, to keep show room floor clean and tidy at all times. to create order forms accurately. to order Merchandise as needed. etc"
good,"A day in the life of a Product Technician involves operating a box truck or van sized vehicle, lifting merchandise varying in weight up to a couple hundred pounds. You must keep track of all stops on your route, as well as take care of the customer while you are out and about. The physical aspect of the job can be intimidating to some, however for myself the difficulties depend on how your team works. If you have a group of people who are willing to run to a problem, and fix it rather than stray away from a problem, then you will most likely have a great experience. I've worked for 2 different stores in my career with Aaron's, the first store was sore-filled with drama, and people who would rather place blame on others than work to fix an issue. The second store was filled with people who were constantly trying to work towards a goal that benefited not only themselves but the entire store. If there was slack, it was dealt with. "
good,Straightforward job with decent medical coverage and hours. Franchise store so owners management may vary. Lots of on the road time and freedom at work.
good,They pay decently when you start but don't adjust your wage when they adjust the starting wage so eventually the new employees will make more than you.
good,"No chance of growth/ You were sales, delivery, set up of furniture. The hardest part of the job was time. The best part of the job was delivery. A typical day started at 9.00 am and finish at 8 or 9 pm. Deliveries, cleaning Machines, set up displays, inventory,"
good,"Aaron's provides little work life balance in the accounts side, working mainly 8 AM to 9 PM Monday through Friday and 8 AM to 5 PM on Saturdays. The insurance that is offered is better then a lot of companies, and they do have a decent paid time off plan."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Aarons.  I learned a lot and worked it an awesome and talented group of DBAs."
good,Poor upper managment but fun to work for at the store level. Need to adjust goals and standards to account for variances in store sizes. Easy to obtain valuable customer servcie experience.
good,"Very unsafe environments, poor management and mean clients and customers. I don't get the support I need for my supervisor and I am giving way to many job duties at once"
good,"Terrible work environment! It is always unorganized, you have no help. Merchandise is always breaking down and be prepared to resell ""Roach"" infested merchandise that gets returned from customer homes."
good,"Performance based advancement is great, you can go as far as you want as quickly as you want. The other side to that is the higher you go the worse the Life Balance / Job Work gets."
good,"Business to business marketing, conducted meetings each week, telemarketing to increase new customers, collected on pass due accounts. Ordered and controlled inventory. Controlled payroll (overtime)."
good,As a Manager Trainee there is no actual manager training or skills required .Basically your a collections agent helping people keep their account on track.
good,"A typical day to work its make your task as well you can, on my experience I do my day to day assignment as well I can. I learn the culture work in a ware house."
good,"Set business up for the day open doors, get cash drawer, take bank deposit. I learned different ways to market and how to manage delinquent accounts. The people are what make the company. It is a physically demanding job."
good,Working for Aarons was always fun. i met new people everyday. had wonderful benefits. I learned how to repair many appliances and other merchandise. all of my co workers were unique cool and different. the hardest part about working for Aarons was that the AC didn't work in the warehouse but we made the best of it.
good,"Day to day operations of client accounts by reviewing or updating their files."
good,Big companies see you as what you can do for them. To me it seemed as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Dead end job. Hardly and advancement. The people making the big money ain't going anywhere. You just seem stuck. I was there for almost 8 years
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was helping every customer find everything they were looking for and making sure they were happy by the time they walked out of the store.
good,"Would occasionally travel to other stores to assist with management. "
good,"This is a job that took up 12 hour days and challenged one to have an organized life. Going out of your way for customers was very common and it was a good customer based environment, however they did not respect and take care of their own employees. Promotions were selective and not appropriately based off of qualifications. Co workers were great most of the time, management was more of a watch them work instead of getting involved and helping their store and workers. For example the manager has his ""team"" do his job. Lunches were often cut short and not allotted the time that was supposes to be allowed."
good,"I am responsible for collecting payments on customer accounts.  This is not always easy but I have learned a lot about how to effectively communicate with people who are not happy to be speaking to you.  The most difficult aspect of the job is breaking people of poor spending habits that they have developed throughout their entire life.  However, getting them to break these habits and start making their payments on time is highly rewarding.  Management at Aarons could definitely be more structured in their efforts to lead.  Further, a higher emphasis should be placed on employees work/life balance."
good,"Aaron's is a quickly growing company. The result is that there is ample opportunity for promotion, but little professional support for those who have recently been promoted. Stores can be run by either highly professional and talented individuals, or by individuals promoted out of lack of options. The latter tends to stay very short periods of time and leave stores in complete disarray and chaos. "
good,Enjoyed getting my customers the things they needed or wanted and seeing them happy.
good,"I would show customers the different items we had to offer, take payments, call about late payments, and clean."
good,"It will be difficult to leave this place, but it is time for a change in my life. My co-workers are like family to me and I will miss the regular customers."
good,"A normal day would include calling customers about their agreements, placing furniture on the sales floor, taking payments, counseling customers, deliveries, & cash counting. Hardest part of this job was the lack of work/home balance as I was working from 7am- 8pm Monday -Saturday. The most enjoyable part would have to be meeting & developing relationships with new people daily."
good,"Aarons is a very culture driven business, which means that there is a good amount of repetition. There are certain things that are done daily such as opens, various reports, graphs, and even certain conversations. Learning to work in a cultured environment is a good thing as there are many tasks that must be accomplished daily. "
good,"Females need not apply. You are brought in at the same wage as your PT's and expected to pretty much do everything. I was brought in at $3 less per hour than my male counterparts in other stores. The hours are long (45 hours per week) and if you come in as a newbie and you are over CSR's...you get no respect. It was ok while it lasted..but I will say, if you're ok with going to pick up furniture from trashy residences then this may be the job for u. I wasnt impressed at all. This was a dirty, unorganized and unpleasant place to work"
good,"reported directly to  the GM. You  play a vital role in the team’s success by managing the store’s sales and marketing function. With the goal of bringing the customers one step closer to ownership.  As well as collecting revenues and protecting company assets. Required to act as a customer counselor by discussing benefits of timely lease agreement renewal payments. Contact customers directly who have not paid their Lease agreement(s). Responsible for the delivery, shipping and receiving of store merchandise as well as keeping an accurate inventory of every item."
good,"My day started at 8 am sharp, calling our Non-renewals, and collecting payments. At 10 am our store would open, and it was time to greet customers, and sell! Managed the daily delivery's and made sure that the delivery trucks where loaded with the proper merchandise to get delivered to our customers. Maintained the sales associates and delivery drivers, also our collections department to ensure that everything was functioning properly. "
good,I just feel as I want to be apart of a company where I see potential growth.
good,"assisted in opening store,learned collection of accounts,co-workers were fun to work with,hardest part of job was taking customers merchandise,most enjoyable was customer service"
good,my review will reflect my same views as with previous employment
good,"I work from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm 4 days a week and 8-5 one day a week. "
good,"• Communications with DOR"
good,"As a general manager you work 55 hours plus a week.  Meaning, you have no family life and no time for anything else."
good,I get to work with 6 other people that are fun and exciting to be around.  The customer base of over 600 clients also helps keep things entertaining.  I love working with my customers on their accounts and selling them new merchandise.  The hardest part of the job is probably the collections side and getting customers to pay in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable part is selling new and existing customers new merchandise and seeing the excitement on their faces.
good,I enjoyed working with the public. co-workers were hard to get along with. loved the pay and benefits
good,"I enjoyed working for Aarons, but I also figured out it is not the place for me. I got to experience a merchandising perspective, and though it was fun and a learning experience, it really isn't something I want a career doing."
good,I loved my job and working with customers. Management had poor ethics. There is no job security and what applies to you might not apply to other co workers. The hardest part of my job was meeting our goals. I was a sales person and sometimes customers just wasn't buying. The best part of my job was working with some good people and the customers. I got to try out alot of different electronics and see all the new ones come in.
good,"I did like working for Aaron's, but the store that I was given was in trouble and I came in to fix it. I was working over 70 hours a week. The regional management staff has been in place for a long time and there was limited advancement."
good,"it is a nice place to work, my coworkers are nice and easy to work with."
good,Well at my current area workplace is a nightmare. Our original company was bought out and basically had to start over from scratch as if being rehired. Losing all the benefits of vacation and paid sick time so you were left out to dry. Management half the time don't know what they are talking about meaning they say one thing to a customer then go back on their word. If you try to take off for a day they get upset.
good,"I do believe that many locations are different however, I do feel that things could have been ran more professional. I was afforded great opportunites and met some terrific people."
good,Alot better environment than working at a plant. Employees are alot closer and tend to depend on each other more for support other than doing it alone
good,"In my current role as Contracts Support Administrator, I interact with the client of Marks and Spencer daily, the building currently holds over 350 members of staff which I communicate and interactive with daily, ranging from the M&S building manager to the head of cleaning.  I work within a small but busy team of 6, I am very much a team player but can complete tasks independently when required."
good,They pay needs to be better for the work that you will be doing some of the places you go to deliver are in small areas and not only do you half to worry about doing deliveries you also half to worry about driving a truck.
good,"A good place to work for a job, but the economy and strategic planning makes a career opportunity very skeptical to wait around for. There are plenty of ideal training videos, but they only work for a certain culture and the rest is basically adapting to your environment."
good,"Being able to deliver,set up,serviced and/or picked up the merchandise around the Hampden County along with parts of CT, Palmer and other various areas in Massachusetts"
good,"Management needs a lot of work on how to treat employees and customers , and not mix personal life with work. "
good,My review was great had a great interview. I wish job paid more for what the job intells it's very hard labor to do. But management is very great to work for.
good,had alot of problems with management and them having me do there personal errands and chores instead of store job duty's other then that the staff i worked with were awesome
good,"I like to repair electronics but most of my work is spent on the computer doing the paperwork for the repairs.  It is low stress and the pay is ok, but not great."
good,The job wasn’t too hard but it was a tad bit overwhelming when they wanted you to do more than 5 things at the same time. They asked for too much of you for such little pay. And you can tell when the boss was having a bad.
good,"To work at Aaron's, one must be focused, detail oriented, and self efficient. There are different software programs that would be helpful in many areas/industries. The most enjoyable part of the job is the occasional holiday party."
good,"A typical day would entail delivery orders to customers as they were given to myself. Also, handling billing and collection runs. However, the cleanliness throughout the store was looked over."
good,"Been doing repairs for a long time it was a great placed . Great pay ,  service van got everything I needed to do my job traveling to all the store that Aaron’s has it was nice and fun"
good,"Aaron’s is an ok job to work for a feed years, there isn’t a lot of advancement for workers trying to move up. Pay is underwhelming, work schedule is not flexible at all."
good,Learned vital information of manual labor and sales technique very balanced with schedule and routine days effectively handled factory and warehouse merchandise
good,"Long hours and high expectations. Sometime the expectations are unrealistic. The company is not a bad company, but the pay isn't great and working 45 to 50 or more hours per week, and working every weekend is not ideal if you are married or have kids."
good,Would not recommend it to anyone or a warm my friends they're very fair and treat employees like they do not matter so with that being said I would not recommend anyone to go to that
good,The company has its busy days and it's slow day but no matter the days you will always stay busy. The deliveries can be exhausting depending on the house/apartment. If your on the sales team you will have alot of calls to make an customer's to assist
good,"Aarons has a slow paced work feel and friendly co-workers. the slow pace allows for occasional tom foolery however when you are enacting your responsibilities the work is heavy lifting, clerical, or cleaning."
good,"It all begins at 9:50, preparing the store to be up and running for 10am. The atmosphere is very fast pasted, having a 850 customer count. Nearly interacting with 15% a day collecting payments, resolving nearly impossible customer issues to keep customers satisfied. Here multitasking needs to be a strong suit."
good,"It was a fun place to work, after they got a new manager it has definitely stepped it’s game up and offers everyone the best possible deals in town locally."
good,Enjoy learning new skills on a day to day basis. Aaron's is a company that values the dedication of its employees even throughout business transformation initiatives.
good,did what i needed to do to go home but did learn to do my job right and i do it with proud what i do on my job like that my boss will be happy with my duties on my job
good,This job I worked the longest. I was moved up from a delivery driver to upper management quick within 2 years of starting. I have nothing bad to say about this job but if you have a family and like spending time with family then this job wouldn’t be good.
good,"Aarons is a great company to be employeed with, they create high standards for their employees. I had the privilage to travel with this company nation wide."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Aarons, it has good culture and I had the pleasure of having some very good co-workers. It's retail though, so the hours are rough and advancement was rare."
good,great place to work and has helped me grow year after year through performance. The company has given me lots of opportunities over the years and continues to do so
good,"Good, a lot of benefits, employee price, you can always work for 40 hrs minimum every week, PTO, sick time,  from Monday to Saturday, but they want to start working"
good,"It’s an ok work place depending on who you work with, wages are horrible you’ll be lucky to make $13/hr as a manager, which with the amount of work you do it’s not worth it at all. Let alone it takes a long time just to get paid the first couple of months because there payroll staff take their sweet old time so you usually have to be paid out of the till at the end of the week, which isnt right."
good,When there is trouble from above then good people leave and bad people stay.  I wish them well and hope they are prosperous and good fortune shines on them all.
good,"Aarons was a very structured work place. As a first sales position, it was a great entry job that taught the basics of how to sell and advertise. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"good atmosphere, happy with the people that I work with and getting to know some of our customers. Very fast paced and never a dull moment. Only con I have is the hours of operation, which make sense for a sales company, but keeps me away from my son."
good,I really liked working there. The co workers and customers were great. I really believe I would still be there if it had not of been for me getting hurt
good,"Working at Aaron’s I have grown a lot in character, knowledge of sales and management. For the years I’ve been at Aarons I feel as a company we could have improved in job culture and job security."
good,"Career driven, Customer oriented, long days and hours. Stressful with little help from the senior management. I was able to meet their goals even with all the stress"
good,"long hours required, pa rate low for the required amount of work duties required no room for growth and not good benefits and very expensive benefits if chosen to opt in"
good,I loved my job and loved the people I worked with but the regional management team was not personable and that made for a very hostile working environment most of the time.
good,"you started the day by loading the truck, then you would start your delivery route until you was done for the day, after you was done with delivery's you would flip the floor for the next day"
good,management sucks. benefits are awesome. customers are awesome. management sucks. I've been asking about a promotion for over a year. and not once has anyone given me a straight answer on weather or not I'm ready for the job. my management hasn't given me the tools to learn more than what's expected of me. I feel used in my position.
good,"You start your day (from my store at least) at 9 or 10 and it ends at about 7 each night, later if you don't get what you need done. Fixed hours. One hour lunch at my store and if like me you lived a bit out of the way you're getting home at 8pm each night."
good,"I have worked under great leadership and also managers who seem to have a chip on their shoulder.   Currently when I hear from my boss that everythings changing and they are going to cut my hours and pay, and that I should find a new job it makes me concerned for the stability of my job.  I just got my three year recognition award and now I am not sure what to think. "
good,"This a goal orientated company, but is also pretty laid back. Upper management seemed approachable and would listen to what was being said. Communication was good."
good,Benefits and raises could be better OK working environment no continuous days off which makes the weeks long.Your virtually always short staffed which also drag because it’s hard to take vacations that way
good,Wasted 5 years of my life dealing with dumb people. Who didnt' know how to manage their credit and have the gull to get upset when we need to collect payment or pick up merchandise
good,"Days were very stressful due to not knowing how deliveries were going to go after being told the day before how they were supposed to be, Management was not great at all, very unorganized. The hardest part of the jiob was getting off late and having my kids home by themselves. Days off were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Delivery and pick up of appliances & other rental items. Assist in repair and cleaning of items to be re-rented. The hours are often irregular and days can exceed 8 hrs.
good,It was a good place to work. I learned alot and worked over 10 years there. The hardest part able working at aarons was driving in extreme weather but it all worked out.
good,Very good job and very fitness job lots of customer aerobics experience learning how to put things together and take them apart and learn electrical and plummbing
good,If your not great at sales or a valued employee your time with this company will be short lived. Turnover is extremely high due to poor interview skills and them jist needing a body to fill a space and holes to jist get them trained. Be aware stay away from this company
good,"Is good place if they only focus in business hour like 9-6 or 10-7. they always training that good, but they need to have more focus in their associates"
good,"In the accounts department I was able to work first hand with customers in resolving financial issue, budgeting, and finding products that were the perfect fit for them. My job was rewarding in helping people work through what was beat for them and finding a payment plan that fit in with their monthly expenses. My favorite part of my job at Aarons was my customers, they were what made the job what it was."
good,"It was a stressful place to work, the manager at the time was very unprofessional and had zero communication skills. He was rude and did not make the environment feel comfortable."
good,"stay very busy. work was steady , helped customers towards ownership and pay there payments on time. working customer service and manage my team to be succesful"
good,"For what was being paid the demand on the employees was too much. For example as a Manager Trainee ... I made 10.50/hr. The job entailed managing over 800 customer accounts, daily calls to customers, daily sales in store, delivery of lease product from time to time & actual collections"
good,Great place to work. friendly atmosphere overall. the wages are decent and they have great benefits. always was in a good place when I was working there
good,"Its a pretty good company as a hole to work for with good benifits and pay. Also, plenty of opportunities for a person to grow and move up within the company."
good,poor pay for hard work; advancement is sketchy but the money doesn't go up along with the responsibility; plenty of bonus incentives but a lot of them are dependent on a team effort
good,"Lot of turnover, lack of communication, dog eat dog environment.  Lot's of promises not kept.  Persons in all types of leadership roles treat employees as objects and there is no equality. There are different rules for hourly Employees."
good,"As the Customer Accounts Manager you are the store's second in command. In spite of this, you are still an hourly employee but are typically putting in 50-60 hours per week. Lots of pressure to ""hit your numbers"" with collections, and that places you in an adversarial position with most customers. Have a thick skin -- you're going to need it."
good,It was an ok place to work. No one really does their job. They just do parts of it. It's very laid back. The DM spends most of his day looking at women on facebook.
good,"I was working as a Product Tech, which is a delivery driver. I had to deliver furniture and appliances to customer's homes, which had a variety of situations to deal with. "
good,"Aarons is a retail & lease company. My experience with Aarons was great until the end when I got hurt. I had alot of fun and much success selling and leasing a verity of home goods such as appliances, computers, tv's and furniture. My only negative is management micro managed and did not take your suggestions or recommendations seriously."
good,"My role and position was contracted out to Velossent  llc so the pay was very low, and recruiting dept was created with all contractors."
good,I liked working at Aaron's but the hours for a General Manager are definitely not family friendly. This is a fast paced work place. you have to be great with people and have great selling skills. It was not a bad place to work the only reason I left was I needed more time with my family. I enjoyed working for my Regional Manager and the Smith group. They were down to Earth people and treated everyone with respect.
good,I worked for Aarons when it was a tough time to find a job. They tried to blame the falling of the business on the employees instead of the economy around us. Everyone around us were having the same issues as us.
good,"If you are not familiar with repo business, Aaron is very close to it with the difference of product leased. You lease a Bedroom set and if monthly pmt is to provided you go and reposes the bedroom set and bring it back to store and try to re-leased to next customer"
good,"The goal was to sell furniture"
good,Good company to work for. Good pay and good benefits. Paid vacations. Relaxed atmosphere and good people to work with. Competitive pay for type of job worked
good,Working at Aaron's was very stressful. If you worked in collections. Your job was to call customers about payments if they were late. If they didn't answer. You would make a house visit. If they couldn't pay. You would pick up the product.
good,"On any given day I help customer's with their online Ecom orders, or I help the file a formal complaint from the store they are currently leasing from.  I think the hardest part is that most of the stores don't know about the online process and tell the customer anything, which makes it hard for us to explain the correct procedures.  I like talking to different people through out the day, makes it enjoyable."
good,"I came I saw I did.. higher management team is a joke, that do not follow through with there promotion promises, they would rather hire from outside companys."
good,calling past due accounts  bank depost   selling merchandice field visiting past due customers taking payments training assocites doing schedules loading trucks
good,I would sweep floor dust the appliances clean counter tops answer phones or assist with caring heavy items or greet people as they walk in And it was a great job experience in while looking for a career
good,I actually like the job and was good at it. I just didn't care for the company. They didn't pay well and had an open distrust for their Employees. Too bad
good,"The Regional Manager is very involved with the employees, he cares about their input and views of the store. He is very involved with the way the stores are being ran.  Most of all, there is never a dull moment, your co-workers become like family.  Everyone is there to help each other to accomplish the stores goals as a whole.  But every place of employment has its up and downs."
good,"The only bad part about working here was the long days, and more than 50 hour work weeks which gives you no time to hang with family or really do anything outside of work."
good,"Not a terrible place to work. Decent income. There are long hours to ensure you meet your monthly store goals, so be prepared for that. There are also difficult conversations that have to be had with customers."
good,At times can be a gun great place to work. At other times stressful with a hard work environment. Store manager and higher will beat you into the ground.
good,Aaron's provides its employers with plenty of opportunity for growth. The job is diverse and you will learn the in and outs pf the company. There are a lot of opportunity.
good,"Can sometimes be fast paced or slow, but no matter what you always have to be working and trying to get customers to walk in the door. 50+ marketing calls daily and organization/communication skills are a must!"
good,got along with everyone. had no problems while I worked there.  learned things about furniture and appliances I didn't know.  got to meet a lot of people who worked in their stores.
good,"people were friendly, got to meet lots of people, on a normal day I would be there at 7:50am to start calls by 8am  get calls done by 10am then go out into the field to collect money."
good,"Rent to own company that is very fast paced,  Long hours for management and lofty goals.  Bonus extremely hard to reach and is basically an hourly paid position."
good,"If the wages were raised just a little bit more I would definitely work for Aaron's again. "
good,this job came with many perks but it also came with a price.  ideal for someone without a family.  you can make good money with the company but you will not have much free time to enjoy life.
good,"Days were very long... Great company for a single person, I think that they should consider having a larger staff. They should also be mindful that individuals tend to burn out if overworked."
good,This is a job for a high school student that just graduated and is not sure what their next move is. They pay 9-10 an hour depending the location. If you have a family and bills this is not the job for you.
good,"this was a great place to work, between the other members of the team, the hours and the owners. the collections was the hardest part of the job. -----"
good,"If you put your best foot forward you can advance and make this into a career, however the work life balance and the hours are not the best.  The overall company provide great benefits."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making debt collection calls, completing inventory in a health hazardous warehouse, creating sales goals, building and staging furniture, repossessing furniture from non-paying customers."
good,Expect to work like a slave and you can't have a life outside of this job. Mangers don't last because of the high expectations.Don't expect to make much unless your a man.
good,"the job doesn't pay a lot, it's not hard work, it just the hours are til 7-7:30 at night. Management could be a little bit better than what it is. I've learned to do a little bit of accounting work while being employed"
good,"Can be fun at times, but the pressure of selling merchandise can be stressful. Customers who are behind on accounts can be rude, but it comes with the territory."
good,"Handle Customer Accounts issues. Responsibilities Communicate with customer to resolve product issues"
good,Making multiple phone calls to customers who need to pay on there account. Also field visit customers that we were not able to get in-touch with by phone. Managers would help to assits with customers and show how to talk to them in a better manner and making them feel welcome in the store.
good,typical day includes making sure showroom is clean setting up and installing table computers furniture electronics appliances and more deliver products to customers greet customers in store provide excelent customer service
good,The rent to own industry can be a task when having different caliber of customers. I enjoyed the day to day interaction with customers.  The hardest part of the job is been held responsible for customers who were not consistent with payments.
good,"Aarons has a good family feel to it from the store side. Store managers and associates have good communications from one location to the other. I believe the company takes pretty good care of store employees. On the corporate side I believe they are a little too comfortable and set in their ways. As times change, the need for company change is a must. Though a good company in general they seem to fear change and new ideas making goals of company growth unrealistic. "
good,"the work is fast paced, management can sometimes be inconsistent depending on where and who you work with, overall not the worst place to work and the money isnt terrible,"
good,The manager at the time I worked there was wonderful to work for. If there was something I needed help with he would take the time to explain or show me how to do it.
good,"Very long hours was the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of my job was working with the costumers. I learned a great deal about managing a store, different types of softwares, inventory and costumer service."
good,"Could have been better overall, things would often change alot and that is not what I was looking for in a job, I am looking for some consistency, in my jobs"
good,"Fun, productive and goal orient environment"
good,"A typical day is very tiresome at AARONS. They do not care about anything but numbers. The managers are awlful, I worked there for seven years, I couldn't tell you why I stayed that long."
good,it is a humbling experience. it barely pays your bills. My manager is great. i will definitely be looking elsewhere. it is absolutely not what i thought it would be
good,"Daily routing, set up deliveries according to availability of the day, delivered merchandise according to schedule, maintained warehouse and showroom. Being courteous to customers, encouraging them also to refer for new customer with an incentive through monetary or discounted rentals."
good,A very good company with room for growth.  the best part of job was being able to move up and grow with the company.  The people I worked with were great.  I really enjoyed overall experience.
good,It is a fast pace business and you must come to work lifting all day but you meet all sort of people some nice and some not so very nice but all in all ok to work for.
good,Great company to work for. Hours are good for a small family not paying for child care but if you have to pay for more than 1 child the hours can be bad for that.
good,every day is different. can be a fun place to work and can be hard place to work. The hours are rough sometimes. Getting to work out in the field is a plus.
good,it was a good job manager didnt want to do anything the peopl ei worked with was okay a typical day was ok some days nothing was planned and wasnt ready to b done.
good,It is a typical sales environment however the merchandise you're selling is sub par and over priced. the rent to own system is designed to take advantage of the poor and locking them into rent to own contracts to resale damaged goods.
good,"-My typical work day at Aaron's would consist of the following: greeting customers, marketing calls, managing deliveries, handling service issues, keeping up with the show room floor appearance, and selling furniture"
good,"I feel Aarons could better use their employees. When I get to work we are all making calls to collect money and waiting on customers. Then myself (Manager Trainee) and some of the PT's will go on the truck to collect items that have not been paid for, which I feel should be done in the afternoons when customers are normally at home."
good,I started in 2009 and this job has taken me to places I thought I would never see in the past 7 years. I would recommend Aaron's to anyone looking to have a career and not just a job!
good,"load truck "
good,"Responsible for working alongside managers and accepting delegated responsibilities and duties with the goal of eventually becoming a manager. Use company reports (which included income and balance sheets) to analyze sales, gross profit and inventory activity. Worked in different departments to gain perspective, including marketing, sales, customer services, purchasing, merchandising, finance, and personnel departments."
good,"This is a good place to work, and the company seams to value its employees better than most companies. The do have several bonuses available, decent starting pay."
good,I loved the flexibility of the job. It was challenging at times and kept me on my toes. The people I worked with were great and were always willing to help.
good,Its a good place to work. You get hour lunches and a very flexible work schedule. Management easy to get along with. I enjoyed my employeement at this location.
good,"Most like- I enjoy working with people. Trying to be the best customer service rep I could be.  Seeing the different needs and wants that people have is amazing."
good,"Friday morning meeting, achieve to reach sales goal for week, co-workers easy to get along with. Management had their bad days, hardest parts are learning to communicate with your customer; so your customer understands exactly what they are getting when purchasing any item(s) In the store, and also since customers can buy items over the phone, once a month you get a phone quiz. which tests you on how you sell over the phone, fun part of the job is when you have your sales or when you have customer appreciation day."
good,"Good with customers, make working with customers easy"
good,"You are always busy, if is not the phone ringing, you need to answer questions to the people walking in."
good,My day consisted of doing collection calls. I also did inventory on a weekly basis. I did sales and had to deal with customer issues. I took payments did what I had to do to keep the store running smoothly.
good,"Decent place to work, if you don't mind doing the job of two for half price. Management and staff were great, just demands too much for the pay. Your home time will be almost non-exsistant, so yes you get tons of overtime, and they dont mind paying it, but a delivery driver should be making half as much more than compensated."
good,Got to interact with new people evetyday. Was a delivery drive so spent alot of time on the road going from house to house delivering furniture. Always on the go kind of job.
good,I am what is called first up of the store as the assistant manager. I am am over five employees in helping our store to operate properly on a daily basis.
good,"The rental business is in general the same routine. A group of 6 to 10 of the same people in one building about 11 hours a day. I liked training people, which made my life easier. Having a good relationship with the associates is a must as long as the chain of respect is there. The hardest part of this job was repossessing a fridge or a television set when the customer has children that depends on these items day to day. The enjoyable part was the learning experience of running a business and being good at it."
good,the customers are great and I like having people buy stuff for there home and make it look beautiful for a low price and just working the people there are great as well.
good,Productive and fun workplace with flexible schedules friendly atmosphere and is good for anyone seeking advancement in the workplace. the work is hard yet rewarding and able to meet many interesting people of all diversities.
good,During my time with Aaron's I worked three different positions.  Each gave me an opportunity to learn the different functions of the company.  I was given the chance to prove myself and had the chance to advance not only in responsibility but in pay as well.  The downside is that it took all of my time.  I routinely worked 10 to 12 hour days five or six days a week.  The job would be great for a single dedicated person.  Anyone with family obligations should think twice before considering.
good,"Typical day working at Aaron's furniture included, delivering furniture to valued customers and often times repoing furniture as a last result."
good,Start off getting the deliveries together for the day seeing whos going first. Make our calls to see whos going to be home for the deliver
good,The accounts department can be a bit challenging.  Flexible work schedule.  Can be a little frustrating if you want overtime hours.  Great staff.
good,love working with my co workers hardest part is the standing and long hours. fun place to work. there was a lot of variety in what i did each tow
good,Leaving Aaron's was bittersweet. It is definitely not a career for me however it was a great starter job to get the skills I needed for driving and customer service.
good,It was a great place to work at but that store was going under. Within 2 years we went through 4 managers. Now I believe that store is closed.
good,"The management is questionable, but does provide a lot of opportunity for growth, and is a hard working environment to make store goals"
good,I would like to have more work/life balance and a more set advancement opportunities. Management has been very well except for one manager I have had.
good,This job is awesome for a single person that can dedicate their life to their job 24/7. show up at 8a.m. leave at 9p.m. inventory weekly.
good,"My typical work day consist of opening and closing of the store, and collections, sales."
good,15 years with the company and it was a joy to work there.  Compensation is fair and so is management.  Plenty of benefits.  401K match and good vacation time.
good," Greeted and assisted customers with their needs which conveyed and demonstrated quality customer service behaviors."
good,"I really enjoyed my job. When I was hired I was not told I had to have a cdl to work with delivery. But after 2 months of work they decide that both delivery guys have to have cdls. Since I take seizure medicine I cant get certified. So instead of putting me in a different position they let me go."
good,"I enjoyed the people and the work at the company, i also enjoyed working with the customers. But the were unorganized in some departments."
good,Aaron's is a great place to work if you are willing to put in the time and effort it takes to succeed. A typical day involves a lot of contact with customers on the phone and in person. You will encounter some difficult customers along the way but each day is different and fulfilling. Coworkers are very supportive and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the community.
good,I would work 5 days out the week 45 hours a week dealing with collections and handling the money and helping the gm on a day to day base
good,"I'd get to work and punch in and then proceed to see what the orders and deliveries are for the day.I would prepare the orders for deliveries that would consists of various household items such as furniture and appliances.After preparing I would notify my supervisor that I have done so and he would then review my work and determine if we are prepared for the road or not. From there we would go out and make deliveries to customers in their home, assemble the item if needed then on to the next one. After all deliveries we would return to the store, clean the truck up, then punch out."
good,This is a pretty good company. The is room for advancement within the comapany several locations. The management team was excellent.
good,"Era un buen lugar para trabajar, se lidiaba con diferentes situaciones como el cobro de facturas vencidas, entrega y recogido de mercancias en lugares dificiles (2dos pisos) y lidiar con clientes molestos por alguna situacion con el equipo.  Pero en general era un lugar adecuado para trabajar y donde se pasaba bien todo el dia."
good,Fun place to work. Co-workers are nice. Hardest part of this job was moving the furniture.
good,- Fun place to work but poor training program. Not much hands on training and you feel rushed and confused on the job.
good,The company is great if you have a great management team and like any other company if you don't well than it'll fall apart.
good,"Aaron's offered a great opportunity to work closely with my sales associates. We functioned very well as a team. There was never just one player better than the other. We were quite focused on achieving our sales goals, and were quite creative about developing new ways to increase sales. They were a pleasure to work with!"
good,Would be a great place to work if training was more formalized.
good,This company has the potential for fast advancement at the expense of long work days.  One could expect to work 8am-9pm without a doubt.  Those that enjoy customer interactions will have plenty of that opportunity.
good,12-13 Hour shifts on a daily were not fun. Overall not horrible though besides dealing with the grouchy customers who for some reason kept forgetting what their payment was and when it was due.
good,"I worked about 8 to 10 hours a day at Aarons Rental. My day consisted of delivering customer products, cleaning and repairing customer products, and debt collections. I learned how important it is to keep a positive attitude. I learned the a Delivery Driver/Customer Service Rep is the face of company and they play a pivotal role in exceeding the customers expectations. The hardest part of my job was the physical labor, but the most enjoyable part of my job was doing what I do best. Meeting the customers needs and making sure that every customer interaction was an enjoyable experience."
good,Enjoyed Traveling and enjoyed meeting new people every day. Enjoyed starting my day in a new store every day.
good,Rent to own industry is another step all together.  I am a manager trainee and
good,"An ideal company ,one the company and its employees helps each other in mutual development. Where I  utilize my skills and abilities and can gain more knowledge."
good,Not a great place to work since management doesn't want to hear when you have a problem with other staff...
good,"The company was small, but there were times that we ran multiple 3-8 man crews as work dictated.  Enjoyed selecting my own personnel for each project, and steady enough to maintain a core-group of personnel."
good,warehouse supervisor is and awesome guy to work with such as some of the managers.
good,long hours...good money. taxing job and difficult to be consistent.
good,I have been an Account Manager at Aarons for 2 years. I typically call customer who have failed to make a payment on their accounts in attempt to get their accounts up to date. I travel to customers houses that I have failed to contact us. I answer accounts calls and assist customers as needed.
good,Working for Aaron's was always something different everyday. You never saw the same problem day in and day out. I learned a lot about managing a sales team and what customers expect out of people. Most of the people I worked with were fantastic and the others not so much. Team work can be hard for people to understand if you don't have the right team behind you. All in all it was a very enjoyable job that I loved very much but the company itself needs some revamping and updated pay scales.The hardest part of my job was having to move stores and get use to a whole new crew after I have gotten the store I was in into the exact shape and routine I wanted it. The easiest part was helping the customers find exactly what they needed/ wanted and getting it to them.
good,Long hours and a lot of physical lifting of heavy merchandise was required. This is a job for a strong young person. Job advancement is slow but opportunities exist for an employee who excels at their work.
good,My typical day of work is simple and not entirely what I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. I have learned how to progress in my sales and received the experience of working in a office environment. The management is not horrible but there are a few things that could be changed and handled differently. I enjoy most of the staff and get along with the majority of all the employees. The hardest part of the job is when business is slow or when I cannot use or excel with the skills I have. I am a very active person so I do not like not being able to constantly do something and as I said before It is far from the field that I want to progress in. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers and ensuring they are getting outstanding customers service as well as getting exactly what they need.
good,"Very physically demanding job, alot of hours, very low pay."
good,"unloaded and deliver product to customers. Learned great customer services , great management team , and i had great co-workers. I enjoyed this job because it was a friendly environment."
good,It served its purpose in my life. but the season has come to an end.
good,was a fun place to work but got baught out by a franchise and everything went down hill from there
good,A typical day involved multiple calls to past due accounts and customer interaction on the sales floor.
good,active job a lot of inter action with costumers sales commission nice people to work with.
good,"As a (CSR) Customer Service Representative Aarons was a average experience with limited growth opportunity. I enjoyed  the job for a time but, after a while the tasks became redundant and stale. "
good,High energy and very fast paced work atmosphere.  Solid structure with ample opportunity for advancement.
good,Typical day consist of customer growth and collections. What I learned more so than anything is overcoming objections. Store level management is good but upper level seems to be in a disarray sometimes. Co-workers are a huge part of my success. The most difficult part of my job is sometimes the long hours which is an unbalance of work/life. The most satisfying part of my job is getting customers to ownership on their lease purchase.
good,"Seeing the same group of people (6 to 7) can really make your day or damper it. When there is a cancerous employee, it tends to spread rapidly. Money is decent, but agian, it depends on how successful your store is."
good,"I'm a CSR and I do a little bit of everything! I take accounts calls when the accts dept. isn't there, I set up service calls, I give the best service I can provide and I'm always looking out for my store... I've been with the company for almost 3 years and not to toot my horn but ok beep beep, I'm a great seller.... Always count on me to close the deal so tell me why my GM and my RG didn't give me a promotion for Sales Manager when I clearly have the skills? Oh yes cuz I don't have a degree!!! I personally don't think you can go to school to learn how to sell you're either born with it or you're not! Either way I tried to transfer to a different store bc the one I'm at didn't have an opening for SM and the GM at the other store offered it so I went for it but my GM wasn't happy with that so they decided to keep me where I'm at.They promote from within the company is what they say but it's all LIES!!!! They'll be quick to hire someone who has no clue about the business and pass up the people who work hard every day!! My GM is lazy and if he had a girl SM he'd have to help out with moving furniture etc... so that's why I didn't even get offered the position here and they hired a person who doesn't know how to do the job and is constantly asking me for what to do. Nedless to say I'm the only spanish speaking person at my store how ridiculous is that??? I'm sorry but setting up service calls isn't my job.... but of course I get stuck in the middle of translating, oh and lets not forget when the accts ppl need to collect money from a spanish speaking customer here they call me to"
good,"Im a Customer Service Rep at Aarons and with my position I do a bit of every position within the store. The GM relies heavy on a CSR so in other words Im a personal assistant. The job is extremely stressful not because of the customers but because of the unnecessary pressures of management within the company. Calling every hour to find out how many sales have been made, how many priors and overs have been collected on etc. It would all be worth it if they paid you for everything that you do within the store. Honestly the only upside to working for this company is that they are the only rent to own company that doesnt rip people off so it feels good working for a company with moral obligation to customers. The customers are generally happy with product and price but Ive been doing this for 3 years and it hasnt gotten any better. Need better management and better pay."
good,"At Aaron's it starts with opening procedures, getting the drawer from the vault to take to the register in the front, then the bank deposit would be made before opening having all electricall appliances turned on: TV's , Stereos' , laptops,and computers.  Plus the floor would have to be vaccumed and everything in the store from the entrance to the very back of our store would have to be clean that ment windex to glass and wood polish to furniture, all this had to be done before opening that was the hardes part of the job. My manager was fair and easy to work with, and the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction I got on a customer's face when I helped them get approved and sold them there merchandise."
good,Overall employees are nice but work is very hard. Got to be on your toes all the time. Compensation is not worth all the hard work.
good,Stayed busy helping customers.. Learned how to handle many situations on a professional level. The hardest part of the job was long hours.
good,Very rewarding helping customers find merchandise they need at a price they can afford. Never enough time in the day to get every thing done that needs to be done. Well compensated but exhausted at the end of every day.
good,Responsible for transport and instillation of merchandise to new and existing customers. Also required to operate and load 25' foot delivery truck. Further responsibilities included merchandise restoration and display. Employment included collecting dues from un-renewed clients and sales with emphasis on customer service.
good,Just be prepared to never see your family much. It's a good ole' boy system and females do not have much chance.
good,Ok place to work...wish it was more professional at the branch i was personally at. the pay was nothing worth braging about...with bills and living expenses its hard to grow financially. great job for some one just looking for something to do.
good,Good company to work for. Best part is recruiting and developing new staff and interacting and servicing within the community.
good,Aarons is a great indoor atmosphere centered around the customer and offers a good incentive package for the employees.  They have a rock solid program and a great training program with online college style classes you get paid to take.  The best part of the job there is being able to offer customers excellent customer service and beat competitors prices by large margins.  Unfortunately the management does not often follow the company guidelines and there seems to be no upper management correction to the situation.  The management pay is great but the gap from management to store associates is embarrassing.  The hardest part of the job is fighting with employees about running company programs that are not being run properly with no support from management.
good,everyday was a busy day lots to do and with plenty of people to help with the work load the management like to wade in where they can the people are good to work with
good,"Typical day would be delivering sofas tvs leaning new things all the time just call your supervisor after and before each stop , there wasnt a hard thing to do there"
good,Enjoyed working there for the time that I did its fast paced a lot of customer service and you get to know the customers well as you get to see of them a lot.
good,"Making call is the start of my day then we pick people from a list of people that haven't made they account current and we got to there house either to collect money or work with the some type of way or we pick up the product till they get on there feet then once the list is done or a nice amount was visited then we will go back to the store and make calls then we go home."
good,I worked for Aarons for a short time. It was exciting. The rush to sell sell sell was just great because you wanted to make the commission!!
good,The hardest part of the job was going to a person's home to take back products that the customer needs but can no longer pay for.
good,Always on the go I learned how to talk to people better.I loved field visits The Store was up and running great by management. co-workers were respectable. The hardest part of work was lack of work and the pay was my enjoyment! 
good,The hardest part of the job is trying not to take things personally. The most enjoyable part of the the job is the interaction with the different departments and the perks.
good,working for aarons I have learned many things just from day to day. I have learned how to manage time and others and it has also help me to become more self motivated.
good,What Can Isay about this establishment. It was difficult working there. The company at the time was in the middle of being sold and was slightly unorganized in the transition. I started as a customer service representative and quickly moved up to a customer service accounts manager in a matter of 3 months. I brought in a completely new team to help the store and it seemed to work out quite well. My co-workers were great. We worked hard as a team to help get the store back on its feet. The hardest part was learning the new rules of the store and policies when new owners took over. The best part was being apart of a great team. Through it all we stuck through the madness and helped pull the store together.
good,Typical day 50% inside & 50% outside collections - co workers were fine
good,Not everything that I thought it was. Underpaid and overworked.
good,Shifts are 10-7:30
good,"A typical day at Aarons would start off with many phone calls to customers that are past due on their accounts. Phone calls are made to get the customers to make a payment over the phone, or get a strong promise from the customer on what day they are able to make a payment. Throughout the day we take in store payments, and make sales to new customers. I also may make deliveries out in the field. Each day I'm still learning more about the company and trying to become comfortable with the job. My co-workers are like a family, we make the day a lot smoother for each other. We deal with different personalities within the customers, so we have to keep each other spirit lifted. There is nothing that I have faced yet that has been hard about the job. As I stated, we all (co-workers) keep each other going and don't mind lending a helping hand to each other."
good,P/T have no room for growth. Bad scheduling with customers orders and P/T work schedules.
good,Day to day work is fast pace and pressure to achive goals. Co-workers are great to work with. Store level manager good to work with and for.
good,I managed more than 900 retail properties from for all Facility Operations and Maintenance.
good,"Manage accounts, take payments, some deliveries and returns"
good,A Typical day at work taken and handling the employees and vendor phone calls making sure everyone is HAPPY
good,"I did collections for the most part. I made over 400 phone calls a day. It was long hours and physically demanding. I would have to visit homes, drive a small box truck, office work. loved my co workers but needed more help in my department."
good,"Liked working there, it was a fun enviroment. It is a very physical job."
good,not hard work but frustrating management. Two many cheifs and not enough indians.
good,Busy sometimes chaotic. I've not been threw all the training courses but started really at a bad time with other co workers being out for vacation and maternity. Just kind of thrown in there and doing multiple positions. Co workers are nice to work with just not enough team work. The hardest part of it for me is the long hours and not getting to be at home with my son. Very hard for a single mother. The most enjoyable part of my job I think is sales and am learning more and more everyday.
good,aarons is an ok company. if u have kids and a family than its not the place to apply to. u work 13 hr days 8 am to 9 pm 5 days a week.
good,I liked working here because i was a delivery driver so i was always away from the store and got to learn the city. Also worked with electronics and that was a big olus for me
good,After receiving a new warehouse manager he was firing all the slackers and would put up anything. I was trying to earn a full time position from workin in a temp service
good,"Meeting daily sales goals, catering to customers needs, data entry, verifying customers information, taking high volume of phone calls, marketing. I learned to enhance my professional communication and interpersonal skills. The hardest part of the job was the management time frequently changing but I quickly became acquaintances with new staff with my out-going personality. Enjoyed the sales team with how we worked as a team to meet daily sales goals."
good,We did not have a typical day at this place of business. Everyday was always different.
good,"I liked working there the manager was awesome,even tho sometimes the employees werent.But I wouldnt like to work there again."
good,As a sales manager I got the chance to work with the public and that I enjoyed alot helping others with things they needed.
good,"The hours are long but you work based on how well your store performs. It's easy to succeed with the company, when you have support from your higher ups!"
good,"It was okay working there but I really didn’t like it too much. Compensation was good and my former coworkers were friendly. However, the work load was insane"
good,"Safety hazards, kind of cut throat, long hours, they do make you take a 1 hr lunch so you dont get paid that hour even if you work straight thru. Two meetings a day, computer systems that dont populate to one another so there is lots of repetition,  and did I mention you're going to be in contact with bed bugs, roaches and have to visit non payers at night till 9 alone."
good,Pressure of people who don't want to pay and pressure in management enforcing people to pay can be stressful. Sitting too long can be annoying. They encourage you to learn a little bit of everything which is great.
good,I enjoyed my time at Aaron's.  The culture of the Company was always something you could count on.  I learned a lot as a Leader and was able to cultivate others while working there.
good,hard work is a must. You have to be dedicated to your job and your customers. If youre willing to go the extra mile they will love you for it. Nothing else to say.
good,In the beginning I was excited to start working there.After 2 months working there learning new roles compensation was low and didn't meet my requirements. I still enjoyed my time at Arron's for they were able to work time off when needed.
good,the job was fairly quiet and the workers were nice and well accomplished . the day always went well and it was always smooth and on going at a steady pace.
good,"Pays well compared to other entry level jobs, however, management compensation is lacking.  Long days, typically 8-9 for management and 9-7 for other associates."
good,I've worked for the company for close to 6 years and have worked under several managers. it is a great place to work with proper management. With improper management it is a nightmare.
good,Must be able to thrive in a high sales goal orientated environment. Management was always willing to take time to assist providing feedback and new strategies for maximum potential.
good,"My experience was tainted by a disgruntled employee who made working for the company pretty toxic for everyone who worked with her. Other than that, it was an ok place to work."
good,It was a good company but it was slowly changing is policy and the type of business that it used to be and lived by. It did offer medical insurance and vacation time off.
good,"it can be diferent from store to store where i im is not so busy and the manager is really nice,you have 30 min brake, some days are busyer than others. but over all is not a bad jog for the area"
good,good place to work for as you start to get into the sales industry. Potential to make good decent amount of money off of sales. delivery drivers use to get paid per hour plus per delivery. use to get bonus when new customers came in and mentioned your name.
good,"Not good if you are looking g for job security , turn over rate is very high due to the long hours. Also ot is a competitive sales job, no matter what your position."
good,"Overall the people I worked with were great, but hours varied a lot. Management always pushed to make the sale. And working with the customers could be difficult at times."
good,It can be a rough job. You show up you work till the day is done. Some days you get off early some days your there late. It is just a job and your expected to work
good,Great people to work with in Sudbury.  Was a great experience got into self marketing as well as marketing the store. As all sales positions go there are always challenges but were fun to overcome.  Commission structure was a little weak but not terrible.
good,it was good just busy and lot of work never get bored. you are all ways on the go and sometime you get off late but nice and fun and you meet a lot of new people
good,There is a lot too learn at this company if you take the time to pay attention. I must admit that I wasn't ready for the opportunity when it was given to me and thus failed to meet company standards.
good,"Good learning  experience, lots of  courses where you can learn to become a better employe and be come and expert in company policies, constantly challenging"
good,secure job.  long hours... just not for someone with a family or in a relationship as you will not have the time to spend with them.  You could work as late as 9pm and come in as early as 7:30am.
good,"Aaron's is a company that has a great culture; however, my experience with the company was challenging. The job itself was a great opportunity, but the the conditions were not favorable. The biggest reason was staff turnover and the location of the business itself. Because of these two obvious barriers, the overall potential for the company to grow was often hindered."
good,"A typical day at  work are long hours.  However, very rewarding when performance matches effort.  Hardest thing about work is finding associates that want to win as much as you."
good,"The time I was working at Aaron's, worked during the morning to dealt with customer services. It was a quiet place; the employees were all right to work with to get the job done."
good,honestly the pay was decent however the management was not all that great. there was almost no communication what so ever between our general manager and our sales manager which led to times when most of my day was spent doing busy work then in the last hour or two having 10+ deliveries and then me and the other product technician getting chewed out for being out after hours
good,"Better option for rent to own purchases, especially given more favorable approach to collections.  High turnover of managers and staff should be noted."
good,"I loved working at arrons however there were key factors that shot it down, pay for being a delivery driver were to low. Mainly loved the boss/company."
good,"Rent to own company. Very exploitative of customers. Corporate culture includes a lot of ""rah,rah"" meetings where enthusiasm is more important than competence at your job. Rote memorization of trivial platitudes is required of new hires. There is an extremely detailed and lengthy mission statement as well as a promise and other lists that are stressed in weekly meetings."
good,Made a lot of good friends. learned a lot in regards to the nature of people. Was fast paced witch I liked. Did not care for the hours in the credit department.
good,This is a good company with benefits and compensation but it is stressful and you are constantly pulled in many directions. The employees are the hardest part to deal with and collections.
good,"I viewed this as an exciting opportunity at the outset, but after the first year, major management changes have since caused the decline of overall production, and morale."
good,"Aarons is a fun and easy place to work if you are willing to put 100%. Hard to work schedule with kid's and family. 10 years I have been with Aarons and I have become part of the family. But as my kids are getting older I do need more time to be home with then, not recommended for anyone with kids and a family very long work hours. Sales can be lax at some pointed in the year depending on holidays or schools being out for the summer.. Collections also suffer when summer comes. Give 100% and you will succeed."
good,"I loved working with my customers and but this place at the time was not a very great place to work, other employees stealing you sale and stealing your commissions, damaging with other employees property."
good,"To many problems with the store I work for to list. The staff is friendly and fun, when they aren't busy, and the customers are easy to work with. Stress is far to high, the training they give doesn't explain much, and opportunities for any kind of raise are few and far between."
good,I didn't like the way they had you stay after your scheduled time with no warning. If the sales were not met for the day everyone had to stay even if you may have had 10 sales and no one else had any.
good,"It is a good job.  It is demanding and the hours are frequently long.  Some audits can be tedious.  But it can be fun, too.  If you like to travel - getting on a plane early on Monday morning - living out of a suitcase most weeks then you will enjoy this.  It is not for the faint of heart.  Auditors have a base store in their area of residence from which they operate.  In over 7 years I only went to Atlanta once."
good,It is rent to own. However you can do everything right and ultimately still be looked down on based on customers making their payments on time. You are just a number not a person.
good,"A decent job and still is; I am looking for advancement and more of a career now. There's favoritism shown to certain employees at times. Overall, I like working there but I feel it's time for a change. I learned how to install appliances, electronics, assemble furniture, and make sales. A day at work consisted of making deliveries, handling services calls, taking payments from customers.  There's no job too hard for me to handle once given the opportunity."
good,i loved the people that i worked with but the regional was not a understanding person. He didnt mind me doing the other position but wouldnt give it to me. Very unfair.
good,"A typical work day at Aarons consists of making daily calls to collect on past due accounts & to also advertise any upcoming promotions that the company is/will be offering."
good,A good place to work for and had some good employees learnt a lot about the customers I delivered to. The manager was a great person and great to get along with if you had any questions he would try his best to help you. co workers where easy to to get along as well
good,"Typical day at work taking in payments from customers, sell furniture."
good,Depending on what type of person is the General manager. This could be the best job you have ever had or pure agony every passing hour.
good,The typical day at this job come in at 8:00 am and probably leave at 8:00 or 9:00 pm. I've learned how to really treat my furniture and how to move furniture and pack it right without anything breaking. Know how to talk to customer and tell them how to fix any of there appliances over the phone.The management here SUCKS because they don't know what they are doing. I have to tell them how to do there job. I've only been here for a couple of months and I really need to get out of these place.
good,"its a decent job,40 hrs a week,crazy hrs but guaranteed 40 hrs,get paid very 2 weeks,they could pay more,best part about the job is the day moves so fast"
good,"I am the General Manager of the store and have a great team that I trained to be self managed and proactive. The environment  with my team is great and we all work towards the same goal, which is to be successful."
good,"The company overall is OK, but they really don't care about your well being or your health. Has long as you be their slave they will praise you but when it comes to helping you they have a closed mouth"
good,I worked in the fleet department which was a smaller department. As an administrative assistant in this company there was no room for me to grow or advance. My store consisted of me and my manager. I had an amazing manager. I was taught all about customer care and the fleet services. I also learned how a company works together and communicates through different departments. The company was going through some changes so it was very stressful and disorganized. There was a lot of internal issues at the corporate level. Many people felt that they were given too heavy a work load and quit. Within my department we lost around at least 5 employees in a four month time period.  The hardest part of the job was making sure everyone got the necessary paperwork and filled it out correctly. The best part of the job was talking to customers and working with my boss.
good,Worked for the company for going on 4 years. I love the people I work with and I embrace the culture and standards. Working 50-60 hours weekly is expected. Compensation is great along with the benefits. If you are single and don't mind working long hours this is job for you.
good,"Really Chill work environment , it was not corporate but that was the biggest pro and con. I was the youngest sales person and did not receive  the same perks as the managers. they would leave for hours and get ""early days""; meaning managers would swap the days each one closed. i was also fired for a crime i was never convicted of. which was total bs bc one of the managers was a recovering alcoholic and had many criminal offenses. Overall it was the best and worse job iv have ever had. I was treated unfairly and made to clean the bathrooms everyday even though i watched the interview tape and it said the bathroom chore was to be rotated amongst positions."
good,Interesting place to work for if you like to be mistreated. They give unattainable goals so that they don't have to pay. They pay is not that great to go out and repo someone's television that they paid for 3 times over.
good,What I learned working for Aaron is how to manage the customer and to also have great communication and how to satisfy the customers needs and wants when it come to the product they are looking for when they walk in the store.
good,"I have not worked with Aaron's for long, But I have worked in the work force since the age of 14.  Taking management courses and training classes.  I do not believe that all stores operate in the same manner as the store I work in.  It pays the bills so I will stay til I find another job."
good,"As a CSR, typical duties are selling furniture and explaining the leasing process/price options, upkeep and cleaning the showroom, processing payments, weekly inventory, taking and placing phone calls, and balancing the till at the end of the night."
good,"Routine work, old-school company trying to remake itself in a volatile industry. New management is applying bandages to problems within the organization that are not targeting the real problems."
good,"Its a very fast paste job .... Their is team work, but sometimes they lack in communication. I enjoy the challenges and contest that they provide for you to win extra cash or gift cards. The hardest part of the job is getting to know all the SKU  of each item."
good,Working at Aarons was very interesting. Everyday we went in knowing it was going to be a very busy day. Management was very poor as the did anything to make a sale not worried on the well being of there employees. The only good thing is the high work rate of the employees to help each other get threw the day together. The hardest part of the job was all the heavy lifting that we would do threw out the day.
good,"Aaron's only cares about the numbers. Whether you are on the phones all day calling your nons or you are on the phone making sales calls, if you do not hit your numbers, you get written up. I worked under 3 different GMs and 2 different RMs. I have always enjoyed my job because the people I worked with were really fun to be around. Once the 2nd GM left, it's been a nightmare. Everything is very unorganized and chaotic. I am the SM but I am doing GM duties and CAM duties. I didn't mind doing it with the 2 older GMs but I don't like the way I am being treated now."
good,"Great benefits , long hours, need to value employees more, overall pretty good company to work for."
good,I enjoy the job but unfortunately there isnt very much room for advancement
good,Division Bought out. Demanding job can Be slow some week and wor several hours of overtime The next.
good,the management is ok and I love my co-workers the hardest part about the job is the lack of pay
good,Working closely with 7 to 8 other people you start to form a bond and that's how Aaron's wants associates to feel.  It's comfortable and friendly while maintaining professional appearance.
good,As a manager I was responsible for the highest level of planning for my store. It is all about hitting your numbers. You need to hit your numbers or you will definitely be scrutinized by upper management.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Aaron's. It is a great place to meet and interact with new people, and you feel a sense of pride knowing that you have met your customer's needs with the service that Aaron's provides!"
good,"Product has to be staged in the warehouse, If product is sold from the showroom floor. Then replenish what you pulled off the showroom floor. shrink wrap product and load onto truck and delivery it in a timely manner."
good,a typical day at work a lot  of work  but I am a very hard worker  like to get things don in a time lee manor
good,"Aaron's is an excellent company for advancement opportunities however, to be considered for a promotion you must be willing to put in roughly 80 hours a week. The base pay for General Managers is about par for the industry but the bonus potential is above most other companies I have seen."
good,The people I work with work with were great. The position was constant with work daily and a lot of communication with contractor and  site management.
good,"It is a good company to work for.  This is a fun place to work "
good,"Working with Aarons Sales and Lease was very stressful to say the least. There were many inconsistencies with communication, both between employees and management and between customers and associates. Scheduled deliveries were usually written wrong in the delivery book, delivery paperwork was always difficult to find each morning, and much more that made the job much more difficult than it needed to be."
good,"Calling people everyday to get them to pay there bill, if you can't get ahold of them then you have to go to there house. Then listen to them tell you how you are a insensitve person because they didn't pay there bill and you are asking them for money when their mother, father, grandma, grandpa, brother, sister, cousin that was three times removed or dog just died. How dare you"
good,"management is always changing here at this company, everyone stabs each other in the back. Management does not communicate well with employees"
good,"A typical day at work could be slow at times when I am used to fast paced, and I was there six days a week mostly, ten hours per day. I learned a great deal about the business, sales and things about myself that were my best charactersitics and things I needed to improve. The co workers were always kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the many different guidelines and ""acceptions"" that occured, simply something that would have taken more time. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating something wonderful out of a blank space, and meeting the customers and creating relationships with them."
good,"Everyday started the same for me. Open up the store and start taking daily payments. I learned alot about computers and how to work closely with a certain group of people. My co-workers were great, and my boss was the best. The most difficult part of my job was telomarketing. I am not sure why because i am very comfortable talking to people i dont know. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public everyday."
good,While working with Aaaron's Inc. I have learned both the sales and service side of the business.
good,"My day at work is very busy. My store has a high volume of people in and out everyday. So you are always busy talking and helping or coaching customers to either resolve a service issue they have with there merchandise. I am responsible for 500 customers to make sure that there accounts become current and if they have any issues with there account i am the one who is in charge of making it correct. I also have to make sure my employes are doing the right things and learning how to be successful everyday. That is part of management and making sure you are training employees to learn and do the right things. My co workers and staff is a very enjoyable group to be around. We work 45 to 50 hours a week so we try and make it as enjoyable as possible for eachother. We are a big family at my store and when you have a great staff you can run a great buisness. The hardest part of my job is the hours and sometimes the customers.There is customers that talk to you any way that they want and you just have to let it bounce off you because if you dont it can stick to you the whole day and make your attitude not the best. The most enjoyable part is my staff, my boss and staff are a very fun group and all very respectable people with goals to achieve at our company. Everybody wants to be a winner and when you have that attitude you gonna win."
good,"Work consist of effective communication, i have learned to be positive in my approach and to always smile."
good,"overall desent job. Typical work day is from 10am to 7pm, one will learn about furniture repair. Work environment is very well balanced."
good,I was working for the new Homesmart. I see plenty opportunity for advancement but their is a lot of new management here that is still learning the system themselves. I feel like I might know more about
good,"As an employee, we were responsible for sales as well as customer service and checking inventory on a daily basis."
good,Great place to work for. Great training. Extremely demanding of time. 7 day work week. Best part is having the ability to help other grow and achieve their goals
good,"Multicultural environment, flexible hours, some heavy lifting, pleasant work atmosphere, in person and online training friendly management and workers"
good,"Great people to work with. Fun atmosphere. Small store that does not have a competitive salary compared to other aarons stores. Must be willing to deal with alot of customers paid on the first of the month. Must be out going. Friendly employees, lots of cleaning and lots of phone calls. Overall a great place to work if your a good honest person."
good,When I started it was corporate but felt local and family but it is becoming more and more corporate and numbers.... It can be easy or it can be hard.  Under payed for the hard workers
good,Fun and relaxed place to work the crew is like a family there. I really enjoyed working there it was always pleasant and I loved my co-workers I would recommend
good,"Great start to get your foot into the corporate world, but not a company for long term career. Company was gpod, but current changes only drive sales and field employees."
good,"Schedule constantly changing, I have been working for AARON'S for about 8 weeks now and I have just been told they are closing this location. I can still work for them, however, the other location is 30 miles from my house one way. For the money I don't think that it will be beneficial, I work only 17 1/2 hours a week and this is all on the weekends Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."
good,"I loved my job at Aaron’s ,we had a amazing staff and everyone got along job .I left when my father passed away I had to move out of state for a while and lost my job here."
good,I was the delivery driver 5 days a week.once a week on Wednesday a shipment truck came in and nobody wanted to help unload the truck.The people in the office always acted as if they were busy and made me and my parter do all the work.
good,"we get in grab are coffees  get are delery slips for the day and set up are route turn the store on, get  are deliveries ready and loaded and start the day. The work place was a great place to work everybody got along to get the job done."
good,the job itself was great its just the late work hours. I really enjoyed the years ive worked at Aarons. My coworkers were like family to me . we all grew on each other.
good,Really difficult work atmosphere. Company did not advertise to its audience. Old school flyers were passed out daily/ weekly to get customers to notice our business.
good,A good place to work and can learn a lot over the past six years while working with the company and customers. Very fast paced and you have to have patience.
good,The hardest part of the job is to repo someones oven or fridge if they are unable to make a payment. People are paying double and triple for items such as a tv.
good,The only manager i liked there was my sales manager. The store was suppose to be a team but it felt like everyone had there own little clique like school
good,"Productive fast pace work environment, getting to know customers on first name basis and helping them to obtain merchandise for their home and need. Assisting general manager in day to day activity with managing store and employees, also ensuring customers receive their merchandise as soon inventory was available . all together very rewarding job with good people."
good,Long hours for little pay. There are some rewards but it was based on the sales team if everyone below management got them. Expected way too much from employees and was understaffed constantly. Always played favourites as well.
good,This job is ok! But not if want to have family time! On Saturdays everyone works. Sundays is closed. And one day off during the week! The hours generally can range from 8am to 8 pm depending on your title.
good,Easy job a job is what you male it. Only thing is they pay bi_weekly something most ppl don't like to do unless it's 800 or better for me personally but..hey
good,good place to work but hard at times good environment but not easy to work for. it a job so and they have good benefits and good pay rate easy at time.
good,Long hours. Good team environment. Could have had better pay. Made lifelong friends. Discounts on furniture. Would often get off long after scheduled.
good,Aaron's Sale and Lease is an amazing company and concept over all. The specific location I was hired at was very disorganized and management was poor. The work place was very hostile and contained many issues. The hardest part of my job was picking up the slack when others were not doing their job properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and meeting sale goals.
good,"Make phone calls house visits and sales when possible.Learned to use different programs on pc. Management was tough,expections were high and never to appreciative of what was achieved. My team was highly motived and was always a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of this job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of making a customer happy by solving an issue with their account (financially,or with merchandise)."
good,Every one was extremely nice and we had each others backs. The job itself was hard for me as one of my duties included bringing items to the show room floor. Which is I could no longer perform my duties when i became pregnant.
good,"Always something to do"
good,"this position requires you to deal with the delinquent customers, therefore creating a hostile environment-lots of threats and yelling"
good,"My opinion about the job is that I don't like it, Its not for me i don't like how they conduct work, or handle issues.  When I was hired my job title consisted of; delivering furniture and appliances, installing them and fixing any issue that may have occurred. In reality i make about 2 deliveries a week and call dozens of people a day bugging them about buying furniture from us. I do not like making phone calls all day I do not enjoying sitting inside all day and i just don't like working for the company any more!"
good,Aarons was pretty productive. I learned how to work a fork lift and ect. The management was pretty ok. My co-workers were not as dependable. The hardest part about the job was adjusting to the shift changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills.
good,"Working for Aaron's is an experience, reason is, you learn all aspect's of the job. From customer service, technical issues with merchandise, inventory, management skills, planning and goal structure. Yet job seems to always be on the line if the quotas aren't met. So the job security isn't really there but I've been there going on 3yrs haven't advanced much and spend lot more time there than being at home working 9-9 hours which isn't bad unless your getting $17hr for the stress. Yet a job is a job and this job is good to know you can put up with work and work hard."
good,"The nation's premier retailer of furniture, consumer electronics and home appliances provided via sales and lease ownership, SEI/Aaron's has grown to operate over 100 Aaron's stores in 10 states.  We've won Aaron's Franchisee of the Year award and been named to the Inc. 500 list as one of the fastest-growing companies in the USA, but we are most proud of the achievements of our 850 associates and our relationships with the 90,000 customers that choose to shop with us. I opened Store number 6"
good,Great place to work and grow as a person. Aaron's is big on helping people and giving back to the community. What I enjoy most about this job is helping people and making a difference in their lives.
good,The whole store is like one big family and everybody gets along. Very fun place to work. But you do have to get your hands dirty when they get returned merchandise because you are the one who cleans it.
good,Team work plays a big roll. You have to be very energetic/ outgoing person in order to make sales. Get familiar with the products in the company and that can be pretty hard seeing they got so many products.
good,This can be a stressful place to work depending on the crew you have to work with. As the G.M. you are responsible for everything that goes on in the store. I enjoyed taking care of my customer's by providing the highest level of customer service.
good,"a typical day at work is often slow, I have learned to be more aggressive in seeking sales leads.My co workers are fun and knowledgable. The hardest part of this job is seeking sales leads on a daily basis."
good,Load and unloading merchandise. I learned how to install/uninstall merchandises. Co-workers work great but management lacked working as a team. Hardest part of the job is moving merchandise to a upper floor.
good,Aarons is a great starter job and has fast advancement.  It is a resume booster as well.
good,general manager is awesome person to work for. a lot of lifting. meet a lot of people.
good,"Everyday would be exactly the same. I'd deliver furniture, I'd collect money and write up receipts for our books. I'd clean the furniture if it needed returned and I'd straighten out the warehouse."
good,"Varried work schedule makes it hard for single parents because of a mid day to evening schedule. If you are a PT (product technician) its next to impossible to be promoted within unless you are a huge superstar. Every day we receive phone calls regarding new customers we don't get or non paying customers, and even though you may do your job and meet company standards they still demand you work harder and push you to go further to help compensate for other stores who don't perform well. so in other words, they don't punish the bottom stores directly. they make the top ones do that much more...and don't worry about how good you were the day before, because today you are a failure until otherwise told. OH YEA, and if you are short staffed for pt's and you are in charge of a department, you are yelled at because you have to do deliveries and run your department as if you are fully staffed...there is no such thing as a good effort. It's all or nothing, And last but not least the pay is ok if you are bonusing out every month. you get paid weekly so it helps with less taxes. however for the mental and physical strain, it feels its not worth it. pay average is $9-$11/hr  depending the position. they promise great things but often they set the goal a bit too high for some positions."
good,"A typical day, I come in and work on the nons-side of the accounting department. After that, I help open the store and get the registers ready for the day. I keep in contact with customer's with their products and to see if there is any other merchandise or product I can get them. If so, I spend time going in depth with the pricing on the product. I love my co-workers, but days can be challenging as we are a hard working store., and some days it feels like its not good enough."
good,"Everyday can be different filled with deliveries, cleaning returned product like furniture and appliances as well as electronics. Some times the general manager would have one of the PT's go out with an accounts person on runs or field visits. being there with the same people day after day it can get frustrating but can make good friendships. the hard part of the job is the heavy lifting moving in furniture into customers homes carefully with little to no damage to the furniture and the place being delivered to."
good,"good hrs just a little hard work,carrying heavy merchandise up and down alot of steps in tight spots around corners"
good,At the end of the day it is pointless how well you do your job. It will still be threatened. If you are good and your department is struggling they will not evaluate you as an individual.
good,Aarons has good benefits but low grade pay with raises every six months but theres not much family life
good,i loved working there until we got the most recent gm cause he treated me and the other product tech like we was trash
good,A typical day at Aaron's is busy busy busy. I learned a lot about sales and collections while working there. The management is not exactly friendly. Co-workers were awesome it was like going to work with my friends every day. The hardest part of the job would be being out in the heat all day. The most enjoyable thing would be driving the trucks.
good,Deliver the product that is on the schedule for the day. Build all product for the sales floor and for the delivery. Deliver product and set the product up for the customer. Answer any questions on how to opperate the electronics or devices. I would typically work with another driver but sometimes I would have to do some deliveries by myself. Working by yourself was the best and the worst part of the job. If it was to heavy that was a problem but sometimes working by myself was perfect.
good,I learned how to really sell here. really get to know customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time within this company. They had competitive salary and plenty of room for advancement. Treated thier staff well and as a company whole, a very put together company."
good,"Great work environment"
good,"It  was  a enjoyable place to work for several years then the founder of the company retired,then things changed for the worse, I was not the only one that feel this way,  I was exceptionlly good at my job and other GM and regionals looked at me for guidence. I am very hard working.Thank you for your concideration."
good,"This company, for the most part, is great to work for. They generally tend to take care of their associates. But who you work under can make all the difference. I personally went through an issue at my store location where I (untrained and unprepared) had to take over my store for about a month. I was not given help by my region or the regional manager and when they did bring in a new Store Manager and reassessed the store they pretty much blamed me for the things wrong in my department. Knowing that I had not been able to focus on that given the fact I was recently running the entire store by myself! And I was threatened to be demoted or released if I didnt get it ""under control"" in a short amount of time. In order to keep my job (because I am the sole income of my household) I demoted my self to keep the RM off my back and to just let me do my job. I had to deal with all that after I put my inexperienced team of a new sales rep and pt on my back and held the store down for a month not knowing everything about being a store manager. I only had 2 other associates with me in the store who again were brand new to the company. They both were still in their orientation weeks. I was over worked, burnt out and underappreciated.  The only reason why I've stuck it out this long is because the new GM is a great guy. He is a young motivated and dedicated father just trying to provide for his family and move up in the world. He was thrown into the role of GM at a sudden and has been trying to learn as he goes. He too is getting the same treatment I got when all that went down. I simply"
good,"For the first nine years I was satisfied with company guidelines and policies. However, in the past six months they have gone in the wrong directions for me.Will explain when I am being interviewed."
good,If you choose to go into any management postion be prepared to work 45 hours a week minimum. It is very cut throat to promote to a GM. Collections consist of field and phone.
good,"I enjoyed working at Aaron's the little time I did. But it interfered with my hone life activities with my kids, I thought I would be able to work something out but it didn't work that way. Needless to say the employees were awesome and the GM was one of the coolest people . I'm sure the way I left they don't care for me but I hope the best for them all."
good,"Overseeing daily goals for sales and collections, managing a team of 6 people, balancing the stores monthly p&L, being responsible for all inventory and cash flow and maintaining a certain profit percentage each month."
good,Loved the atmosphere and my coworkers.  The hardest part of the was arranging the showroom.  I moved a lot of the furniture around which was very heavy with minimal help.  the most enjoyable part of the working at Aarons was competing with my co workers on Sales.
good,"Franchise lease to own company with many locations in both Oregon and Washington.  Every store is run basically same way, with 2 drivers, customer service, sales manager, account collections, account manager, and general manager.  Rent to anyone one, with or without credit, just verifying few pieces of information.  Ownership at end of contract or can be purchased early."
good,Aarons overall is not a bad company nice people weekly pay some heavy lifting but its a furniture company so it's expected the bad thing is the weekly pay
good,Be mindful of the hours be available for any adversity  hydrate be on time be positive  have good energy  dress appropriately  men hair be trim  ladies hair in a ponytail
good,"Management was good, advanced quickly with hard work, environment was fun and relaxing, need good people skills to work with company though. discounts on product"
good,I loved my job it had its ups and downs like any other place i would go back if somethings changed. Most of the employees were great to work with and always willing to help you move up.
good,Been here for a long time lover the company an customers but don't like the direction the company is going. Awesome management good benefits just no longer a good fit for my current lifestyle.
good,Work hard and help one another. Every one can lend a hand in any position. Patience is key to dealing with some customers. But there are always goals set and ways to achieve bonuses
good,"Company is organized in theory pretty well, actual application of concepts leaves a lot to be desired. "
good,"Nice employee's friendly environment. Current store manager is unfriendly at times though. but as far as the company itself, it is wonderful and a great place to work."
good,the one thing i  love about landscaping is being on your own an in a team cause we all work together to get the same goal achieved but i can spend alot of the time on my own walking n getting awesome sun
good,"You will have to work with customer side by side for sales. in the renewals dept. you will have to make calls, field visit and collect on account. This is a fast pace company that not anyone is cut out to do the job."
good,"Great Co-worker, many hard working people who are trying to get by. It is a more physical labor job then most warehouse asking employees to be lifting heavy part daily as a team and request meeting daily production goals"
good,wonderful place to work. great people and enjoy working there. Only problem i have its long days and not much advancement. lots of vacation time and payed holidays.
good,I enjoy my job but with the hours i work it is extremely taxing. 8am to 9pm. I know the Customer base really well and i believe aarons is putting the customer first but as far at working in the accounts department i hate the hours
good,"The hours are great if you're looking for a full time job with actual full time hours. Always room for advancement."
good,"Aaron's is a good starter for customer service and great opportunity to grow in the company. There are downs to the company beginning in the rent to own business, but it one of the best companies. Management and employee's are very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. Aaron's help me learn great customer service skills, juggling multiple tasks, and finding solutions for customers. A very easy job with flexible hours."
good,Great to work one on one with clients. plenty of different things to do. Money was ok. Management pretty good. Too much strongarm on collections
good,"As a franchise, Aaron's policy was not followed. Management was non existent. Co workers fought on daily basis. Ways to move up if you could survive the lack of management."
good,I learned how manage others also learn leadership and setting and hitting goals
good,If you want to work in Aarons I recommend looking for franchise stores that need help. Corporate stores don’t take care of their employees. Only franchise will give you a better opportunity.
good,"When you arrive you are handed a stack of papers and told , this is where you are going and this is what you are delivering . I have learned that if you are outspoken it will cost you and they don't care about your ideas when it contradicts theirs . You will be cut short and ignored . It does not help when certain people in the office are two faced and like to throw you under the bus . The best thing is the people I work closely with . I consider them as close as family ."
good,I’m just writing this because it forces me 2. I like working at Aaron’s it’s a great opportunity with decent pay and ok hours. Would give it a 5/10 to work
good,This is a wonderful and great company to work for there is a lot of opportunity to grow and gain knowledge here. They have amazing Benefits and are like and big family
good,the best thing abt aarons was the customer based we got a chance to help people wIth bad crEDIT FURNACE THERE HOMES. aaromn was aloso very flexable with hours
good,worked for home solution center in kennesaw Georgia and really enjoyed it. Managers were awesome and understanding. Company was family oriented. Job is easy just do what is expected and go home
good,Hours are long with strict goals. The store is often understaffed and overworked. Upper management does not care whether all efforts are put forth. Pay is good.
good,"Keep your head on the swivel, and make sure you watch what you say. Other than that Your co-workers make the place fun and interesting. Sometimes the customers are off the chain but it's still cool."
good,"fun place to work, a lot is expected out of you with little pay. lots of heavy lifting and customer contact. houses arent always the nicest. decent health benefits"
good,Great place to work.  You get burnt out quickly as a product tech.  Lots of heavy lifting.  The atmosphere is great.  Most of the people that work there are people persons.  You meet a lot of cool people.
good,"Working for Aarons allowed me to learn about different products, and made me learn how to put together tables, tvs and washers and dryers. I would go back if I had too."
good,This was a great first job. The management has a hard time with scheduling! Th raises are based hourly and always room to get promoted. Promotions are favor based!
good,"Arrive at the store at 8:00 A.M. Set or update goal boards. Each morning have a strategy meeting with my staff. This is done to ensure everyone in the department knew what our goals were and where we were and what we had to accomplish each day to ensure goals were meet at the end of the cycle. Report this information to the General Manger to be reported to Regional Manager. Begin calling non renewed accounts by 8:30. The calls were made twice a day. After the first calls were finished I reviewed the numbers and assigned my assistants route sheets (field visits) to address any priority accounts. I would then address the accounts 30+ accounts preforming investigations using several different methods/programs to locate and address these high priority accounts to ensure these accounts would be successful and acquire ownership and prevent charge-offs. Mid day I would assist the General Manager in daily operations of the store. Assist customers in acquiring new leases, closing the contracts, scheduling deliveries and directing staff. I maintained a constant visual of the showroom making adjustments and setting up new merchandise if necessary. Loading and unloading of merchandise off the trucks. Organizing delivery schedules and directing staff to the schedule. A second call through in the afternoon and then the closing of the store. This required preparing deposits and all store accounting. The day ended with security checks and balances to ensure a safe operation. Close lock the store between 7:00-9:00 P.M."
good,"A typical work day at Aaron's was we had morning and evening routes for the day. Sometimes there were a lot of stops to make others times it wasn't a lot at all. We made delivery stops, returns, service calls and field visits. I gained some knowledge about different electronics and appliances that I didn't know so much about before. I also learned how to install appliances such as washers and dryers. The management team was kind of laid back. The hardest part of this job was lifting certain product that was real heavy and never knowing what time I was going to get off."
good,"Review deliveries and setup items to be dropped off"
good,"if like a job were you listen to music play with customers, see tv. this is an up beat job full of fun."
good,Good job if you like dealing with the public. Not so backbreaking however there are some days where its just crazy. Good advancement program.
good,"As far as working for this company goes it's great. The benefits are endless and so are the opportunities to advance and move up the ladder. However, the only downside is that you would have to be willing to put in 50 hours a week and work from 8 am to 9 pm most of the time."
good,"1) Able to talk to customers but also able to work outside of store."
good,Assist customers with American Express Cards
good,Good overall place to work.  The office I’m located at in St. Cloud is great. The GM is one of the best managers I have ever came across.  I would recommend this place if you’re looking to be a GM of retail.
good,Enjoyed working for the company really liked the culture of customer service they cultivate among the staff. Received commission as well as set hourly pay. However if the company guide lines are not implemented correctly it was a chaotic environment.
good,Just working hard everyday to make sure the merchandise is correctly displayed on the showroom floor and making sure the customer have a great experience when they walk into the store.
good,I have been working in the rent to own for over ten years. I really like what I do because I have a good relationship with 80 percent of the customer base and not only do I manage their accounts I'm also one of the top sales people in the store so I recieve bonuses from both departments.
good,Great Job but no home life but I've been there a long time and like the job just takes up all your day i worked in accounts and sales and  i love the way the company keeps accounts and sales separate
good,"I liked working at Aarons, generally answering phones cleaning and service issues. Staging and pricing merchandise. The manager was amazing and easy to work for. The hardest part of the day was handling service issues and account issues"
good,"Still learning the odds and ends of the entire company. Co workers seem to try and achieve goals/ more focus can be given. way more efforts can be made at trying to achieve the company standards. Management is great very hard worker tries to push for the standards. more positive attitudes to increase goal. Can stand different guidelines as far as collection goes. need to change up the way they are use to dealing with customers. hardest part of the job is being that I sometimes have to collect heavy items. enjoyable part is knowing the fact that trying to reach the company standards while at the same time keeping our customers coming, staying committed, and grow as one."
good,when not busy days are long and board but I like going out doing delivery  than sitting in store making calls or waiting for customers to walk in
good,"It a good place to work at. You get to learn different areas in Buffalo. And a good learning experience. And also you learn alot about setting up the showroom for the customers, you learn how to fix thing and setup different products."
good,very good hard worker. skills speaks for themselves. fast track quick learner. multitaskable trainer. gets along well with others
good,Aaron's schedule leaves no room for flexibility for family time or school involement. They continue to emphasize that this is a business & this is how it works if you want a career with Aaron's.
good,"Long Hour, No work life balance, The culture is everything with this company. If you have the right general manager then you will be fine."
good,It is a very nice place to work for. I love the management. And my Co-Workers. I want better hours.
good,go in and start calling about payments that are due and once done go into the field to get the payments for those with no contact. Also do deliverys and pick ups for those who cant pay. I have been learning how to deal with all situations in life for our customers and try to help them the best i can. my co-workers are great and we are all on the same page. Hardest thing about the job is trying to determine if people are being truthful or not about situation and the most enjoyable is meeting all sales goals and being off of sunday to spend day with family.
good,This job gave me all the experience I needed to become a sales representative. I learned different ways to approach customers and to achieve my sales.
good,"To be honest, I was very pleased on having an awesome team. We definitely worked well together. The only down side to this job is if anyone would called off, you would have to stay due to being down an employee."
good,"this place taught me so much, I enjoyed my time there. the manager aat the time Pam the sweetest lady ever. she made us want to work hard for her & my co-workers pushed me to the best I could."
good,It is an excellent place to work with an excellent benefit package.
good,"satisfaction with the employer,always greeted by my clients always got called back the clients always expected for me to go the harded part was traffic for me to go"
good,i like the job its easy and very enjoyable being able to interact with the customers and learn every day. Many things new about retail and how to properly assist with the customers needs
good,"It's an ok to work for good money, only thing they lack is when by your self in a truck they will make you work 2 man jobs by yourself without sending you any help ive done it almost 2 to 3 months."
good,Over all it was a fun job. I was getting trained to be the cam. There was some political problems that happened when I got there. the boss had not realized the sales manager at the time had opened my paystub to know how much I was making and everyone quit. other than that the job was fun the boss was great and the work atmosphere is built to be fun for both the employees and the customers.
good,Really love my current manager. however I do not like the corporate  decisions with recent changes in display of pricing. It makes it difficult to sell the merchandise to the guest because of the discieving price card.
good,"Management was always great. I had great leaders and mentors that helped me throughout my career. The hardest part about the job is the crazy work hours that I was away from my family. Everyday was a new and different day. If you enjoy learning, you can learn a lot but only if you choose to. You also have the ability to be as successful as you want to be."
good,"The kind of job I really want I cannot find. I want to work in a file room/office somewhere with minimal contact with the public. I like filing  and sorting kind of work. Can't seem to find anything or it all goes to females."
good,Aaron's was great for my first full time job. It's base pay then commission every 4th Friday. They pay weekly and hourly is dependent on your hiring manager. I was laid off due to a store closing but they offered me a nice severance package. As a customer service rep you work 5 days a week open to close. It can get frustrating if you don't have a good team in place.
good,"Although I like working for Aaron's I do not like the long hours, no benefits, and no retirement program. The store had been under staffed for some time. I am looking for a career. Somewhere I can retore from and advance within."
good,"It all depends on the manager or GM at the store. My general manager was ok. Overall the atmosphere was ok for the most part. You get to meet new people, lead customers to ownership."
good,"Store manager, Managed a sales team, customer service representatives, product technicians. Maintained and aquire customers, marketing, scheduling, completing marketing and sales goals."
good,"I have worked for Aaron's for a total of almost 7 years. After receiving a promotion with Aaron's, I have seen every employee brought in to take my former position make more hourly than I was currently making. Aaron's is a great place for advancement, as long as every aspect of your life, professionally and personally, revolves around Aaron's."
good,If you are in the right group you will do great.  Once was a great place to work they use to care until top leadership changed . Now only worry about their stock options and bonus . Leadership needs to go see what they have fostered
good,"I loved working there the job is challenging and you learn alot about ppl. but the days i woked was stressful , the days off was never together . AND it was always a demand from management for more no matter how good your numbers was . very stressful job ."
good,The hours were pretty brutal for pay that wasn’t so much worth it. The other employees made it worth it. It could be a demanding job depending on the day but overall it wasn’t too bad
good,"as a manager in training as they called the collection agents at the time i was employed, you call customers every second of the day unless IF allowed to get up and use RR. Occasionally if the top manager of collections liked you, you would go out and try to collect payments from customer houses.. would of liked to be able to learn customer service up front or delivery and set up but not if you get hired on as manager in training"
good,Nice company to work for with the right management. The discounts are worth working there alone.  I love the fact that they report to the credit bureaus.
good,They gave good incentives for you to be with family if an emergency accord but the management was poor need to have managers that care and respect there employees.
good,"manager was fun, always something to do. kept me busy and on my feet. customers were mostly sweet and were willing to work with us. team meeting were very informative."
good,"The days were long for only 9.50 ahour we would work 9 to 8 "
good,"Managed a sales team consisting of two customer service representatives and three product technicians, while maintaining and acquiring customers"
good,I like my job but management goes on major power trips at times.  They don't talk to me like I am a grown man.
good,"keeping everything clean and organized, filing and cash handling made me a better team player"
good,This job is made for someone who can take a lot of bs and still get paid hardly anything. The management is lousy and doesnt know anything about the employees or the job at hand. The upper part of this company look out for themselves and don't give two cents about the lower employees. Recommendation---dont work here.
good,"the job is rewarding, though corporate could pa more"
good,"Started when I was young, right out of high school. Got a promotion to sales manager but the job did not pay well and the hours were long. Constant changes in management and high turn over."
good,"I worked there for 4 years, i started out at 10.25 an hour, i left making 10.93. their raises were bogus the entire time i was there. the management sucked, they went through employees left and right."
good,Not happy with Aaron's currently.........under paid for work that is expected and GM is paid too high and not held accountable.  Employees moral low and customers are un happy with service
good,stock the showroom floor and make sure everything is dusted and clean. Answer the phones and take payments over the phone and in store.
good,"employees are ok most of the time, and management isn't much better. they play favorites but the owners are great."
good,The company has a really good meaning behind it and I enjoyed working there and interacting with customers. The downfall to the job was low pay and not much advancement in the company.
good,"People are great. Work is unrewarding, unchallenging and repetitive."
good,Typical day would start with maintaining current accounts and identifying potential customers to grow the business. Provide support to the sales team with product demonstration and information of product specification. Schedule service calls of leased merchandise at customers homes. Count down the registers prior to or after closing of the sales room floor. 
good,I been with Aarons furniture for 5 years I love my job. I love the customers and my employees. 
good,"in at 8am collections calls, follow up with SM and CAM on todays activities, customer service and sales, training, cleaning merchandising the floor, price checking, inventory control, marketing,"
good,"Wouldve been a good job if not for the childishness of the managment staff. Or their unwillingness to allow over time, on any day it was normal to be expected to stay 3-5 hours over but at the end of the week cut your overtime by sending you home early after only working a few hours. As well as sending one person out on deliveries that were undeniably a two person job, i.e. pick up or delivery of reclining sofas and loveseats or side by side refridgerators"
good,"I was the sales manager so a typical day I was in charge of three other individuals (CSR, 2 Drivers). Had daily, weekly and monthly sales goals. Somewhat difficult to hit sales goals because 2 days of the week I would have to go out of the store on deliveries due to staff schedules. Company was strong on the corporate level."
good,Learned how deal with un happy customers. Also learned alot of very good sales skills
good,"I ran my store and it was a very good work environment, I really enjoyed my staff and the work in general, I formed a real bond with 75% of my customer base,  Easy Home Bought up the 4 maritime stores and closed them.  So sad"
good,"The worklife/homelife balance is difficult. The expected performance is attainable and the atmosphere is fairly easy going. The stress level at general manager and above is high, whereas any hourly position the stress is fairly low."
good,Aarons is always pushing you to meet the goal they need you to meet monthly.  There is a lot of pressure put on you to meet that goal which requires late nights and early mornings.
good,"It is a simple job. "
good,This job is not to stressful more on the laid back side work at a higher speed but the what I choose to do my boss is cool when he wants to be and if he’s mad about something he takes it out on his employees
good,I enjoyed my time working for Aaron’s. They went through a lot of changes and turnover while I was employed there. The environment was better suited for my life when I first started.
good,"I like the company, I just got brought in at a bad time, lots of turnover, lack of training, etc.  Got sick and terminated me for excessive absence even with doctors notes.  Don't agree with their ethics.  Lots of hats to wear and responsibility as a sales manager aPnd key holder for not a lot of pay.."
good,"Great company, just had opportunity to open my own business. .So that was the only reason I left the company otherwise I would still be there.  Day to Day it is a stressful environment for a GM but if you put a good team around you then it made it better.  Management sometimes forgets what it is like to work at the store level but overall they do a pretty good job of keeping the operation flowing.  Hardest part was keeping adequate staff and best was the pay"
good,The pay wasn't great and the raises weren't good. A lot of work and stress for the pay. Micromanaged a lot. Training wasn't the best. Advancement was somewhat easy if that was your goal.
good,"The collection environment at Aarons is average with all collections, it's not for everyone.  The sales side can be rewarding not only in compensation for the company but the customers as well.  As the General Manager the company offers great rewards for those who preform."
good,Its a good company to work for if you know how to properly balance your work and personal life. It's a demanding job depending on the position you are in. Store Manager is awesome
good,I would arrive at work at 9 go through all accounts make phone calls to the ones that have not made payment. I learned a new customer care system. i would have to to make field visits to make contact with some customers I Love working with people. the hardest part of my job was having to go to the customers homes and take back the furniture that the customer had in their homes. the most enjoyable is making a connection with the customers and co workers.
good,The work was hard. The lifting and moving in any weather condition was very difficult. You spend a lot of time with the other PT and get to know them like family simply because you spend all day with them in a truck. Taking breaks are difficult because they are hard to make time for. You also have to remember to always be careful because your bringing items in and out customers homes.
good,"this is a great place to work fair wages as well as fun people to work with, fast paced."
good,"No time to go home to family.  Great if you are single, lower pay but higher than minimum wage."
good,it was a job that was demanding and everyday there is some new rules implemented and you never have time for family life .
good,"i liked working there, everybody talked to eachother, everybody worked as a team"
good,"I sit at a desk in front of a computer for 12 hours/day and call people to pay their bills. The greatest part about the job is the lunch break. I was definitely blessed to get this job, though; it's definitely giving me the experience I need to move on to bigger things in the future."
good,"I like to work, and I also like to get paid for what i worked for. I never got paid my incentives for the sales I made. But I was able to learn how to sell and give good customer service."
good,What I enjoyed most aout aaron's that everyone worked as a team to get things done.
good,"A typical day includes delivery, setup and take down of tents, tables, chairs, and other equipment rented for events."
good,"if you are starting this is a good place to start, but if you are looking for a fare place to progress in positions and get notice for your work, forget about it, if you are the regional manager favorite yes you will get better positions but if you don't like to ""kiss a***"" to get what you deserve I recommend to look other places."
good,"My co-workers were great, but having to recover accounts gets to be quite tedious, and often the long work hours cause it to be difficult to have much of a life outside of work"
good,"Do not have much to say about this company . They have new magnament  and new culture.  I didn't work for the new owner or with this team."
good,Ok need better pay.  Currently seeking other employment can't afford the cost of living on my pay rate. Other than this great company.Held several positions at this company and they promote within.
good,"Unfortunately Aaron's still operates under the ""good ol boy"" model. Overall a decent place to build and learn but it seems it was once a great place to be and retire."
good,Not a bad company to work for but salary is low without any sign of immediate advancement. The hours fluctuate and knowing what you are doing that day is non existent. I should point out that the service area is five times the size of typical stores.
good,It’s an okay place to work at. The team and management is all friendly for the most part. Everybody gets the job done at the end of the day. Great vibes good people
good,Learned a lot about testing and challenged me to think outside the box while keeping the requirements mind. Also a learnt a experimented with a lot of tool.
good,They always had you on your toes. I liked getting to see the new furniture before everyone else. I also liked the discount that I was given when I worked there
good,"how to train & develop other,service customer,how to collect money"
good,"Hard work but rewarding. Great lower management. Horrible new COO, interact with all sorts of customers and individuals. Decent pay, but not quite enough for the physicality of the job."
good,"Being a sales manager is a little stressful at some time, cause we deal with the customer to make that sale, keep up filing, manage the service issues, take payments, and keep the floor stocked with merchandise. Not including, managing pt's and csr. I think sales managers deserve a better pay wage."
good,"This was a good job, but we were constantly short and had to work more than normal.  We had to pick up used merchandise from some nasty residences, which made the job worse.  Imagine a fridge filled with old food and roaches!!!"
good,a typical work day at Aarons is very heck tick because we had very bad communication. time went by really quick because we were always busy loading up the truck and making deliveries
good,"Aarons is a great place to work if you don't have a family. IT pays well, but its not for everyone. The managers are good and for the most part training is great."
good,"The main objective is to sell or lease furniture, electronics, and appliances. Process lease order forms/applications. Maintain the showroom floor. There were no benefits in this position. It was just a job with room for commission based on sales."
good,In the CAM office the job can be very repetitive. Your calling and visiting the same group of people that challenge you with their payments that they respectfully owe.
good,Upper managers are good to work with. Jobs like customer service and product techs. get away with too much laziness. Opportunity for growing company customer base.
good,I Work With another product technician Full Time . The hardest part off the job is when you have to go up 2 or 3 story apartment building to deliver a washer and dryer. The most enjoyable part is riding in the worktruck.
good,Great place to work. My problem was that they didn't want to give me a lunch. When out on the road they expected me to buy my lunch and it wasn't in my budget
good,Multiple policy changes that impacted the operations of the business. The hardest part of the job is collecting the company revenue from the lease clients.
good,"A typical work day consist of finding new ways of gaining customers, fulfilling job requirements and maintaing showroom appearance. I've learned how to better market, better assist customers in what they need and can afford while staying within there means. It was a pleasure meeting the ever changing bosses and staff members. I love the job and all I have gained from it and the customers I have made special bonds with they became family seeing them every month and helping them with obtaining things they might not be able to get else where."
good,"I enjoy my time with Aarons, I guess that's why I've been here so long.  Good workplace, with good co-workers.  I think the opportunity for advancement is undoubtedly here, as well as a strong training program with an emphasis on culture"
good,"During a day at Aaron's, As the Assistant Manager you may have to handle multiple services that come into the store or called in. Your job in this case would also be calling customers behind on payments to collect on, also driving to a customer's house to speak to them on their account. You can learn alot if you commit yourself to learning the fundamentals; customer service, accounting, sales, profit/losses, and so much more. Management where I was at was great, we would effectively communicate what was handed down to our employees. The hardest part of the job is a work/life balance; if you do not have a family, then this job will take away alot of your time to have one. the most was the customers! every day a new person who needed help, needed to pay, or just needed to talk."
good,"It is hard to balance work and home if you're married and have kids. Working as a manager trainee was rewarding when goals were met because we received bonuses, but the job requires you to have thick skin and is sometimes physically demanding. I recommend the job for MEN because it appears men are taken more seriously and women doing this job come off as being *witches*"
good,Stress full hard goals to complete. Never work for aarons franchise only corporate.
good,"On a typical day you will clean the showroom, answer phones. Type up agreements be one on one with the customer."
good,there isn't a lot of room for growth with this company that is one of my main reasons for wanting to leave
good,"While working for this company, my job was to get the customers to ownership. I had to make calls, field visit, deliver and return merchandise. I learned that patience is key with everything and to listen to what is being said closely. I would say that the hardest part of the job was not enough family time and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting the customer to ownership."
good,Excellent benefits and salary.  Very little room for advancement at the store level.
good,"After clocking in, I would sit in the office to go over the daily plan. If no one was available in the office, I then would check on the daily planner and start my job duties. Throughout the day I would continue to work on the duties available on the list, unless a customer came in, then I would make them my number one priority. After finishing with the customer whether it was a sale or not, I would go back to the list. Once the list was finished I would then just straighten up around the showroom and/or ask if there was anything else I could do.With a break in between time, with 30 minutes left of my shift, I would began closing to open; vacuuming, getting coffee together, straightening up bullpen, and putting all files away ensuring that everything was ready for the next day."
good,"On a typical day I would go in and do my cleaning schedule. Then I would do my marketing calls and letters to customers,assists the sales manager on the sales floor,and help any customers that are in the store."
good,"This job was definitely one that pushed me to do better. I was constantly under watch to sell and my co-workers helped me better myself and my skills for a professional work place. A typical day was to clean the store, answer phones, file files away into the proper place, and input customers information. I loved talking to the customers and getting to know them. The hardest part for me, I felt like they wanted me to be that pushy sales person and just get the sale no matter what. And that just isn't me."
good,"Work was typically pretty fast paced and the tasks at work varied from selling merchandise to delivering merchandise. Management was fairly poor at the Aaron's I worked at but my fellow co-workers always kept the atmosphere upbeat. The hardest part was adapting to the rent-to-own business type but once you get the hang of it, it is pretty fun."
good,A typical day at work was interviewing possible employees for many different Job openings.
good,A lot of long hours and meeting deadlines. Also a lot of travel from state to state.
good,".A typical day at work would include, turning on all electronics on sales floor, making sure the sales floor is clean, inviting and all displayed inventory is full and ready to be sold with accurate pricing. I would answer and make phone calls all day to answer any customer’s questions and service needs and to verify that all new customers are valid for finance. I learned how to make sales to customers that are not too willing to purchase. Some of the management was great others taught me that you are not as important to the company as the company is to you. I liked my co- workers there was a fast turnover rate so many did not last long. I did end up training 5 out of 6 of my own sales managers. The hardest part of the job would have to be repossessing furniture from families that could not make their payments. The most enjoyable part of the job was always making new friend and returning customers"
good,aarons is a number driven company
good,"aaron's is a great job. a good career opportunity. but the management for the store in garden city, ga is 2faced. she is real shady. i have discovered her true colors. not a good manager."
good,A typical day at work organizing deliveries for later in the day putting products together for later orders. Once im in the field giving clients paperwork to sign recieving payments from clients.
good,My aaron's experience has been mostly positive. There is opportunity for advancement and the job is secure.
good,Can be challenging at times as far as physical demand. Can be back breaking long days. Must be in physical shape. I Recommend back brace. You get hours.
good,Good company they help you though your problems and they work with you and make sure your okay. Aarons is a homey place to wirk. The employees are great and so are the boss man's.
good,This was an ok company to work for. The hours are long and there was lots of driving.  Going and getting furniture people didn't pay for was sometimes a little odd.
good,Aaron's is committed to the communities it serves and increasing awareness about the value of all Americans having access to important household purchases through alternative purchase solutions such as the lease-to-own option.
good,"Aarons is a company where your supervisor really determines what your daily work life will be like.  I worked for several different District Managers, and their decisions had a huge impact on what my work life was like.  Company programs exist; but how much or little they affect what you do is determined by the people over you."
good,You need to be physically fit to work for Aaron's Fullfillment Center. Warm up before starting work because you don't want to injure yourself stacking couches 4 high or loading a 3400 cubic trailers.
good,Over worked and want to add more and more to our daily workload while taking away personel to work the hours needed to hit their goals that are not achievable.
good,"I started in 2005 and at the time the company had a better leadership team at the executive level. After the prior president left the company the culture on which it was founded is also gone. They still pay relatively well, depending on the position. The HR team is heavily influenced internally by the executive officers, therefore it allows for poor treatment followed by clean up control."
good,Overall good experience.  Travel became demanding from approx. 50% to approx. 80%.  A lot of restructuring and realignment within the organization cutting jobs with tenured associates who dedicated their careers and lives to Aaron's with little work/life balance.
good,"Set up accounts team and brief goal setting for the week. Also, get with sales team to complete a huddle and get everyone's behavior and goals for the day to set the proper culture for the store."
good,"Headquartered in Atlanta, Aaron’s, Inc. is a leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, and currently has 1,950 Company-operated and franchised stores in 47 states and Canada."
good,The company was decent to work for but they did not like to let you off on time and when you have a pregnant girlfriend at home it does not work good to stay
good,"Good/fun staff to work with, communication was great, competitive at times in a fun way, laid back boss, pretty flexible when emergencies come up mainly with family."
good,"Repair and clean furniture, appliances and mowers when necessary. deliver and install products for the customer in a professional and safe manner. Meet new people everyday."
good,"The company  has gone through major changes the bigger they have become. Some good, some bad, but continually  changing. This business  isn't  for everyone  and that is  evident due to the major turnover it continues to go through."
good,"Long work days, but working outdoors always had an opportunity to make an impact on people i did not know. I have learned how to advertise the company so that we bring in business. Work place was diverse and people got along. Hardest part of the day was traveling and being stuck but going home at the end of the day was better."
good,I did enjoy working with my customer and got to know a lot of them well. Still see them now to this day and they say they wish i would come back!!! MISS MY CUSTOMERS
good,This company wasn't the best fit because it is primarily a collections position.  requirements included making field visits and returning used furniture and appliances
good,"I've worked at Aaron's for 8 years now it was a good job to start at it was very fun at first. Lots of different kind of people come to Aaron's which makes it fun to interact with them and help get furniture for there families. But now many things in the culture are changing that I have grown out of it and need a new challenge. I'm very thankful for the time with management and employees. The most enjoyable part of Aaron's are the people, and customer. The rapport is the best."
good,"good place to start a career, they promote from within and have excellent benefits. if you enjoy office life and putting furniture together is a good opportunity for you, long hours though"
good,You get sundays off and one weekday. no work life balance. you do the job of two or three people but get paid for one. pay was decent. I would recommend working there if you don't have a family youre trying to get home to.
good,This is a great job if you are starting out your career.  I was hired on but as I worked more and more people were leaving and I wasn't sure why. I did find out the company is trying to get into the 21st century with technology.
good,"Working at Aaron's Sales and Lease I was started right away and the process was pretty easy. it started with computer work(Training) and transferred over to practice what you learn from the computers with the real equipment. the worst part i felt about working for Aaron's as a  Parts Technician was the deliveries. This is because you never knew how hard it would be to get a couch, stove, or any other appliance through the customers door frame or if you have to take a couch up three flights of stairs, the job was very unpredictable and you experience a lot of different home environments. The most enjoyable part of working for Aaron's was being able to get to know customers through talking during the sales process or just talking while they're paying their bill. Another enjoyable thing i found was that the co-workers i had just made the job a lot easier and days got by quicker."
good,I loved the work environment they were so nice the deals were great and the employees were amazing. Great customer service they're really helpful and willing to go above and beyond
good,"Fun environment but a lot of pressure to get items back that customers do not pay for.  Can be stressful at times but have the back up of good people to help out,"
good,"Day to day the job involves calling customers, and making visits to their homes to either collect on their past due balance or repossess their products. If you can't handle any heavy lifting, travel, or hostile customers, don't apply."
good,long hours very demanding made for person with no kids i loved the work environment i love working with people and helping people just im a single parent looking for more time with my kids and good insurance
good,Working at Aarons has been great. my co-workers and management team are all amazing. Everyone gets along pretty well.  Now I'd like to explore new avenue's.
good,Aarons was a good place to work for and fun. The only issue was that pay and i worked long hours and i have small children. But overall I would give the work experience a 7 because the people and he environment was warm and great.
good,it was fast paced and hard work. but it was a good job while it lasted.  people that worked there were fun to work with and it was a decent paying job.
good,the work place environment was quick paced. lots of heavy lifting. but over all a good company to work for. great job security. and lots of room for advancement.
good,"Aarons University is one of the best job training experiences I have ever had.  A lot of time and effort has gone into this program that took years to develop.  If you follow the programs outlined in the training, one could never fail at there job."
good,you can really grow with this company there always looking for great individuals with great community service and collection experience. you just have no life outside of this company
good,depending on how you handle customers and their rudeness determined whether you could do the job or not. I called and made payment arrangements with customers and sometimes didn't get a payment but got the cursing. Sometimes my job consisted of collecting furniture from people that didn't make their payments. It was a tough job at times dealing with customers but working with the people I worked with made the job better. Management was good the only issue was there was no opportunity for advancement in the company. Once a store was set with the management they wanted that was who was going to be there awhile
good,"Enjoyed being presented each day with various maintenance challenges."
good,"Good place to work for but also hard to balance family life with it."
good,I honestly believe in what the company does.  It gives people a chance at getting merchandise they don't necessarily have the opportunity to get and it isn't much different than making credit card payments.
good,"Some days were a lot of fun and laughter and other days were very stressful. It really was based on the General Managers mood and the stress she was under for that day. Mainly a male dominant company and slightly difficult for further advancement. "
good,"Enjoy my position "
good,"Well my everyday life at work is working with new customers. Building lifetime relationships with customer, I am very big on taking care of customers problems and resolving services."
good,"Phones are non stop.  Problems to solve, drivers and stores to assist, claims to file.  Lots of paperwork to sort and file daily. Time management is crucial."
good,really relaxed workplace not enough hours good managment involved going to local events in mascot outfit and helping clean the store when not in mascot suit
good,"good place to start your career, not to stay for long as has long hours and low advancement, managers are over worked and too many responsabilities, sales are good"
good,Very long hours high pressure on achieving results. Great compensation fair to mid benefits for such a large company. While I worked for a franchise owner we followed the corporate structure closely.
good,"I thought it was a great company to work for but the management structure isn't the greatest. There is a lot of lower level management that definitely shouldn't be in the positions that they're in. (IE-CAM's, GM's, ETC)"
good,"hardly home at a decent hour and don't get paid enough for the work being put into the company, would be better if the pay was better."
good,Very flexible work hours and every holiday paid off. constantly moving and active. great benefits and competitive pay. company has great employee and community outreach programs.
good,"Aarons is a rewarding and fair employer."
good,Co-workers become fast friends. Large company but each store has it's own individual flair regarding employees and customer base. Stable daily goals with plenty of new challenges each day.
good,Usually worked between 8-10 hours a day started the day by setting the display floor and then loading the truck for deliveries. Delivered furniture throughout the day according to the schedule. Everyone has an opportunity to move up in the company if they want too. Always met new people but loading heavy furniture over the body/head all day long 5 days a week causes wear and tear on the body.
good,Aaron's was a good place to work.  The problem was there was no work/life balance.  Hours are long. You were always off on Sundays which was a plus but you did have to work on Friday's and Saturday's.  Seem they always set goals that were unattainable.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Aarons over the past year. Fun and friendly atmosphere, good work environment. Have a good relationship with all of the other employees."
good,"A typical work day at Aaron's is fun, interesting and unpredictable. Just the thought of all the emotions that can be experienced in one day is awesome. Especially knowing that you have helped touched or changed the lives of individuals and families who may be down on their luck or just new to a community with out any support, and just being there for them is very self gratifying"
good,"I loved the job, however the current manager was difficult to work with. I loved the daily duties and working with customers."
good,Aaron's is a great company to work for with excellent benefits.  The job requires long hours of high intensity with a culture of success.  The hours are very demanding and not very conducive to family life.
good,"I work in a face paced environment, deadlines and quotas to be met. The day goes by very fast. I work with a department of 8 and they are a great bunch."
good,There was an over abundance of responsibility for each employee working here.  Since the store I worked at was in a small town we did not have the number of employees that bigger stores had but yet we were still expected to keep up.
good,"Stay very busy with filing, organizing and keeping everything up to date. Always able to meet new and interesting people!!"
good,"Competitive, rewarding work environment.  Everyday there is a new challenge and successful individuals can think critically and creatively to overcome.  With this comes great reward for those who can persevere."
good,"Great work environment, not a really big staff, everyone was close and looked out for one another we're like a little family. Everyones work ethic was great and made work go by smooth and nice."
good,Hard worker well liked in office as the manager of 2-5 employees. Designate work to each employee to ensure daily responsibilities and calls are made to reach daily goals set.
good,typical day at work is simple come in check out the route sheet see all the deliveries you have and prepare to load the furniture you will learn a lot about the new items that come in to the store.
good,"I contact about 200-300 customers a day in regards to deliveries and returns, service issues, problems making renewal payments, and concerns and complaints. I've learned a lot about customer service and dealing with difficult customer situations. Love the job overall, just dealing with staffing shortages causes us to have low performance numbers, and doing deliveries and returns in poor weather conditions are the hardest thing about Aaron's"
good,"This position allowed me the ability to fully extend my customer service skills and explore other areas of the retail world. During my time at this position, I was able to learn about new products that benefited the customers as well as my own personal product purchases."
good,Great customer service is our goal. Providing excellent customer service and working around the customers' schedule to help them Own It is how it is done!
good,"I enjoyed working for Aarons for while. After a few changes were made I was working extra but being paid less. Other employees were making mistakes that us delivery drivers had to suffer for. owners would visit and I would be ""sent on vacation"" so I don't ""snitch"". promotions are talked about, but rare but they do offer some great benefits."
good,High energy and motivated company.  Work hard and you will get rewarded.  Moving up the corporate latter is a fairly easy thing to do as long as your work ethic is proves you want it.
good,I enjoyed working there because they had goo benefits and we all the employees seemed to get along. Having a good working enviroment was also another way to make everyday easy.
good,hardest part about this job was  I was too much at work and very little time for my family it would be a 7-9 working hrs everyday sometimes from 6-9
good,Daily I am able to exercise my costumer service skills buy making follow up calls and helping costumers to understand our products. I am able to navigate throughout different areas after the customer selects their product to deliver the item to their desired location. I am able to maintain the offices payment transactions and maintain customers accounts.
good,Great place to help people get the things they can not pay cash for or finance.
good,Great work place and people to work with great overall experience working in sales and collections
good,Amazing place to work and start new relations with new customers and make people happy when they are able to buy something they want .
good,"Learned a lot, enjoyed working with people, interesting business"
good,"Aarons Sales and Lease has been a great company to work for. I am looking to work for the Medical Industry again and would like to find employment in the Ada, Shawnee, Norman, Midwest City area."
good,"A typical day would be coming into work grabbing today's customers folders who go out on delivery and verifying information on the application such as employment, residency and calling personal references. I learned to advance data entry skills and how vital it is to follow up on new information. Hardest part of the job Is trying to maintain enthusiasm for the job when knowing the business is close to being over. Most enjoyable part was the atmosphere, it being laid back and customer oriented."
good,The GM had great bias among the employees and would throw a fit and threaten certain employees for even trying to get a drink and others were allowed to do anything at all that they wanted including sleep or disappear for hours.
good,Great job! I'm a family man and working a lot of hours which doesn't allow me to spend time with my family.
good,"Constant pressure to achieve goals"
good,Long hours is part of this job requirement. few off days. if you can work here plan to look for other job offers.
good,"I would walk in and check the scheduled deliveries. I would then plan the routes within my three team members. I would check to make sure the correct product was staged for the loading of the delivery trucks. While making sure the product was replaced on the floor in the correct manor. After all deliveries were ready I would help load the trucks in the most safe, secure, and efficient way possible. After my drivers left the store, I would then stage for the afternoon deliveries. With any time that I had left, I would repair and clean what ever furniture and appliances needed it."
good,"A typical work day at Aarons was delivering furniture. I learned how to use majority of my weight to complete tasks, that required moving equipment up to high places. There was a good manage staff and I got along with all my employees. The hardest parts of the job was lifting heavy equipment up flights of stairs. The most enjoyable part of the job being selected to work for the employer and being able to come to work."
good,I enjoyed my job. but the management had favorites which made it hard on certain employees. working with the costumers what made the job worth it. learned hard work
good,"Aarons Sales and Lease is a furniture, electronic, and appliance store. We either lease and sale retail. Our days are long and productive. We always have something to do. Its a fun enviroment. Positve management."
good,"basically worked by myself along with store managers, enjoyed traveling, customer service, and OT hours"
good,"Merchandised"
good,"good management, fun co-workers, the hardest part of the day is trying to sell something to a customer and the best part it is when I sell something to that customer and make there days because they get what they want it to get"
good,loved worlking here got to meet alot of cool people and go places ive never been! awesome company and employees.
good,"Very, very busy. The management was awesome, i got along wondrfully with my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was trying to find a time to take a break. I loved the customers, and the mercahndise."
good,The store is a great place to work if you enjoy working with people and putting furniture together.
good,This is a very fast paced and intense work enviromnt. My co-workers love to laugh but we are all very competive. We each have sales goals for the day and we are dedicated to reaching those goals. I work with a diverse group of people. We work long hours and can't help but develop a fondness for each other that remains even through disagreements and mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with my co-workers and the customers in and around the community our business is located in. The hardest part of the job is maintaing morale on slow days. On those days we have to create traffic by marketing and making cold calls.
good,"A typical day at work consists of calling customers helping them to become better at making timely payments on their accounts, also managing the accounts dept. making sure that proper payments or made. I learned that every customer is different an has different situation going on in life an some customers need more attention then others. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is being very rude about his or her payments an don't want to hold up on their end of the agreement, but the most enjoyable part is when the customer finally listens to what I have to say an realize that I'm trying to help them an they leave the store with a smile."
good,same as other review. work with customers to achieve there goals on getting there home stocked up and furniture and electronics
good,very fast paced and fun job.  goals were over achieved.  team work and great management made this company a very fast growing and prosperous company.
good,"The atmosphere and overall interaction with employees and customers is the highlight of this business. It never seems to be same scenario from day to day, A typical day can include a multitude of phone interaction to make and confirm appointments for renewals for agreements and/or scheduling of merchandise repair or return. Job also requires field visits to customer's residences to establish contact with delinquent accounts, counseling and assistance to those in difficult situations."
good,"Delivering and returning merchandise"
good,"A typical day at work involves me selling merchandise to customers.  I receive commission on every sale I make.  I learned a lot of information on privacy and security awareness when I was training for the position. The hardest part of my job is working for my sales manager.  I put in for the position after I had worked here for a year.  My manager told me it was a great idea, as he believes in promoting within the store.  Turns out, he hired someone else from outside the company altogether.  I have to train her on a daily basis for the position I wanted.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to make customers happy. I learn what they want in their homes and I help them reach that goal."
good,Work day usually begins at 10 am and can end at 7 pm -9:30 pm.  Long days.  Spend most days making collection calls or home visits trying to collect on accounts.  Second in command of store.  Co-workers are pleasant and hardworkers.  Hardest part of the job is the work hours.  Not enough time for family.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of working with a client and getting an account paid in full.  Also my co-workers and myself make a good team.
good,"•Acquisition and maintenance of customers"
good,"Limited Advancement  Very Competitive Business"
good,"Job consisted of Monday through Thursday travel across 2,100 stores nationwide with an office day Friday."
good,I was a costumer service rep had to sell and help customers with inquiring 
good,"I did my job and got paid for it. Good company"
good,You have good and bad days when you work here.  You meet all kinds of different people.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers. I like my co-workers, they are all friendly and they are all go-getters. Aaron's is a very professional company, and I have learned my professionalism from them."
good,As for the positions held and job duties I had no problems working at Aarons. I worked for a franchise and the benefits and pay were ok from what I've been told of a corporate store the pay and benefits were better. Management was an issue as was some co-workers. People can make a good job bad and inter office drama is one thing I wish had stayed out of the workplace. The enjoyable parts were meeting new people every day it was a constantly changing environment you had to be adaptable no day was ever the same.
good,I enjoyed working with the public. I was introduced to many people and they were all interesting. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"It was once a company where you could make $250,000 as a Regional Manger. They have reformatted the bonus structure, giving a 40% reduction in pay for all senior managers. All around a great company though."
good,it was an ok job to work at except for the manager would show favoritism toward the receptionists by always buying the meals and bringing the stuff in the mornings such as drinks
good,"great atmosphere, upper management changes mean huge changes on a store level."
good,"Fast Paced Work,Fun Place To Work.The Pay Is Also Great"
good,"sometimes stressful work dealing with angry or upset customers as well as supervisors, they werent always flexible or fair about the hours you had to work."
good,learned how to deal with peoples needs and wants. the hire managers and coorparte from the outside. hard to move up in company
good,"a typical day at work consists of one central theme: the acquisition and maintanence of customers. Everything else done is trivial in comparision. Answering phones all day long, taking payments, verifying customer information, inputing all customer data into their system and keeping up with files are all things that must be done daily. Also, marketing strategies must be implemented (both in store and out of store) daily and any service issues that arise must be handled promptly for each and every customer. The floor must stay priced correctly even with merchandise constantly coming and going from it, as well as making sure everything looks the best it can by properly displaying the merchandise in their appropriate sections with appropriate accessories. It's a busy job!"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work directly with the customers to help them choose merchandise that will compliment their homes and merchandising the sales floor.
good,"enjoyable and good atmosphere. It is a team thing, the sales and collections teams work together to keep the store growing. that is the goal, to grow customers."
good,I loved working there because of the customers. It was not an hard job.
good,"Its a good company to work for, changes are constantly, long hours, fast pace place. if your not use to be fast changing envioramant, this might. not be for you. good benefits"
good,"Most days at Aaron’s were typically routine. Come in, get merchandise ready for inspection and delivery. Deliver to customers then collect any unpaid merchandise."
good,You have to have thick skin to work in the accounts department. You are one on one with the customers. As far as the people you are like family as there are only a few employees.
good,"My biggest issue is work/life balance.  The company is  in leadership transition, and is willing to try new ideas to achieve success.  Unfortunately, the employees are at times overworked, and underappreciated."
good,I obtained sales experience through Aaron's. It's a fun and friendly environment that allows you to be productive while earning a pretty good wage. The only disadvantage is that there's a glass ceiling.
good,The hours are decent not too early and not too late. Downside you have to  work every Saturday and your days off are not often together. Upside you get a decent employee discount on most merchandise.
good,"It really depends on what store you work for, they are all different. Long hours and hard work for not great pay. Lots of training classes and monthly classes. Its like work and school combined sometimes"
good,"I was able to work from the bottom of the company to be a Manager. They do care for their employees, I meet a lot of people to work with and a lot of customers"
good,"Aarons is  a great company, my GM is the best, the Pts Caa Cam are the best. only with commissions they make it hard t get your commission. we not work on Sundays. what part of family life is that. corporate isn't open on Sundays. i love who i work with. just wish they pad more, hard to pay rent and everything else. insurance is high."
good,"Great work environment, weekly paid, discounts thru out the store, management was good they tried to assist everyone. A lot of hours and paid overtime"
good,This was a decent company to work except for such horrible managers and general managers also product technicians do the most work and get paid the lease
good,No room to advance at this job. My option the pay is terrible.  They work you to hard for the pay. Hours are all over. Management  is afraid to rise his voice cause of a law suite.
good,"Long hours, job security is great, good entry level positions, room for growth, management is always cool, day to day always bring new and exciting events."
good,"I am not interested in writing a review for Aaron's Sales and Lease. I worked for the company for 1 year. I enjoyed working for the company, however I needed to make more money."
good,My time working at Aaron's was a fun experience. It all depends on your manager though. My manager was a good one. We would work hard and play hard as well.
good,Overall i think that Aaron's is a good place to work. It had its difficult moments too when moving large heavy pieces of furniture or being in a serious time crunch. Most of the people i worked with were friendly and helpful.
good,"As manager of the store, I had to put in more hours than the average employee. Most employees only work a 40 hour week with every Sunday off as the store is closed."
good,"I didnt like that they made the employees paint and do reconstruction on the store .  They make the employees work in unsafe conditions. Things are broke or ruined and it takes a long long time for it to get fixed.Ive never seen more roaches in a store.  I did enjoy selling and taking great care of customers, and making  all of our goals. My last manager was the best, but he works hard and he doesnt get much help."
good,Work until your body gives out and then work some more or the management will call you names.Injuries are not taken seriously and the expected speed of work is impossible to maintain.
good,Working for Aaron's is a good job and I liked it unfourntly it works out better if your female then Male. The hours are long and dont have much h to me for a family.
good,"This was a good job, I learned a lot, it’s a job for someone wold like to have a nice and simple job, learn how to run a delivering franchise, customer in Service revise, c ?"
good,Aarons Sales and lease is not a bad job if you're a young person that just graduated high school or if you're currently in college. A typical day at aaron's consists of delivering and repairing furniture. The culture of aaron's sales and lease is a good environment the people are fun and very friendly. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy objects. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with good people.
good,I enjoy the interaction with a diverse group of customers.  Being able to assist them in a need that we provide in our store.  I would like for the pay to be equal to the long hours and work that is put in daily.
good,During my time working I learned so much in keeping up with accounts and making sure customer complaints were taken care of. It made me better at customer service
good,Good work environment with friendly staff and good management. Great way to stay in shape by constantly on the move. Place to learn social skills as far as sales and customer service
good,"Contacted 650 of new and existing customers per day to discuss new products and services. Maintained a central database of key contacts, risk ratings, financial impact and key issues."
good,"Upper management makes this job terrible some days. They push and push to attain goals but when you reach them, they wanted to know why you didn't get more. Overall a decent place to work."
good,I enjoyed my time there. They worked with me when I wanted to relocate from South Carolina back to Florida.  A great company to work for but advancement within is very difficult.
good,Salary is low for what I needed. Pay can vary greatly depending on the store revenue for that month. Didn't like working until 7 or 8 every night. Never got 2 days off in a row unless it was a holiday. Management is great though.
good,I really enjoyed the team I worked with. Ownership truly cares for employees but the pay was poor and the hours were long. Overtime is standard and built into advertised pay.
good,Fast paced work environment. Stressful at times. Teamwork not practiced here. Classes are offered ALL the time for training! Extra courses for knowledge.
good,"If you don't mind working from sun up to sun down 5 days a week, this is the job for you. The money is decent but there's a lot of work but not a lot of support."
good,great job to have to get yourself going. the problem is when you advance the more time and stress you gain. you can forget having a off day because you are mostly going to be working. if you like to work always than this would be perfect.
good,I worked in the Ithaca NY store and it was a great company to work for. The compensation was great. The only reason i left 5 years ago was because i got a DWI. Otherwise i would still of been with the company.
good,Nothing is the same each day. What you plan for one day will be opposite the next. This is good for diversity in the workplace. There is never a dull moment.
good,"Very selective in the DFW area when it comes to promotion to GM, they haven't figured out you cant expect anyone to hit a Home Run without letting them swing the bat. Overall its i decent company to work for."
good,"I have been with Aaron's for five years. I love my co-workers, but recently they have completely stopped allowing any and all overtime.  Upper management will listen to our complaints, but no action is ever really taken."
good,Aarons is an interesting place to work.  For a very large company it feels very small.  Each store only has a few employees and thus it creates an environment where you become very close to your peers.
good,I was able to change positions in the store until we found what was best for the company and myself.  If you do not fit they will try to find what fits best
good,I was the first one hired back in March 2005. I learned a lot about teamwork and patience Here. Worked a lot of hours here. No shortage of overtime. Overall good place to work
good,A typical day involves customer service everyday no days are ever the same hitting daily goals and standards set by company.
good,"fast paced always busy and something to do, great bosses and co workers, great training, never a doll moment all ways something new everyday."
good,the job itself was not bad upper management could have taken care of the roach infestation. tools were available to help customers and that was nice
good,"there is a lot of overtime, the management was pretty good, when I worked there my co workers were amazing , benefits were very good as well as the pay, you get raises often as well"
good,"The only bad thing i could think of was the customers. They were rude and everything they returned was completely covered in filth. Little to no advancement, they usually hired new people for higher positions."
good,"A typical day at work includes training and developing managers. Sales and collections. I learned that paying attention to details makes everyone job easier. Management includes several areas,such as, time, productivity, and teaching. I enjoy co-workers because I am only as good as they make me. The hardest part of the job is the time I spend away from family. 12 Hours days 6 days a week. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people."
good,I enjoyed working and helping people.  The business was interesting.  On a typical day we would lease and deliver furniture.  I loved my co workers.  The hardest part about the job was taking back merchandise when customers could not pay.
good,I travel about 75% of the time so a typical week for me starts at the airport. I get to the audit location and begin the audit. Each audit opportunity is unique and I would have to say I broke out of the cube. The work is challenging and the interaction with every aspect of the company is rewarding. If you do not want to succeed do not work here. Work life balance is a challenge.
good,I wish my co-workers liked their job more. It would make it more enjoyable and that our customers always came first. I really enjoy when I get the chance to connect with the customers and make their experience personal.
good,"This is a job with long hours. It can be stressful depending on your position. 50% pleasant customer interaction, 50% unpleasant. This is not your typical retail or sales business. This is Lease to own. Maximum commitment means maximum reward."
good,"A typilcal day at work would be making calls in the morning to customers who were behind on their payments. We would also help customers as they come into the store to make their payments. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are rude and impatient. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have satisfied a customer.  My co-workers were great, and management was great as well. I learned people skills more than anything with this position because you deal with a wide variety of people, and also was even able to become slightly more comfortable with speaking and understanding Spanish."
good,The people I had the joy of working with made the day go by quicker which is good. Some customers you have to work you just have to look at them and bit your tongue.
good,"A day at Aaronswould be clock in at 10:00am, to then look over the delivery route book, which consist of delivery's, services ,and returns."
good,"Get there at 9am set out your goals for all departments and from that point on it's all about sales, growth, accounts receivable, inventory, customer service, managing front show room floor, back warehouse, and closing contract. "
good,"You will get what you give."
good,"it was a great company to work for, with hard economic times it was hard to produce sales"
good,I have worked for Aarons going on 2 years. I love my upper management but strongly dislike that I am unable to progress in the company in any way possible  because of my age.
good,"Great job, the stand behind there product Loved the people that i worked with and the people i met"
good,region level and lower are not hired from the outside. must start at a trainee level. region level compansation is good.
good,"Great company, but long hours. Not family oriented company!"
good,"Load murchandise, deliver murchandise, return murchandise, survice, murchandise. Great people to work with and for."
good,"A typical day starts with looking at your delivery schedule to see what will be delivered that day. Next you move any furniture in the show room that's being delivered to the back of the warehouse while replacing the merchandise you just moved with new or used items. and then go about loading the items being delivered onto the truck. Now starts the fun part delivering and setting up merchandise. You will deliver refrigerators, living room sets, bedroom sets and my least favorite of all front load washers and dryers. Other parts of the job will be picking up returned merchandise and cleaning it (get ready to get your hands dirty) and doing minor repairs. This job has its benefits; it's not a difficult job and most of the time you'll be on the road so the day goes by faster. If your quick on your feet, a hard work, and like the open road. This is the job for you."
good,"Aarons is a good company to work for.The people are great,the pay and benifits are good and the work is rewarding,but the hours are long."
good,"good co-workers, managament is good and as long as you stay busy the time flies"
good,typical work day is just mostly driving every day which is cool you learn differnt things mostly from customers management is great co workers are great know how to work as a team hardest part of job would be the long hours and only two day off enjoy the fat checks though
good,"the staff at the Grovetown Store was very fun, engaging, and likable."
good,"Great place to work, unless you have a family or a personal life. The amount of hours required and the pay level for these associates needs to be addressed. Great opportunites for advancement but fail one time for something that's not your fault and you are no longer that great associate who was once promoted. Work ethic and loyalty should be something they would want in their culture, and unfortunately it is not. Great place to work if you want a job, but not a career."
good,"I enjoy the job for the most part. Always looking to better myself though. I like the fact that there is a set schedule and there is enough people to get a heavy work load done. The pricing, quality, quanity, and variety of the product makes Aaron's a beast among the rental/lease world."
good,the company was good to work for just lots of changes with management
good,"Good job i guess, just no life outside of work. Never have time do do anything else. Hours are all day long with an hour break."
good,Fair compensation. Reliable steady work. Daytime work hours. Reasonable and understanding management regarding personal life and unexpected occurrences. Friendly tight circle of employees. Good work/life balance. Friendly understanding owner of the Seymour In. Franchise.
good,Good pay and great benefits but very stressful and not a good work/life balance. It was a family friendly company at 1st then over the past few years it changed and it was all working and no time off!!
good,I thought Aaron's was a great job I started as a truck driver and  became a great accounts manager and learned how to deal with customers and earned more patience I didn't think 13 an hour for that kinda work was fair
good,"I went from in home health care to a job in sales. It was similar in some ways but very different in others. I've always thought I was a fast learner, but as I was working at Aarons I had to humble myself and caught myself asking someone for help (which isn't something that I like to do) There was so many things to learn and so many different ways of doing it, but after getting settled in I really like my job and of course I have some GREAT customers which is what Aaons is all about, taking care of our customers and making them feel special because without them we wouldn't have a pay check."
good,It’s fun to work with the team but it is a very competitive corporate company and all numbers must be excellent to have job security. You learn a lot about furniture quality and market value.
good,"Excellent people to learn from. "
good,"Arron's is a great company to work for, except for the time of employment the regional managers for the company acted like tyrants. Even with a store in the green on both ends of sales and accounts they still would treat you like you were not doing a job well done, One major flaw i did not like was regional could come in your store on fire and hire who ever they wanted to even your most devoted hard working staff that was helping you achieve all your goals. Was the ultimate reason why i left the company."
good,"Easy company to work for, room for advancement, steady work, management styles change too rapidly causing cultures to do the same.  Company policies and procedures have changes multiple times in the past year making it more difficult to pursue advancement.  Compensation and benefits are below competitor standard."
good,"It is hard work, but it can be fun, and there is definitely opportunities to make very good money.  Doesn't offer a lot of time with family. A lot of hours."
good,"No work home life balance for family oriented people. Other then that if you are willing to put in the grind , Aaron's will have your back the Rms and ad's are great"
good,"Aaron’s is currently undergoing a business transformation with a new vision for future growth. Upgrading new stores to reflect our new product line and the new vision of what Aaron’s sees moving forward. "
good,"I helped customers with furniture and electronic sales and leasing. Customer services was big part of the job and sales marketing. I learned a lot at Aaron's because it was really my first real full time job. Everyone I work with there were great and we all worked together as a team to get thing done daily. Hardest part was loading trucks for deliveries because sometimes they were on sales floor and had to be moved, replaced, cleaned, and re-price but was part of job. Most enjoyable was during the holidays because of joy and events that we plan."
good,"Enjoy helping people out who might be in a tough financial situation, credit history wise.  As an Account Manager you see a lot of individuals that will not always be truthful with you and give you empty promises."
good,"Good company to work for. Excellent place to work if you're trying to get managerial experience. Way upper management change their minds all too often, kind of makes it hard to keep up with what they want. other than that, good company to work for. definitely would recommend as entry level management..."
good,I enjoyed my time at Aaron's. I leaned a lot of helpful things that grew me as a manager.  Benefits and pay were good and the leadership does give you the opportunity to grow within the company
good,"Aarons can be a great place to work if you bring the correct attitude and expectations.  "
good,"Excellent Leadership Skills"
good,I have been with Aarons for several years. Every day presents a new challenge. You get out of it what you put in. I love meeting new people and interacting with my employees. The atmosphere is conducive for healthy competition which brings everyone together to accomplish our goals. It is hard to get people to come into stores because of online shopping.
good,"I spent 10 years with this company, and saw the company change several times over. Everyone trying to re-invent the wheel. There was a proven program already in place, and worked great. Culture was top notched, and management staff wanted to see you succeed. Hardest part was the amount of hours, as a manager, you were guilt-ed in to working. Individual performance was on the down swing, and your store's average helped with under performing stores. Compensation and bonus structure were extremely competitive with management."
good,I am interested in a career in the medical field. This is irrelevant to my new job search success! When I worked at this company it was a very good company to work for.
good,This jon required you to deal with several accounts that at some time would be stressful . The pay for this job was fairly. Overall the job was pretty good.
good,"I would work for them again.  They pay well and follows the rules.  They promote from within, and have extensive sales and collections training.  Paid vacations.1"
good,Although work days are long you are compensated based on your performance. Getting the job done efficiently leads to large paychecks. You need to insure quality time with family to keep fresh
good,"I love this company, and if you love to work then Aaron's is the place for you! I love my store, and my colleagues as well we have a lot of fun, and get stuff done. I don't enjoy working crazy hours, and having zero time outside of work otherwise Aaron's is the best!"
good,hours vary everyday. You have to stay until the job is done so if you have to have a set start and stop time this job may be difficult. Managers are nice and will work with you as much as they can. There are many opportunities to advance if you want to and work hard enough.
good,"Good development. Sometimes lack of foresight. Management overall is solid, but depends on who you have day to day.  Some decisions are made in a way that makes no sense, like any other type of company"
good,But expected to much for little income 10 an hour doesn't cut having to worry about what's going on in the store deliver what I need to and stay later
good,"ok to work with, some managers are great others are not so, I enjoyed the people that I was dealing with, it was a pleasure to help out people and see the look on there face when I was able to help them"
good,"worked with a small friendly staff. had over 500 customers. dealt with customers on everyday bases. 3rd party collections. moved a manager in training to acct manager, and sales manager. hardest part of the job is having to take back people's merchandise as they have fallen on hard times"
good,"Team Players, Upper Management was disengaged with employees and customers. GM does not know how to work and address employees in a proper manner.This resulted in a high turnover"
good,Aarons was big on the culture of the company and i liked that. I knew about the company inside and out before i was fully trained on the job. The work was tiresome lifting furniture up and down three flights of stairs almost ten times a day. The thing that made the job enjoyable was to provide a customer with great service each and every time you come across them. Good work meant you were remembered by the customer and they always would provide us with great reviews.
good,My regional manager tries to make sure that we are happy but the company hours take their toll. working 9am-9pm leaves little room for anything else. Plus the job is already tiring from being so physical.
good,"job requires working with shady clients, and involves using shady tactics. Aaron's tries to only sell products to low income communities(people who cannot afford to finish their leasing contract), that way they can milk clients for as much money as possible before repo reclaims products for resale."
good,"Great lease to own company to start your career in sales, hours are not flexible for most locations but commission is given for all sales.  Health benefits offered and management on sites obtained their positions by sufficient knowledge and background of the company. Team member oriented along with fast paced environment."
good,"A typical day at work is greating customer in store and over the phone,collect payments and some deliveries.My main focus is to grow the store and collect a high volume of payments."
good,Aarons is a good place to work if you like a challenging environment constant train and implementation of new policy
good,"I have been grateful to work at Aarons for the past year and a half. My general manager is very generous, has challenged me to become my best and as a result I have been able to be counted in the top 20 of all sales reps in our region for several months this past year.  The benefits package is good, the only downside is the tradeoff on the high hourly pay versus commission: because Aarons does offer a generous hourly rate and benefits, commissions are a bit low."
good,"Typical day consisted in assisting customers, ensuring all deliveries were set to go out and in order per the schedule listed. Following up with all leads to ensure that references were set before merchandise went out the door for delivery. Following up with CSRs and Delivery Drivers to ensure goals and objectives were set for the day. I learned how to be able to set my processes in an environment that was always keeping me on my toes, and learned to adapt with every change that came my way. The hardest part of the job was just ensuring that the customers were taken care of, and that the systems stayed updated with the ever changing procedures/processes to keep things organized to effectively do our jobs. The best part of this job was the fun and open relationship that all of the employees had with one another. No one was made to feel less than anyone else, and we all had a lot of fun while still being able to focus on our tasks to take care of the store."
good,I've worked here since 2012 and I have to say the way things are done in the company are a lot different now than what they were when I was hired. It's not a bad company to work for however it doesn't allow for a lot of home time.
good,"On any given day I would handle inventory controls, product assembly, loading of trucks daily, following proper routes to locations, safe and efficient delivery and implementations of furnishings and appliances."
good,"was enjoyable and easy going"
good,"A typical day at work involved making sales calls, collecting customer payments, dealing with customer issues over the phone, cleaning the sales floor and furniture, and resolving customer complaints. There was also a fair share of helping with set up of displays on the floor. Moving furniture was a definite and sometimes you help stage merchandise and set up as well. I learned that most people have bad attitudes, but some people are honest and easy going. Management could use some work, but for the most part they are considerate and helpful. My co-workers were knowledgeable and fun to be around most times. The hardest part of the job is the multitasking about customer complaints and dealing with idiots. The most enjoyable part of the job is attaining your sales bonuses and watching movies in your down time."
good,it was a great experience if you like meeting new people ever day and a exciting atmosphere and there always something to do
good,I liked the corporate structure and explanation of daily responsibilities from top down and their online training program. But I do not like the fact that because they only promote from within it's easy to get stuck with a manager who has no management qualifications or training. Having studied management styles and techniques I find it difficult to work for someone who has none.
good,I love Aarons the customers are so wonderful to help and the crew I work with is like family I have been there for over 5 years and the management staff could be a little better but other then that I like it a lot.
good,"A typical day starts in the morning to review previous day's results,plan for the rest of the week and a team cheer to get the day started.Prioritizing the delivery schedule, service call's and communicating responsibilities to employees.I learned to grow my own business,and provide excellent service to customers.I hired like minded individual's,resulting in a fun and productive atmosphere.The hardest part of the job was the work schedule,i worked from 9 am to 8,six day's a week,it left little time for my family.I really enjoyed the manager meeting's in April."
good,The office performed it's daily duties without supervision and outperformed other comparable operations in the Company. The Division's goals were sometimes placed on the back burner because of Corporate directives from Home Office. This was the hardest part of the job in staying focused on the goals that had already been established.
good,"A nice place to drive and make a little money doing so get some experience in and gets you prepared for future jobs and gets your foot in the door for most jobs. Co workers are nice so are the managers very proffesional, a good day at work would be often drive to locations and everyone helps each other out"
good,Learned alot about account management and working with customers to make timely payments to make it to ownership of merchadise
good,Requires a lot of face to face interactions.  The bonus program is good and the training is great.  All you need is work ethic and persistence and you will be on your way to the top.
good,A typical day at Aaron's was a busy day sales and collections and employee relations. Keeping track and controlling inventory making sure vehicles were in safe working order. Making sure the store was clean and presentable to customers and that merchandise on the sales floor was priced and tagged properly. Making sure customer call backs for accuracy delivery times and due dates was correct.
good,"I enjoyed working with my team while being productive though out the day. I liked driving my box truck and learning my way around Providence and Pawtucket. I've had to calm down angry customers and come to mutual agreements which was at times challenging but I enjoyed using my problem solving, communication and customer service skills.The hardest part of the job was never leaving at my scheduled time although I did not mind the overtime, family time is equally as important and I would have liked to be home at the end of my shift at least twice a week."
good,"The vision is there..."
good,You work collections and sales daily.  The worst part of the job is going to visit peoples houses.  A lot of very dirty places.  I learned a lot working for Aaron's.  I went around to different stores and helped out several other General Managers with inventory and other aspects of the business.
good,"I enjoy working at Arron's, there is a family atmosphere in the workplace and I love the sense of accomplishment when you are able to help customer's with there needs."
good,"Company that is rewarding on a daily basis. However, advancement opportunities are scarce and different supervisors prefer different policies be followed. Over all Aaron's is positive environment and a fine place to work."
good,"I would typically open the toe and get everything out and turned on by myself. work on files, make sales, take payments, and answer phone calls throughout the day. Management wasn't always fair. They always had their own set of rules for the managers, then the rules for the sales reps, and then another set of rules for the people in the office. They like to put a lot of the responsibility on members of nonmanagement. The hardest part of the job was selling enough to actually bring home some money. I made close to 100 sales a month and brought home about $230.00 a week plus a $250-300 commission check that came in once a month."
good,Making calls is a typical day for me . Management could be better (listening) . The hardest part of this job would be for me everybody needs to do there jobs. The most enjoyable part for me would be meeting new people
good,"great job, learn how to manage customers at a face pace environment,"
good,"It's not for everyone. If you don't like long hours or seemingly impossible goals to meet, then it's not the place for you. If you do like working under pressure and not having a personal life, except on Sunday's...Well more power to you! I left because I got tired of commuting 120 miles a day as the store I managed was 60 miles away from where I lived."
good,"Aaron's does value it's employees. However, they require a lot of time from you, so work/life balance is not very good. They love to promote from within, and once you get to the GM level, compensation can be very good."
good,"This started off as a super fun job. Great people, great work environment. But after a year the store I worked at got really shaken up with the dismissal of some of the staff. The replacement staff where able to fit in and things quieted down. I started as a Delivery driver and worked my way up to a Customer Accounts Manager in a little over a year. I was even offer my own store, but I politely declined as I didn't feel that I was qualified at the time. Shortly before reaching my 3 year anniversary I was let go for a very odd reason. Which kind of left a bitter taste in my mouth. The only saving grace is that my termination was not due to my work ethic or abilities and the GM of the store did not want to have me terminated, it was a decision made by a person of higher standing than himself."
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers acquire products for their homes, keeping monthly accounts renewed in a timely manner and helping team members stay on point in their respective areas ranging from account management to sales and marketing to product delivery and setup."
good,Aaron's a great place to make a career or a place to maintain an adequate lifestyle. I have learned that the retail industry is a very competitive and aggressive environment. The management there is knowledgeable and professional. Co-workers are excellent and seem to have a thirst for knowledge. The hardest part of the job would have to be the changing schedule and hours of operation. The best part is working with the public.
good,A good place to work but the lengthy hours are a negative.  The people are very friendly and the opportunity for advancement is there but you have to apply yourself.
good,"This company is great, a good place to work with many opportunities, left because they moved."
good,i really enjoyed my job at aarons but be prepared to be stuck doing entry level work for a long time because they don't hire from within most of the time
good,"During my time with company i was provided the ability to work hard and move up in the company. And acquire the skills listed below:"
good,A great place to work but not a good team worker there.work all different kind of weather. Have good customer service with customer.
good,"I love my job as a asst. manager but I honestly feel like I may need a change! Sadly, Aaron's Sales and Lease is not becoming a huge growing business anymore. Which becomes a problem for me I enjoyed my typical work day when, agreements were being typed, people were being closed in agreements, mainly the fact of being able to use my customer skills. I have learned so much with in this company and I am very thankful for that but i feel like I am at a stoping point of not learning anything else, somedays I find myself teaching the general manager how to do certain things! Within my time spent at Aaron's I have not only made co-workers but very close friends that I will keep the rest of my life reguardless if I stay within the business. I do have to say though there was hard times within the company, mainly a physical part. I can pull my weight just not move sofa's and loveseatson my own. Yet, all in all i do have too say my two years of being employeed here has been well worth it. I just hope to better my career and enhance my life as well as my families."
good,"Work days were very productive."
good,It was fun learn a lot about leasing management was great for awhile until one of our RM left the best one(Phil) love the co workers we were like family and still in contact with co workers.There was nothing hard about the job.Working with Costumers and making their life enjoyable with smiles and Great Costumer Service.
good,"Working with Aaron's hasnt been that bad. My day consist of getting merchandise on and off the showroom floor. Cleaning and touching up returned merchandise. Also making sure the deliveries are made on time everyday, The management team has seen its changes and so far its getting better, there for a while the moral had dropped but we all pulled through it and its working out alot better. My co-workers are pretty good, im currently training our new guy on handling and loading the merchandise to the truck and then to the customers home. "
good,"Is a good business, but a tough one where hard work gets rewarded."
good,"I am a hardworking individual, who is in search for her right career path."
good,"open store, plan out day and line out empolees, working with customers,"
good,did a lot of physical labor but enjoyed the job and co-workers
good,was fun place was very busy day calls made for collections products rotation customer service
good,fun and nice place to work but they need to up the pay to even it out.
good,"Aaron’s was an overall pretty good place to work, other than higher ups not understanding that you can’t make 20 sells a day, every day. Very numbers driven company and they seem to care a little more about that than customers or employees"
good,"Aaron's is very goal oriented, hard work pays off, but location is the only way to make any real bonuses.  Small towns forget it.  Management is great, always there when needed. Training programs are the best I've seen. Really a good company to work for"
good,"I enjoyed working there because the managers are so great there. These so few of y’all working there that you work with the same few people everyday & start to create relationships. It’s great in the aspect of having a decent job. However, they began cutting my hours when I left as basically a punishment for my store not collecting Aaron’s Corporate desired revenue (which is why I left ultimately). Overall not a terrible place to work but I’d explore options"
good,"I like Aaroms, Compensation plan is not the greatest. You do not get paid on performance other than being paid hourly. I'm use to earning based on my work ethic"
good,"A regular work day would consist of trying to move as much merchandise out of the store as possible, this includes speaking to every customer and calling customers to add on more merchandise. Sales has the benefit of giving you a small amount of commission depending on how well your team does that month and what you sell. On top of doing other tasks the manager requests such as lifting objects and cleaning"
good,"Aaron's was a good company to work for, being that they did allow quarterly training courses to better your position. They also had great benefits and allowed you to promote within  the company where they see fit."
good,"Aarons corporation had a specific drive for their employees. Franchise owners lacked the same drive, and in some cases did not offer the same benefit packages. Example: Refusal to allow employees to utilize FMLA"
good,I enjoyed my job here. The hrs are long and physical tuff. The lefting really wears me down. Sales and accounts is the best part of my long days. Very friendly coworkers!
good,"Aaron's offers many associate benefits, they are flexible when it comes to needing time off, and everyone is friendly and willing to help when it's needed. A very team oriented company."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Aarons Sales & Lease. I would have to say one of my favorite places of employment. When I was injured, I couldn't carry on with the company until I healed. I have been really considering going back."
good,It's a fun place to work at competitive pay. There is always something to do.The people that work their make it fun and enjoyable to go to work. The hardest part about working there is loading and unloading of the merchandise.
good,"I can only say that Aarons has been a good company to work for. I can only say that it's the staffing issue and compensation for the employees. All in all, it's a good company with Benefits."
good,"Busy, always something to do. There are good days and there are bad days due to whatever situation is happening in the lives of the customers. Co-workers were fun and helpful. Management helps with questions and concerns, they guide to help advancement within the company"
good,"Aaron's hours are not the best but the jobs are great."
good,"After high school I started working here. This job showed me how to take care of customer problems in a quick way, I learned how different products worked and what products to recommend. I also learned how to handle paperwork and new customer files."
good,I had a lot of fun working for Aaron's.  I loved my coworkers and met many awesome customers.  I enjoyed the work but the pay wasn't were I needed it to be.
good,I have been with the company for over 10 years....overall the work atmosphere is good I just feel that the hours as a manager are long and takes away from a good quality of life with family. I also feel that the incentives and bonuses could be much higher along with the pay. Overall Aarons is a great company to work for with room for advancement within the company
good,"Everyday was pretty much the same"
good,"I worked at a franchise, the reviews I gave are want I think they could be if the franchisers I had were not involved.The pay was decent the opportunity for advancement was there.One of the franchisers just made it very hard to work there."
good,"A typical day at work was moving furniture, cleaning, taking payments, learning the company, and selling the merchandise. I learned how to have good customer relations, and ways of the company. The management was nice, and had good relationships with the other workers. The culture was lax, and was overall a good place to work. The hardest part of the job was moving the furniture and keeping up with the new company policies/ways of the workplace."
good,"Talking,walking, an lifting"
good,Aarons was high paced everyday. What I enjoyed the most about Aarons was being out on the road delivering product ti the customers homes and interacting.
good,Fun open environment. Needs new management at my store. Would like better response time when requests are made. Need more leeway when making decisions. Management shouldn’t be so focused on making numbers
good,"Great managers but they pay newer, less experienced employees more money.  Benefits are excellent and new employees get 2 week vacation along with sick and personal leave."
good,"See resume. Hardest part of the job was arriving to work one morning to find that we had been sold to a competitor company. All Aarons employees were absorbed by the new owner, however the standards of business with the new owners was far below the standards we were accustomed to."
good,I liked the set hours and the ability to advance in the company. I learned more about sales management and making contracts. Hardest part of the job was cleaning the show floor alone.
good,i really liked the job. i was really good at it and it worked with my home life too. but a new manager got hired and she was a huge female dog lol. and dealing with her was not worth the pay and my time so i left for another job. but it isn't a bad job at all. just that maria is unbearable.
good,Aarons training  was  absolutely wonderful. They invested a lot of time and money in  making sure their employees knew the  product and the  procedure.
good,It was a good atmosphere was a fast-paced jobs never never boring day great management competitive pay nice bonuses company was nice during the holidays
good,i think the store i worked at at that time was just had problems with management and on how things should of been runned but i believe that if the owner  knew about it he would of done something about it i at least hope
good,Well maintained but needs proper maintenance for store. Employees have to conduct work out of their job descriptions. Lack of management discipline to out of line employees.
good,"Overall I enjoyed the job itself. I learned a lot about sales, and marketing. I loved my staff. Everyone got rewarded as needed. "
good,"you get to meet a lot of people during the job. You learn how to fix appliances, and how to move furniture and appliances around a house without causing damage to anything. you can buy anything from the store for less and very easy to make something of your self."
good,Good place to work but tough job for the pay. Alot of hours and responsibility for the compensation. Good culture and support and ok benefits. Good starting place to get some management experience.
good,"Among all the jobs I have held this particular position  left an unforgiving outlook on the company and its upper level management, Lesson learned. Rent to Own is not the career for me"
good,"Great company! Plenty of advancement opportunities, especially if your willing to relocate. Always closed on Sunday's and if your the GM or RM you can have weekends off."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for Aaron's and would love the opportunity to relocate as a GM to another location in the Hampton Roads area.  I have never once thought about leaving Aaron's and have loved my time here as well as the people I work with.  I enjoy the fascinating parts of dealing with customers daily and the joys and problems that can arise day to day.  There is a level of satisfaction you feel when you know that you've been able to help someone for the good,  The only reason I am thinking of leaving is due to some personal issues and the need to move closer to home to be with ailing family."
good,Wonderful place to work with great experience. I have learned many new skills and get to constantly move forward looking after customers and their needs.
good,"Everyday at work is a day to learn something new. Begin the day by reviewing duties for the day or week and determining proper steps to fulfill the tasks involved.  Professional growth and independence have become my greatest lessons learned on the job. Although I haven't held a management title, being able to train others in areas where I am proficient are my management skills that I possess. My social personality and ability to get along with others make me an outstanding coworker. The hardest part about my job would be the time away from my family but they are more than understanding of my willingness and determination to work and provide for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I have satisfied customers with the service I have provided, giving myself as well the company a good name."
good,"good job, hours weren't ideal for family time. work conditions sometimes weren't ideal, benefits were nice. would work for 9 hours each day."
good,"Really awesome place to work. Had awesome upper management, great bonus structure. Its a very competitive environment and they always have contest and you win free lunch and or money."
good,Fast paced with some slow days in which we do field visits when no deliveries. Friendly staff and management that are willing to help if assistance is needed. Hardest part of the job is time management and sometimes trying to properly get furniture into a customers home. Most enjoyable part of the job is no micro management.
good,"-Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know frequent customers"
good,"Worked in the corporate office.  Enjoyed working here.  Company is growing and changing, which is causing a change in the culture for the better."
good,A typical work day is about 11 hours of customer service and managing the team. I am in charge of all the service and also making sure the deliver guys have everything they need when they leave the store. The best part is helping the customer pick out there new furniture and explain all the benefits of it and making sure that they leave with a smile and a new friendship with us as a company.
good,"Job is busy and fast paced. Always in motion, half physical and half non-physical. Supporting users at multiple home offices, divisional offices, and stores."
good,Challenging but enjoyable. Manager and co-workers are great to be around. Did not like having to repo furniture from families with small children and the elderly.
good,"I really liked working for the GM, he was a pretty great boss as were the rest of the team in store. Unfortunately upper management didn't listen to us, and complained when we weren't doing well even though we knew why we were failing. Typically slow due to where we were but it was a fun job overall. Learned about filing and expaned my CRM skills."
good,Overall good company to work for. They have great benefits! I love the community involvement and the good things they do for people in need!
good,"working for Aarons was pretty great at first, but then management started having me work till 11 at night when it was time to go home by 7. It made it difficult for me be with my child considering that at the time i was a single mother."
good,This position was a fun position.  The manager was great about teaching new sales techniques.  The staff was great.  They were always ready for a laugh to get through the day.  Manager was concerned about each staff member and family needs.  Manager would answer as many calls and assist with customers anytime.
good,"Overall decent company to work for. Depeneding on your style and whether you enjoy working with people the store jobs versus the warehouse are both very different. The hours at the store typically are longer and weekend work hours are pretty much every week. They do give all employees off on Sundays but everyone pretty much works every Saturday. The hours per day average 9 to 10 hours typically from 9am to 7 or 8 pm. You do recieve an hour lunch but like most I would have rather had half an hour and gone home sooner. The warehouse differs in that the work day is typically 8 hours starting at 5 or 7 and ending by 3:30, with a half hour lunch. The warehouse associates are off weekends. Of coarse the warehouse is physically demanding and you are constiantly busy but some enjoy the non people oriented enviroment."
good,"As a numbers based company it is all about the bottom line, I excelled in the collections department as well as led a number 1 sales department. I loved working for this company and would return to them in a heartbeat."
good,"My responsibilities for Group Success International included growing the company in sales by providing the customer with knowledge of water and air purification systems.  Closing deals with regular home owners, corporations, and small businesses."
good,The worst part about the job is the hours aside from that its pretty cool customers are always nice and happy I enjoy serving there needs.
good,"this was a good job, but i think they could pay their employees more. they expect a lot out of you. Also they can do better with their raises as well."
good,Aaron's can be a great place to work if you have all team players. Management can be stressful when you are short handed and the hours can be long. I enjoyed what I learned there and I loved the people I worked with.
good,"Overall not a bad job.  Once you have worked in management in this field, you feel you can take on anything.  Daily challenges keeping customers happy, from payment issues to service opportunities.  Keeping the departments focused daily was also a challenge."
good,Easy and simple job with good coworkers and a flexible manager. I have nothing bad to say about this place because it wasn't that bad at all.
good,Dove company box truck to deliver furniture to customers. good working environment with good co workers. Good hours and nice box trucks to drive
good,Very good company to work to work for. Good advancement opportunities and compensation on management level.  Only issue would be work/life balance in management positions. It is a sales and collections business at its core.
good,"The franchise I work for has an extensive knowledge of the business - every facet, every aspect and every program.  With more than 15 years in the rent-to-own business, I thought I knew a lot.  This franchise is chocked full of experienced executive level managers who can train, support and guide all managers to a successful business."
good,Open and close the facility.  Conduct weekly morning meetings among co-workers.  Clean/repair damaged merchandise.  Make sure the show floor and warehouse were clean and organize.  Collect payments/deposited to the bank.  Open and close customer accounts.  Make weekly work schedules and delivery schedule.
good,As a DC manager I was given the freedom to make business decisions. They allow you to grow and that's a definite plus. I was able to gain a lot of experience and for that I am thankful.
good,"You can advance, however a ""Good Ole Boy"" mentality still exist within this company. It's not for everyone"
good,Nothing really bad to say about this place. Over time the company is pretty much family. Great place to work whether you're fresh out of high school or looking for a career.
good,As an account manager normal day started by calling past due customers and delinquent accounts. Great fast paced environment. Long hours hardly any time off. Sundays you will be off which is a plus and one day during the week.
good,Aaron's is a great place to work.Work is not very hard and the supervisors and managers are good to work for.
good,This was my first job and I felt I learned so much from this experience. I felt the staff worked around my schedule.
good,"Working with public has its moments. This job is challenging, customers vary on any given day,"
good,"High level of customer comunication, have to be a happy and willing to like this job to be able to  accomplish daily task"
good,"10-12 hour days, Customer relation skills, manage and handle accounts, Management is good but you might have to go somewhere else to get answers or to get just anything lol, co workers are accounts and sales people not one crew or team just two or three different groups, Just like high school for some reason. nothing is hard about the job and the most enjoyable part is being able to make your our career, even thought they say it takes less then a year to get a store they make it in about two years to a store"
good,A typical day of work for me is to make sure my drivers are set up to deliver the merchandise on time to ensure customer satisfaction. I make sure my Sales Manager has a plan for the day so we can hit our sales goals. I personally hold a strategy meeting with my accounts department so we can hold each other responsible for hitting the goals that are set in the meeting. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my customer happy because we are committed to their satisfaction.
good,"look into files find my customers merchandise they ordered"
good,I have tried to advance with this company on numerous occations and have been given no results on my inquiries. The pay is ok for someone who has nothing else but for the aspects that the job requires the pay is definitely lacking. The benifits are extremely awesome. I would recomend this job to a friend but I need something else.
good,its  is a very nice place to work the people there are very nice
good,"70-80% driving and delivering. Rest was setting/prepping new furniture and showroom. Actual management wasn't that hard to get along with. The were experienced and on the up and up. The hardest part, being a newer store, was the constant, even back and forth, shift in mine and the stores job and responsibilities. I did not always know what I was supposed to be doing, so I had to look for things. The best part was I got to know the area well and nothing was impossible to get done."
good,"Typical Day: Lots of phone calling, almost 800 customers."
good,"Show up around 10am and leave about 7pm, with a one hour lunch."
good,I enjoyed working for Aaron's because I had a chance to interact with different people on a daily basis. The pay wasn't the best but the job was fun.
good,"Responsible to drive area sales and profit plans to budget through successful leadership, organizational plans, customer service, and understanding execution of all field operations strategies, consistently across all stores."
good,Aaron's is a great Rent to Own company with ample opportunity to advance. The pay and hours are very competitive for similar retail positions.
good,"Working in-store on merchandise cleaning, Staging, Deliveries, Collections, and ect..."
good,The staff is what will keep you there. You become a small family. The only downfall is you spend more time at work then with your family. Hours are often long and demanding and a days work is never done.
good,"Really enjoyed working here, I was able to utilize my abilities to their full potential and recognized for my hard work."
good,The highest quality and lowest prices of any RTO company. Great customer contact and reputation.
good,"Start with employee meeting, call all late paid customers twice, drive deleivery truck to repo or collect payments, log all activities and train other employees, open and close store."
good,"Fun place to work. Small staff. Unfortunately, the small staff means long hours away from home and family. No two days are ever the same. Some days you do need to find something to do to make the time go by faster."
good,If you enjoy working in sales and earning extra commission then this is the job for you. Even though we had goals to hit every month the district manager would hold a ring the bell contest and for every lease you typed up you won a prize.
good,It's a okay place to work at. It's just another job until you find a better paying one. Cant really make a living off the pay. They are really strict on over time.
good,"Great work place, commission based, plus paid time off and great benefits. Retail environment, which requires an individual to be available during retail hours 7 days a week"
good,"Good variety of duties daily. Never the same monotonous routine. Daily deliveries, account collections, calls, cleaning, organizing, etc. Enjoyed the steady pace, and interesting work environment."
good,"Wonderful position, was promoted after 4 months of working at this location. Training was done quickly and properly. Coworkers maintained alot of team effort."
good,Good place to work for good job experience nice opportunity just pay everyone there is friendly and all in all good place to work for. Nice place to work for
good,Met and associated with various customers through the day. Learned friendly customer service and how to assist customers with any questions asked. The management was amazing and stern. Great culture friendly people. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance the hours with school. The people were easily the most enjoyable part of the day.
good,Very busy everyday.  Learned to assemble different furniture and hook up washer and dryers and refrigerators.  Learned to drive a box truck.  Just liked being able to move around freely
good,"Aaron is known as a rental center. Such a busines at its level need to compensate employees much better. I also find security to be a major concern there, specially dealing with field collections."
good,Aarons is a good company that has good benefits and working schedule . Great people and co workers that work as a team . Flexible with home and school schedule.
good,U know I loved the people I work with but when I make overtime and I don't get payed for it becouse their are to many employees I think it is ridiculous but that's just me
good,"My experience working for Aaron's was most rewarding. Learned a lot about the business aspect of lease to own as well as back office support."
good,Learned alot working here. enjoyed the sales and the customers. Being able to place furniture in a persons home that they would enjoy felt good. And you got an hour lunch break.
good,"When I first started working here in 2016 it was a great fun place to work at however, the original manager made it difficult to excel. The new manager however was better, and energetic and engaging. The original manager no longer worked for the company after I left, but I know that the store has recently closed down."
good,I actually LOVED aarons. I learned a lot from that job. The fun you had working with each other was like working with a family. we had fun the managers were great and they were always there to help and even working with other stores was fun. That job would be a job i would love to go back too.
good,"I enjoyed working here, learning about new products and helping customers pick out products for their home. I loved our phone shops and being the best in phone sales. It was a great work environment but there was not a lot of potential for promotions."
good,"setting up the day with a meeting of managers"
good,I had a awesome time working for them . There a lot to do and everything they do is for the people and they work with people on there payment so on it
good,"Plenty of educational information during downtime.  Bonuses are great, Sundays off.  Be very clear about days you are not available.  Multiple chances for growth in the company."
good,Very friendly people. They were like family. But the hours are not ok and it is a LOT of work. You have to be a veey hard worker and you have to be very organized and upbeat.
good,The interactive training and development required for its employees is state of the art and very useful. The hours spent at work are so long it builds a strong team environment making our store goals easy to obtain. They also offer a lot of awards and incentive programs for individuals and teams to excel. Management is very supportive and support advancement. The hardest part of the job is working the 100 degree weather.
good,great company for career advancement and if u enjoy sales or deliveries would be a great career choice. been with Aarons 2 1/2 years and they have awesome benefits as a 40hr full time employee
good,"Aaron's is a great company, you get what you put in. Just follow the pathways manual and you suceed, dont follow your path, follow the pathways manual."
good,Better pay and more chances for advancement. It is honestly one of the only jobs I have worked that I was actually happy. If I had more chances in a pay increase and/or promotion I would consider staying with the company.
good,I feel like it is time for a career change to balance my work/life experience. Working in retail can take away from family.I love the competitive edge with aaron's because they allow you to create your own path to be the best.
good,I worked there four years the people are real cool we chill together we work hard and partied harder you get a  lot of preks you get bouses when you hit goals it a wonderful job
good,It is a good place to work the last atmosphere employees are easy to get along with have good equipment and on top of maintenance most of the stores have good management that will help you unload your truck
good,"If you enjoy Sales, you will definitely will have fun working at Aaron's. The system is really easy to learn and during Christmas, they have competitions within your region stores to see who sells the most. The winners receive really nice gifts as a reward, I had fun competing with my fellow colleagues."
good,"On most occasions a typical workday was hectic. There was a lot of task to complete, but at the same time you had to be customer focused. This position taught me how to effectively multitask and produce results. Interacting with the customers was usually very enjoyable."
good,It was a great opportunity and I learned a lot while working there. I had many chances to advance in the company. I got some great management experience as well.
good,"Aaron's gave me the opportunity to understand the difference between a leader and a boss. A boss just gives orders and expects things to be done and waits for a proper job to get done. Becoming a leader is hard, it takes time and patience in order to be a successful leader. When your a leader you are right there next to your people all working hard to obtain success also, encourage others if face with minor setbacks. The big difference between the two positions is where do you stand, are you behind a desk  or are you right there in the action of it all fighting to achieve a goal."
good,"This was a very intersting job, lots of furniture to be moved around tho. and so many stairs to go up and down lol. but besides that the work is really fun with the right people."
good,"Engaging with customers to find solutions on payment arrangements led me to understand why positive communication is vital to the success of business. Listening, providing positive feedback, and offering alternatives rather than losing a customer was critical. The customers appreciated the effort and care of maintaining their business through a common ground understanding."
good,Aarons is a good place to work for anyone. Regardless of where you come from or trying to get to. At Aarons based on your experience or no experience can be paid fairly. At Aarons its about team not self.
good,Work place is nice when you walk in. The workers are consistent at times and sometimes not. But it can be better and their are some wonderful people there an it can be fun at times. As long as you stay busy up there everything else is cool.
good,"Great place to work. Flexible work load, plenty to do. Loved my manager and coworkers. Management always did what he could to make the work place a better place to come too."
good,"I enjoyed working at Aarons. They were understanding when i had to take time off, they worked as teammates with the other stores in the location they only thing i had a problem with was the reason i quit.. an associate kept making inappropriate comments to me and sending me message sat odd hours of the night. i dint feel comfortable talking about it because i was the only female that worked in that store."
good,Working at Aaron's was a learning and fun experience. I learned a lot of helpful information when it comes to repairing simple issues. I worked there for 2 1/2 years and was given the opportunity to succeed in a short amount of time.
good,"You will work a lot of hour. You have built in overtime. You will rarely get a weekend off. Aarons pay good bonuses,get the most you can get when being hired. The raises are not that good."
good,go in at 7 am open up prepare meeting for all my employees. get my finance office on phones and maps ready for them to hit field at 11am. Had maps and merchandise staged for drivers to to deliveries and pick ups. I handle all closings and problems also did all ordering and remodeling of showroom weekly.
good,Once you become a manager where you go from there is limited due to size of company. Pay could be a little more competitive. The compand dies support promoting with in.
good,"Aaron's is an excellent company to work for. The culture and policies are second to none. The hours can be a but unreasonable, though. It is difficult to keep a work/life balance with their scheduling."
good,County Construction taught me a lot on how to build and pour concrete and to deal with heat and hard conditions to maintain a good natural attitude even with hard stressful times. hour were very good as well 7-3 and very good management
good,"I love this job. The only downsize is the pay. Other than that, the job is great. If you are looking at experience, you will find it here."
good,Working for Aarons for as long as I did was great. The customers reaction when they could leave the store with something they really wanted and could never afford outright was the best. It was always my pleasure to make their dreams come true.
good,Aarons is a great company to work for. They make sure to make you feel like you are family there. I would recommend my friends and family to apply for this company.
good,"Work days are pretty simple take merchandise from the showroom floor, load the truck, replace merchandise on the showroom floor, and deliver merchandise to the customer."
good,Aaron's corporate IT is great to work for.  They allow you to learn and gain a skill set that will improve your professional career.
good,"Typical day starts with getting everything ready for opening, such as powering up all electronics, cleaning and picking up store to make it look presentable. Look at the schedule for the day, get paper work and find and load merchandise for delivery. make sure everything is set up properly and working for the customers needs."
good,I loved working at Aaron`s but when our store went through three general managers in four months and they were just firing people from left to right. I knew this was not the job for people it was no longer stable.
good,"Productive , fun workplace , you meet alot of different people . fast pace , have to be able to multitask and also keep a professional demeanor at all times ."
good,Aarons was a challenging and fun place to work pay was good i enjoyed my time working for this company. gave me a lot of opportunities to further my career and knowledge
good,"we deliver furniture too customers, u ride or drive all day all over our area promoting customer service. we also go to the warehouse,unload trucks, setup displays, clean furniture when it is brought back"
good,"This is a job not for the faint of heart. If you want to have personal time, this is not it. You work a lot of hours and have no uncertainty that it will pay off. This job is physically and mentally demanding. It was fun and most that I worked with were amazing people but collections is not easy for anyone."
good,Aaron's IT department encourages seeking and learning new tools. The CIO is very active in every part of the IT group and a force in moving Aaron's ahead.
good,"Aarons is a good place to work. Fun atmosphere, good employees, great stores, good product and good staffing of the stores."
good,I've been employed with the company for a year and 2 months and i loved the fact that we worked on many different task. Made a great impression to my fellow co-workers/Supervisor but wasn't awarded for any work done.
good,I enjoyed working at Aarons. Working here has taught me how to better deal with customers. It was a fun place to work love the atmosphere and loved my fellow co workers.
good,I would come to work ready to load the trucks down with all the orders that had been placed that week.  Once done I would head out to make all deliveries.
good,"Can be rough at times with so few employees. When one person calls in, the whole store suffers. But overall, it's a good environment and everyone is friendly and gets along. Your hours can suddenly increase to much later than you were planning, though"
good,Upper management always willing to assist. Success driven company willing to invest in its associates. Hard working group with a win win attitude.
good,"The hours are sometimes long but very rewarding, Very upbeat and fast paced.  There is great communication between upper management to store level associates. Lots of learning opportunities."
good,Aaron's Inc. is a good place to start your career but job advancement can be at times limited. Everyone that works at the Buckhead location is very friendly and recommend working here.

good,"Typical day at work at arrons is like being at home with your friends and family, full of laughs to help pass the time.  Management is great and helpful to see you develop and grow.  Co-workers are amazing fun to be around and treat you like family.  Hardest part of the job was explaining features and benefits of funtiure.  Enjoyable part of the job was seeing how happy people are to get something new for their homes."
good,"Good company for hard workers.  If you put in the time and effort, you can move up quickly."
good,Enjoyed the work place vary fast pace. Co-workers and Management where vary helpful.
good,I enjoy working there everyone gets along the boss is very understanding but still supervises the right way
good,"Working at Aarons there is never a dull moment. Assisting customers, ensuring the showroom and warehouse are in top shape, and delivering merchandise in a courteous and professional manner it's always a rewarding challenge."
good,The overall experience was a good one if had the opportunity I would do it again under different management
good,Things were great until higher management wanted numbers to be higher in a tough economy then everyone was forced out for new people
good,This job was an decent job. a lot of work with little time to get anything done.
good,"Everyone is normally friendly and outgoing."
good,I was a delivery driver so I was hardly ever in the store. It was hard work but got to meet great people. I learned how to coop with people of all backgrounds.
good,"I loved this environment! It was a nice combination of customer service, management, competition and fun all rolled into one. With every sale there was always a commission factor.The coworkers were nice competition and we always worked well together to complete the tasks at hand. The hardest part of the job was collecting on very overdue accounts. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the clients and having a good time while finding them exactly what they needed."
good,"Traffic at location I was at was not as busy as I would have liked it to be but I see they moved to a better location. I learned to sell, which I had no sales experience prior to Aaron's. management and co-workers were a great group of people. Like a little family. Hardest part of the job was trying to achieve more of a traffic flow in what seemed like a ghost town at the time, but we made the best of it. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the staff I initially started with."
good,This job was fun for me to be out daily in a new place. I love driving so it was easy to do that. I also loved giving good customer service and going into people's homes being courteous and kind. That was the best part of my job.

good,"Sales. You go in, start by calling people and merchandising the store."
good,"I had to wear many hats throughout a workday. I was a salesperson, debt collector, trainer and delivery log maintainer. There was never a shortage of things to delegate or maintain on a daily basis. I learned the importance of multitasking and I loved it! I learned how to read profit and loss statements and how to run a business to grow the profit margin. My coworkers were great and we built a family environment, but i demanded respect from them. "
good,Is a hard working job never have time for family or friends. Never get off work on time always working late. 
good,In this job the employee works hard. I have learned a lot of lucrative skills from this company. My work ethic has matured a lot with this company. Management is easy going and can be strict as well when there is a deadline that is needed to be made. The co-workers are a great group of people everyone has their own work style so we have to mold to each other's way of working. The hardest part of the job is moving furniture in and off of the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with the wide variety of customers that come in our doors. Being able to help a customer and get them in the right product for the price that works best for them is rewarding!
good,Management in the store is great. Other employees are great team players. Monthly chances for bonuses. 
good,Excellent training team orientated willing to give opportunity based on performance and self motivation
good,For the pay rate the job was excellent and the hours was ok for me having small kids at home.
good,"Typical day consist of greeting customers and helping them qualify for merchandise, collections and set up and display merchandise in the store. Management was excellent and my co-workers were top notch. The hardest part of the job is in the collection dept. When you have to try and get customers to pay their bill when they don't want to. The most enjoyabe part of the job was working with the customers."
good,Been working for this franchise for over ten months. I got hired part time as a leasing specialist with promises of getting full-time employment. Aarons has a lot of potential to grow and gain more customers but advertising is where they lack.
good,Telecommunications
good,Overall it is a fun place to work at. It is not your typical retail environment.
good,"A typical day for working in my department begins at 9 a.m. and can continue until 9 p.m. I am expected to do everything from opening and closing the store to greeting the customers to answering and making contact phone calls, resolving quickly any customer issue that arises and if in fact I am unable to, it is my responsibility to get them to the right person that can. I also make home visits in an effort to gain contact with customers, as well as doing nightly deposits and taking the deposits to the bank. In my time employed with Aarons, I have learned a great deal about resolving customer conflicts, how to appropriately use any tools provided by this company to assist customers to ownership of their leased merchandise, as well as applying and effectively remaining within the policies of the Fair Debt Collection Act."
good,"When I would come into work the first thing I would do would be to walk around the store and make notes to everything that needed to be done. Then, I would make a list for all employees that needed to be completed. Next, I would take the deposit to the bank. After that I would return to the store and make sure that all the merchandise and paperwork was together and in the warehouse ready to load up and deliveried to customers. Finally, I would go and unlock the front door and get ready for the customers."
good,"Working with Aarons, Inc. has been a very valuable experience and I can highly recommend the company for anyone willing to work in a competitive industry where the rewards are worth the effort."
good,Coworkers made each day new and exciting although there was always much work to do. This company constantly gave to the community by volunteering for activities and donating. Truely amazing company!
good,"I worked for aarons/ Home smart for a while and the best i can say is i did the hardest job for the lowest pay. A typical work day for me was doing truck inspections, making routes, then carrying merchandise between 3pounds to 300 pounds solo 95% of the time, then working late while your store manager went home. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the over tasking of a single employee and doing the work of 2 employees. The most enjoyable i drove a large truck and when you had a partner in the truck it was always a blast. Not all management is bad in Aarons/Homesmart Only the one in Portsmouth is that horrible chewing people out due to over time and when you refuse over time getting your job threatened."
good,"Typical day at work, I would file paperwork, process and input customers information, follow up with customers and offer them good deals on merchandise in the store. I would also send out letters in the mail trying to get old customers back. I learned a lot working here as a customer service representative. I loved taking care of the customer and making sure they were always satisfied with what they got. Part of my job was to sell, and to try and sell what we had in the store, but most of the time people wanted to order new merchandise which was hard for me to say no because I always want to make my customer happy. I had an awesome boss who worked well with me and my schedule, which I loved! He treated everyone with respect. We al got along real well and worked great as a team."
good,"It was a great place to work when I first started. When we started getting away from the original standards and cultures the founder had in place it went downhill fast. I loved working there until my store was transfered to a different region. After that it was hard to maintain a high level of motivation. My staff was short and was put down on a daily basis by the new regiona, it made them unhappy at work, which translated into poor performance and eventually quiting. I was never allowed to advance beyond store manager, even though my performance warranted it. I was always in the top 40 of the ranking sheets and yet never had even an interview to advance. Then when my father passed away they all but abandond me. They gave my store to soemone else and offered me a store with 4 hours more drive time and still expected me to work 12-14 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week. The store they offered had a horrible performance record and would have resulted in a $22k pay cut. It would be like starting all over. I had taken the store in McAlester and turned it from a store that consistantly loss money every month to a top performing store. My team and I finished top ten All Star Store of the year in 2008. We also had numerous other awards to prove that we were winners. This company is not about what you have done and can do in the future, it is what have you done today store. They never took into account that beating your employees down was not the best motivator. Although I miss working there I am relieved that I have an opportunity to start a new chapter in my career, witha company that"
good,"My time so far working with Aaron's has been very much so enjoyable. Their hiring process is such that they hire only those competent enough to do what is required of them with minimal supervision and prompting after the initial training phase. Day to day operations run smoothly most of the time, though our delivery schedule can become somewhat packed up and skewed with promises that cannot necessarily be kept. The hours are fair, but leave little room for an active family life. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with the company and have had no major qualms with this career, other than have a skewed work/home life balance. All in all, a great company to work for if you can stick out the slow start and can manage a lower pay scale for a few years, but this start is not ideal for those who have children and families to provide for."
good,a typical work day at this company was good everyone was smiling mostly i work as the delivery guy so had allot of lifting and driving and paperwork. the coworkers always brightened up the day nomatter what.the most enjoyable part of work was working with good people and working as a team.

good,Solid company to work for as it allows opportunities for personal and professional growth. Their Learning and Development as pertains to the job is excellent.
good,"I loved my days at Aarons. There is to much to say. the ONLY reason I left was due to pay scale. I maxed out in 2016 at $12.00 per hour as a Sales Manager. Otherwise, it was a fun job."
good,I felt like this company was teaching me a lot I loved the people I was working with they was great I loved coming to work just to see them again I loved staying at work late to help out

good,I really liked Aaron’s. I should have never quit but I was working for a franchise. Same policy and goals. I would like to work there again one day maybe.
good,I enjoyed my experience there and would do it again I've really had a great learning experience. I learned so much that I took those lessons with me in my future adventures.
good,"Good company to work for, Develops good changes to meet current & future demands & opportunities"

good,Good work environment can be very slow sometime but nothing to serious a good place for someone looking to get into sales can start since the process is very easy to learn
good,As a retail sales associate my tasks mainly revolved around the tasks dealing with customers and the merchandise. There were times I would sort files but that was about it.
good,Everyday was a new adventure loved the diversified work load it was never boring great sales training and never just stuck in the store would recommend working here great career starter.
good,"Aarons had a great environment, great sales goals, and a good team. "
good,"Wish I could go back. Loved working there and my customer miss me also.. great with my time and days loved the discount and my boss an......,.........."
good,The company had decent benefits and retirement program. The opportunity for advancement was there if you wanted it. They offered plenty of resources and training to help you advance your career. The life/work ration was more than reasonable as long as you had good organizational skills. The only negative about the company is the compensation. The pay rates need to be higher for the management positions
good,"I love my job because I love to help people ."
good,"Great management team, hard workers who get orders out in a timely manner, also the shipping and receiving team is full of hard workers and great work ethic"

good,"A typical day in Sales at Aaron's consists of answering phones all day, and assisting customers with account management, payments, and adding on sales, either by phone or in the store.  Most days will also require some marketing efforts, such as cold calls, prepping flyers, or field marketing."
good,Aaron’s was a good company to work for!  I enjoyed my experience as an CAA! The management treated customers fairly.  The customers can first in every possible aspect.
good,Up and down fast paced company but they do give a family type of atmosphere to work with. Managers and company in general are very helpful and willing to assit.
good,"most of the day is spent dealing with debt collection via phone or in person at the customers house. customers obviously do not like that so you typically get yelled at quite a bit. other responsibilities include managing the drivers and helping them set up the deliveries and/or returns/services/moves or whatever other stops they have for the day. of course taking payments and helping sales staff with customers is a must. when short staffed you do go on the truck and help with deliveries. everyone works together as a team and helps each other out. having co workers who arent afraid to work really makes the difference.benefits are excellent. medical, dental, vision, plus life insurance, 401k, and more. 3 weeks vacation, 10 sick days if needed."
good,Aaron's put customer first.  Maintained the cleanest and best quality products.  Enjoyed meeting customers whether in store or in home.  Had fun time working.
good,"You help customers with payments, sales, delivery of their product and help customer with any questions. The long hours and being out in delivery truck alone was hardest. Co workers were great. I loved meeting new people and getting to know your customers personally."

good,"A typical day at work would include numerous different tasks, either scheduled or not scheduled, to be worked on or completed. A small group of base employees meant that everyone had a role to play in the progress of day to day operations. I was able to learn most areas of operations within the business and opportunities to practice my skills daily."
good,Help the customer out with picking and choosing there iteams take the monthly payments pick up the phones restore electronic set up the floor with merchandise clean the lobby
good,I worked with great staff and customers. Everyday was exciting and new.... not a lot of pressure to do anything. we were encouraged to have fun with the customers as we worked and we built a family relationship with them.
good,"I like my leadership team they are smart and effective in their positions."
good,"I loved my job.  The worst part was being a ""repo"" person.  It broke my heart to have to take back things from people that were trying hard to own things."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you have a good manager. Hard work some time long hours working in the rain or heat. Decent pay, good benefits and vacation time."
good,"On a daily basis we would deliver appliances, furniture, TVs.  Everyone was good to work with, some days would be tiring and long. It was a good job, Saturdays would be long at times."
good,Productive and very relaxed work space amazing management and very nice fellow co workers I was paid very good and also had amazing benefits the hours were great as well
good,"Working at Aarons has you interacting with customers and employees on a daily basis. The customers and employees can be friendly. While working, you assist with the delivery of products and services."
good,Give more team building and management training. I think if a change is made give it enough time to see how it works out. Think the GM of the store should have authority to choose a local vendor to do maintenance on product because some that they use now I feel they just be bill stacking.
good,"Good place to work at , if there's good management. "
good,Great insurance plan. Off Sundays and some of the main holidays. I'll recommend this place for someone who wants to grow professionally in sales and marketing.
good,"incoming and outgoing calls, not stressful, great commission, Director is  very understanding. the sales manager was very honest and truly cares he wanted to make sure you were comfortable in supporting your family and enjoying life. always wanted to make sure you did better each year"
good,I come to work from 10:15am  to 9:15pm everyday. First thing I do Is make my first round of phone calls to touch base with the customers about their accounts and when they would be able to make it in. After that I will do online training classes or go to the backroom and clean. From then on if one of are drivers is off for the day I will go on the truck with them and help them with their delivery's. Every Monday will will do a inventory count so  we know what merchandise is in the store and what has went out of the store. I will then end the night running accounts in the company truck.
good,theres never a dull day days full of surpises you stay on the move witch makes the day go by. plus we have go good crew . I just wish for better hours
good,Good Place to start out in moving furniture and appliances if you have never done it before. Your off every Sunday which is a plus. Easy to get bonuses.
good,"I enjoy working for Aaron's. The only down fall is the hours, as well as the advancement in career. I don't see it as a career, just a job to get me by. They pay you pretty well. The team I work for is awesome. It always feel like a team, and not like I am doing everything on my own. Non-hostile environment."
good,I enjoyed my time at Aaron's. The company is progressive. It is a challenging place to work with rewards for top performers. Time doesn't stand still. There is always customers to take care of.

good,fun plase to work you get to meet lots of new people the managet is alway working hard  to do what need to be do so you got to keep up the hardest part would be make sure  you get to all your stops  because some stops want alot done or tge get alot of things and that can be very  time consuming
good,Working at Aaron's was very stressful at times. The worse is driving in all weather conditions and company not caring about the condition of the truck.
good,Good place to work but you really have to watch your customer base.  With todays economy it is hard to collect on accounts and can be hostel at times with customers but overall a good experience.
good,This was my first full-time job and I loved every second of it. If it was paying what I needed at this time in my life I would work there again right now.
good,"It’s overall a nice place to work depending on you. I don’t like the long hours , I barely be with my family and when I do it’s at night time. I pretty much didn’t like my pay and the customers that run every time they seen us coming. A lot of phone calls are being made throughout the day basically trying to get payments or the merchandise back. The bonus are awesome."
good,There were many opportunities for career advancement within the company. Hard work was always recognized in the organization and helped to excel your role
good,"was very fast paced, keeps u busy and everyday is not the same. you gain valuable social skills. My advice to any new employee is that you must keep a positive attitude."
good,"Aarons is very competitive work environment that requires customer interaction on  daily basis. Collections, payment, deliveries, and maintaining adequate staffing levels keeps the pace of the job very busy, and the hours long."
good,"Aaron's has taught me a lot about sales and really get their people trained on the products sold and how they relate to the consumer. "

good,I learned management skills and grew relationships w my co-workers have been able to have a little freedom in my position. Ive learned the business of lease to own
good,"A typical day consists of greeting customers, receiving payments both in person and over the phone, collection calls, marketing calls, outside door to door marketing and display set up.  Aarons has an extension training program so everyone know the same information and is on the sam page when dealing with customers.  My manger is great.  They seem to care about their employees and it shows. I enjoy meeting new people from all walks of life."
good,"It was a good job. I learned sold, help the client"
good,"Hard work but a good job if you are looking for stability. Upward mobility as well as a good training program. I highly recommend this job as a great ""first"" job."
good,Positive work place. Needs better pay. Good benefits. Good manager and co-workers. Dot Certification. Competitive pay options. Would recommend to friend.
good,"I started out as an assistant manager, quickly advanced to my own store. The pay is great. The regional manager at the time was rude and self serving which is uncalled for in a team environment."
good,"The pay wasn't the best as a sales associate dealing with heavy product and set-ups for rooms in the house. Management made up for that, great sales team. Location was great so they were consistent with customer foot traffic in the store with plenty of loyal customers that would pay in full or be consistent with payments."
good,i enjoy the hard work i did at Aarons it was a good work envioment and to see the customer face when they are receive there merchandise and the good old smiles on the face

good,"I loved working for the company,  very family like atmosphere and very long hours. I'm a workaholic so that worked for me."
good,"The work was fun, the balance between social life and work was slim. Management was awesome, the hardest part of the job is taking lunches so early and then no more breaks the rest of the day."
good,was a great place to work for the summer got to spend alot of time outside my duties were to spray off cars and count the money down at night and close store was very fun job
good,Great environment. Great people. Pay is the only problem that I have with the company. Benefits are good. Easy going work place. Great customers makes the day go by.
good,"entertaining, fast paced, joyful enviroment. overall a good place to work and gives u a chance to move up in the company."
good,It was a okay job  the pay sucked.People was good to work with .I liked working there but not lifting all that heavy furniture. They did take good care of their employees.
good,"Honest and great company to work for."
good,"Never should have left, thought I had something better. I feel the work the people do on the truck is worth more hen the compensation. Still a good company to work for."
good,Great benefits with hands on training with computer work and in store training Friendly environment 40 hours with hard working staff to meet the needs of are customers.
good,I would go in turn on computer and lights an clean show room make sure sale prices were right. Then start with my daily filing and calling. Then when customers walked in greet and make sales or payments.
good,"Was a great place to work but I got injured (not on the job) and they ""fired"" me told me i would be the first man up if a position was open but now wont hire me because I date someone there. Dont think thats a good reason not to hire someone back. Someone who did what ever that was asked of him to do."
good,"Aaron's was a really good place to start a career. Okay environment and very good compensation, but this all varies on the individual. Great coworkers."
good,"Overall, a pretty good place to work, it is a warehouse job that involves furniture and kitchen appliances so it is a heavy duty lifting job.  There are usually always opportunities to learn how to operate new equipment.  In the 3 and 1/2 years there I have learned to operate most types of warehouse clamps and lifts."
good,"Following policy, start at 8 a.m. Daily goals communicated, route mapped out, easily explained and achievable. Great skill to learn and great people to meet. Depending on your manager, your day will go smoothly. Hardest part of the job is collections, trying to remove unpaid merchandise from disgruntle customers, but if all goes too far the authorities are called and handled from there."
good,Assisted in all aspect to provide Customer Satisfaction. Repossessions of Equipment from customers who failed to comply with consumer contracts & Delivery of Equipment for new and existing Clients.
good,Pleasant company to be a part of. Work life balance is good and people are good to work with. Would recommend corporate to my network.
good,"I enjoyed this job, the benefits were okay, but the advancement opportunities need work, I was there for almost 2 years and didn't move up."
good,Can be a good place to work with unlimited income potential but they do work a ton of hours. Would be really great place to work if the days were not so long
good,This was my first job ever. The management was amazing and they really worked around my school schedule. The company was going through some adjustments and it got a little messy and confusing towards the end of my time there. The new management was highly disliked.
good,"I've enjoyed my first 6 months here at Aaron's. One of the reasons I decided to make a change in my career was to have balance between work and home life. Hey at the end of the day we're all searching for that type of career while making good money in the process. Throughout the course of the work day your constantly learning and redefining how to present yourself to your clientele. Whether its managing customer accounts, selling or delivering merchandise it's a constant evolution of yourself. The managers and staff members I've encountered have all been very eager to teach, coach and offer assistance at anytime. I've never been one to say something is hard but I do have the opportunity to get better at it. So for me this has been a really an exciting work experience so far."
good,Day at work consists of making sure the customers get their merchandise on time and the day that they were supposed to get it. Making sure that they are happy with the delivery and merchandise
good,I liked this job for the most part other than the competition for sales. I liked helping my customers find the products that they were looking for. Management was always great to work for.
good,Loved the company but leadership was a little over bearing. I would suggest the company to others for a job. It's my hope they start valuing the workers more.
good,"A typical day Aarons consists of first having a strategy meeting with the two other managers which consists of coming up with what goals we want to achieve and how we are going to go at achieving them. Then, we lay out what we need our employees to accomplish for that day."
good,"It was a good place to work.  You get there in the morning, load everything up, and drive around all day.  Getting to meet with the customers at there house made my customer service skills improve."
good,"Working for a company that was big on customer service and always making customers smile. This company is known to serve a good cause for foundations, always supporting the community."
good,"My overall experience was great at Aaron Services, helping the public with heating and plumbing in their homes.Working on my own initiate and a team with daily challenges."
good,"Just a 9 hour day, working with the best crew and management, dealing with customer issues, loading up the drivers for deliveries, cleaning and maintaining the warehouse and store room.  The hardest part of the job is that I can't get to everyone's concerns in one day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my crew because they became my family."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The customers and the associates made it a very exciting work place. Each day added something new. Also I liked the fact that at times I was able to travel to other store to work.
good,"Make calls to customers for payments on their rented merchandise. Also try to sell merchandise to new customers."
good,I go to work at about 6:30. Sometimes I stay to 9:00. I get some paperwork finished when I arrive. I start to make collection phone calls. I may gone on the road with some of the drivers to make pickups or deliveries. Then I close the store at the end of the day.
good,Working at Aarons was very interesting. Everyday I went in knowing it was going to be a very busy day. Management was good to their  employees. Employees helped each other . The hardest part of the job was all the heavy lifting that I would do.
good,Aaron's is a friendly company that like their employees to advance. This company always made sure they were promoting within and made sure you were taking classes.
good,Aaron's Inc. was a great place to work. The down side was job & home balance with teens in the house. The management was very nice and great to work with.

good,Great job with a great atmosphere. Long hours if you have a family.
good,good place to learn how the leasing and sales side of buying furniture and appliances
good,"good fun work environment, I learned manager skills and how to handle all manager responsibilities."
good,"The environment and co workers make it a great place to be, I've learned many things from this job to advance my career."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting the day planned and organized, setting your team a goal to accomplish and getting things done. Selling product to new and current customers, as well as collecting payments on existing customers. "
good,love meeting new people and unloading trucks and driving to the different locations and helping out customers
good,"At Aaron's you work from open to close, come in dressed ready to work.  Get the delivey driver information for the day, talk with the management and hit the road with the assignment for the day.  The hardest part of the job was collecting the property from customer who refuse to pay for the equipment.  The most fun I have ever had came from a customer who just loves how everthing was from start to finish, they recommended new customers just cause, it was awesome for business."
good,"One of my best work experience! Great enviroment, I learned a lot of how to run a business and work with many people. I learned how to manage expences,budget control,inventory control and the logistic part of the business. The hardest part of the job was lifting and loading trailers. The best part of the job, everyday was a diferent day!."
good,"It was a fun job with challenges and I wished I would've stayed there,"
good,"Good benefits and a good computer base learning program, make sure you get a manager that could possible come out of the office sometimes though."
good,"good and fun place to work and also good learning environment..."
good,There was times it could be fun and to cut up but also it was good work cause it gave you a work out as well as it had its ups and downs to
good,"very good company to work for. the upper management cares for their employees, I received a call from the owner of the company on my second day of work, welcoming me to his team."
good,Couldnt handle driving 30 miles everyday but it was a great work enviroment
good,Aaron's is a excellent company with a great deal of highly talented individuals.  Moving in the right direction.
good,"good people fun days always something going on"
good,"Aaron's overall was a good experience, it taught me a lot about how to make people feel comfortable while they shop, as well as learning how to get pass the just looking response that most customers give."
good,"I didn't like the type of work, just wasn't for me. a lot of people that came in are rude."
good,A typical day at Aaron's consist of delivering product to customers homes. Setting up merchandise and demonstrating the product to them.
good,"collect on past due accounts, open new accounts, review loan applications, provide training for employees"
good,"A typical day at work for Aaron's for me would be going over the order log for customers who had scheduled delivers for that day then organizing the fastest routes and and placing the route stops in the most organized order to fit the schedule. I would then go into the warehouse to assemble new items and furniture, place them out on the floor and managed where the overflow in the stockroom went. I obtained knowledge on in-field customer service when another employee and myself would go out to collect returned/unpaid items from customers. The management team were all hands-on people who had no problem helping me out when I needed it and also never failed to give me an assignment list for my day. My co-workers were all easy to get along with, and when the time came for advancement into the customer service portion of the store for me, my co-workers still showed me the utmost level of respect. The hardest part of the job for me at first would be balancing out training new members in the back for proper store room storage and assembly, and making sure my routes were drawn up as well, but in the end it all become a steady flow for me, which got me a lot of appraisal for my hard work ethic and dedication. I think the most enjoyable part would be the ability to take the online on-site classes in the store on the terminals to advance myself in the Aaron's work place.  "
good,"I learned a lot from my 5 1/2yrs at Aarons. My co-workers were always great, management was always helpful and to the point. the hardest part was to loose some my favorite co-workers, the most enjoyable was meeting a lot of new people"
good,I like being able to be out in the truck all day delivering furniture because it made the day go by fast. The pay could be better tho.
good,"speaking with customers on a daily basis, Manager was very good, my co-workers were really good, enjoyed dealing with the public"
good,typical day was trying to settle delinquent accounts with customers. delivering and setting up merchandise purchased. hardest part of the job was delivering merchandise 2-3 flights of stairs.
good,come in the morning turn on all apliances
good,Great place to work; a wonderful Atlanta based business.
good,"The job wasn't all that bad except the constant going. Me and my helper would have to drive most of the day, and deliver furniture to people multiple residents throughout the day. We would also have to pick up furniture from customers who would not pay their bills. Could be very frustrating, but it taught me a lot about patience."
good,Aarons is an awesome Company. I have learned alot in a short period of time. My customer service skills has grown tremendously since being with the company. Its a fast yet steady work environment. Only disadvantage is there is no stabilty and no room for advancement.
good,"Every morning you have no idea what you are going to do. In this business there may be a plan but it can never be stuck to. If you are a manager, the best advice I can give you is, when you promise something stick to it, and be consistent with the way you treat customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers, the most enjoyable part is getting out and dealing with customers in the field."
good,A typical day starts out with getting each of the days deliveries in order. then loading up the truck for delivery.
good,"Aaron's is a good opportunity w great benefits. As a manager you are required to work longer hours than a normal job for management you will be required to work 45-50 hours per week, Starting pay is good for the positions and not alot of jobs still pay weekly so that is a plus. You just have to be willing to commit yourself to long hours and challenging work"
good,"There are to sides to Aaron's,  corporate  store and a franchise  store. I have personally worked both sides and one is by the  book 100% and the other has as a little wiggle room. Its a great place to work and advance  if you are willing to work hard and smart and be willing to relocate  when the time comes, in short you get out of it what u put into in.. big shout out to everyone at F1304 former co949 . U rock"
good,I really enjoyed my time in Aarons. While I was there I met a lot of great people to help me get going in the right direction that I needed to be on in my life
good,"Aarons is a great company with goals to be follow for success. Work 50 and life balance no so great, its a lot of hours of work and unless you work 45 to 50 the money is very low for the amount of work done,"
good,I enjoyed working with this company. Advancement is most certainly possible and encouraged. The best part of the job is forming relationships with your customers.
good,This job was full of passion excitement and meeting new accomplishments and rewards benefits package was great customers were great. I would definitely return to this job at any level.
good,Working here can be mentally strenuous but the benefits and job atmosphere is worth it. The overhead is low so chemistry with co-workers is pivitol. Having a good manager means everything. If you have the opportunity to become employed here I'd highly recommend you take the chance!
good,"A typical day at errands for me will be loading and unloading delivery and freight trucks. I assemble customers products at their homes,  as well instruct the customers how to use and work the product properly.my management team was very awesome we all worked at it seem to get a good jobs done no matter what. Our workplaces was warm welcoming friendly environment to any coachracing culture culture"
good,I spent 6 years working for Aarons and I was let go because of performance I feel like I should have had a longer time and a little more pay because of the size of the store I worked at but it was a very good learning experience
good,The work place was fun depending on who you worked with. This was a sales position and being in the store in the worse area we never made many sales but of course this always fell back on us. Everyone was nice until the RM came. The pay was too little for the amount of task they wanted us to perform but we did get lots of benefits.
good,They put a lot of responsibility on the GM they should empower other members of management and hold them more accountable for standards and goals!!!!!
good,its like we dont have a life outside of aarons we work 45 hours a week no time for family. I work so much when i get off i shower and straight to bed. Aarons now opens on Sunday is a bit to much for the workers.
good,"Aaron’s has many opportunities for advancement because they operate both traditional brick and mortar stores and have another company, Progressive, which focuses on online RTO transactions with other retailers."
good,"Small staff so everyone usually gets along really well.  Plenty of hours, I always get OT.  Pay is decent, the sales incentice percentages are a little low though.  you have to sell A LOT to a little."
good,i load and unload merchandise to deliver. some days are tougher than others. i have to handle with care with customers homes as well as their newly purchased product.
good,"Looking for another job because company made changes from full time to part time and not enough to pay bills"
good,Company has began to scale back on a lot of perks and benefits. The work culture is a great atmosphere to be in. You can move up easily if you take your job serious..
good,"Very good atmosphere to work in.  Good management,  safe working conditions,  flexible work hours, good training, fun atmosphere.  Nice building,  good company benefits"
good,"Load Appliances, How to put together certain furniture, and sales experience, laid back but hard working when help is needed, sales and delivering, Field Visits for people who refuse to pay, The employees"
good,"This was such a fun job, you worked hard, and sometimes it was emotionally taxing but this is the place to work. The team effort was amazing, the culture from other stores right down to yours was wonderful, and the management couldn't be better. The only reason I do not work there anymore is because I had little work/life balance as the hours can be taxing as well."
good,my personal experience and opinion with the company is positive. I was able to learn great communication skills with coworkers and customers in the short time I was with the store. my workplace was positive and supportive with a family like environment.
good,"Schedule is fair and you earn paid time off after a year. Turn around is very high for part technicians and the customers are shady. Management has a ""get er done any way possible"" attitude which is not always the best approach. Dont always approve of the methods and the tricks they pull."
good,Though the hours in the account dept can be long and take away from family sometimes the pay is good and I liked the people I worked with. Training is good too. corporate is all about their employees
good,Its a great place to work. They help people to own furniture and appliances when they don't have credit. It also helps to build your credit. Its a company I am very proud to work for and hope they continue to grow.
good,"My previous manager was great with working with my home schedule to make sure I was always able to take my 1 year old daughter to all her doctor appointments. If for some reason I had to leave to take care of her, he never complained and allowed me to put my family first."
good,"We work in teams one staging for the truck to load while the other fills holes on stage floor, I learned how to reprogram t,v.s and attach cords to dryers. the GM she's an amazing friendly person I had three co-workers all of which are amazing and love to joke when it's ok to ,hardest part was working with the w-29 couches most enjoyable was the hr lunches with great people."
good,"great place to work for if you're money motivated. lots of room for advancement and bonuses when quotas are met. however for some people the job can be slightly taxing. It's great feeling like santa clause selling and delivering product, but sucks telling those same people that you're going to have to pick up those items if they dont pay their bills.."
good,"Great job, Great pay. Long hours, but paid well. As with any job, management make or breaks it........................................................"
good,"Organized day, new lists every week that included cleaning, phone calls, sales calls, delivery schedule. Many learning experiences with communication skills. busy management, friendly co-workers. Dealing with angry customers was a struggle. making people happy everyday was the most enjoyable."
good,"Good, honest, full time work. Dealing with customers daily with large range of personalities and backgrounds. Stores keep small staff so everyone has to do more, but allows you to get closer to your coworkers and be more like a family."
good,I only have great things tp say about the company. I was looking for an opportunity to learn more so that I could expand my career and I did.
good,"This a great company to work for, I learned the fundementals of sales, collections, and most of all people. The money was good but the hours could be long depending on the staffing you have."
good,first the goal board for the day needs to filled out. next is the strategy meeting for the days goals. Get someone on the road to field visits delinquent account holders. The co-workers were awesome with everyone pitching in on their part of the team goals. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get in touch with people who've moved away with our merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was hitting goals and earning bonuses.
good,Good atmosphere and co-workers got along. Management made sure that all workers were treated equally. The hardest part of the job was working over 13 hours a day at least 3 or 4 times a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was all departments in the store were great team players and gained customer satisfaction.
good,"Never a boring moment. This job was fun, challenging and rewarding. If you ar the type that isn't ok with doing one thing all day this career is for you."
good,"Aaron's is a great company to work for. There is endless opportunity and great benefits. You get paid for what you do. Work hard, and you'll make good money. Sales and accounts each have there benefits and downsides. For sales, the selling aspect is nothing. It's all of the work involved with merchandising, delivering, inventory, etc. Accounts are tough because you're trying to hold customers accountable to pay their renewal. Either position provides a lot of experience valuable to any career."
good,"I have been with this company for 3 years now and have had my ups and downs just like many with this company.  The flexibility with home life and understanding that you are human is fantastic in my experience. The small family-like work environment makes you feel like you can be yourself. No looking over your shoulder. Benefits, paid days, and paid holidays are some of the best I have seen. The Advancement and encouragement is empty. I work in a small store 2 hours away from the City where our ""home office"" is. We are a small customer based store in an country town where no one wants to move to. Yet 3 people in this store alone, including myself, have been lied to on ""being the next best thing"" or saying they will get the double income promotion to General Manager. Even the GM at the current time has been lied to and tossed around.  I have been through 5 General Managers in this company and it has proven to me that the apprenticeship in this company is a joke and they do not have faith in their own training abilities. They would rather bring in outside experience instead of promote within their own stores."
good,"I love the team I work with at my location. It is really like a big family, and although we have had a lot of turnover, it has always maintained the close knit feel. However I have heard horror stories about working with GMs that are overbearing. The company itself is an excellent company to work for, especially if you are a college grad. given the right management you stand to learn a lot about the industry as a whole. The work life balance sucks, as the rental industry is a get it while you can business. meaning you have to be open and available to get the business that is coming in. That translates to long days delivering merchandise, collecting money and generating new sales. the compensation package, while not ideal, has the potential to be lucrative...depending on your location. If you are selling and collecting, you will make more money, if you aren't, then you won't. the benefits are good, they have a lot of options to choose from as far as health, dental, disability, flexplans etc. There is job security, there is a lot of work to do, so short of stealing or not showing up, you have a very low chance of being let go at the store level. My division as a whole has great management, from the bottom to the top. Inside my store as a manager trainee I learned a lot from my sales, account, and general managers. The regional managers are very visible as they are in each store at least once every two weeks. They are available to answer any questions and they also put in as much time and work as anyone else in the store. The Aarons culture is a good one. They promote a lot from"
good,"As the CSR, I did quite a bit there. From sales, to fixing furniture, collections, deliveries, and also dealing with the show room itself. The management was OK, though there were times we didn't see eye to eye. My co-workers were OK, though they kept to themselves a lot. The hardest part of working there was it didn't Leave me much time to do a lot outside of work, like going back to school. the most enjoyable part were my customers and also my paycheck and benifits."
good,"Start day with a strategy meeting, make round of calls, 40 calls per hour, and get solid commitments. After meeting walk showroom floor to see what merch needs to be stage, and check all service calls, take deposit to the bank, market about two to three business. Check with csr, mt, pt's and gm to be sure everybody is on the same page."
good,It is a great place to work and I enjoy what I do. My boss is insightful and I enjoy working for him.
good,"A top notch company understood because of its size, its workforce, and more importantly its profits."
good,good place to work if you can deal with the hours sucks if you get sold to a franchise that's the only reason I left
good,"Great place to work and definitely enjoyed my tenure.  I had a great manager that was willing to teach me everything that she knew and I of course absorbed it like a sponge."
good,"Usually the day starts off, with staging merchandise to get delivered and doing a route sheet and truck inspection . Load up the merchandise to be delivered by the scheduled time. Its a pretty laid back job. Hours are usually 10 am to 7 pm for product techs. The best part about this job is the driving and seeing customers having the dreams delivered to them."
good,Aaron's is a great company to work for only if you have no life.
good,"A typical day at work included answering phones, sealing envelopes, maintaining cleanliness in the store, and filing. Also, co-workers were helpful and friendly, as the manager. This was an easy job, its too bad I was only able to work here for the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to come to work at 10am, which isn't that early and 10am is the time the store opens, as well as being able to show and explain various products too customers."
good,Great place to make money if you're willing to sale and aim for those incentive goals.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was a good learning experience and challenge every day. Mangagment work with employees in every way to make the company a better place. The hardest part of the job for me was having time for my kids but everything I did at this company was enjoyable and fun for me.
good,"As a PT (Product Technician), your # 1 rule is safety first. You have values and goals you set and the company lives by. You go out delivering to customers, and they expect new/like-new merchandise being delivered to their homes, and with that comes safety as well as a sense of responsibility."
good,"really good managment. learn great products, and everyone that I worked with was really wonderful."
good,This job for me was very fun. I was always able to see how well my store was preforming and I could watch as my numbers got better and better everyday. It was a great place to refine skills with instant feedback.
good,I enjoy working here just wish it paid more or at least be competitive with similar jobs. I learned alot here and my co-workers are really nice people
good,"This company acknowledges all hard work and will give you a raise with out you even asking. Sales is a little intense at times, but all the meetings and coaching helps. Nice, comfortable environment. Every Aarons I've been too all the employees are knowledgeable and always willing to help another succeed."
good,This was the best place to start as a manager. The staff for the most part was very helpful. I learned how to be more steadfast in my decisions. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping design their homes.
good,The work flow was great along with coworkers. Felt there could have been better communication between departments. The work environment was so great I had fun with what I did which made me passionate about my career
good,A great and caring company to work for. Of course there are bad days but every job has those. Overall would definitely work there again in the future.
good,"If you enjoy sales, and marketing.. This is a great company to work for. "
good,"Great place to work, it can get hard at times but overall it’s good, the management is very nice and informative and training was easy to pick up. So far I really enjoy the job"
good,"First thing I do when I get to work is look at the daily log of scheduled stops for the day, they're assorted by morning stops and evening stops. We load our morning stops first based on the location of each stop. (first stop gets loaded last and vice versa) We then head to our first stop and so on until the morning stops are done. We get an hour lunch in between morning and evening stops. I've learned a lot so far working their from how to properly lift and maneuver furniture and appliances to get them safely and undamaged into the customers house, from how to better work directly with customers and drive a box truck very well. My bosses are great and take their time to make sure that myself along with everyone else in the store is doing what they're supposed to be doing as safe and efficiently as possible. All of my coworkers are easy going and friendly. The hardest part of the job would be the occasional delivery or return of a full bedroom or living room set to the top of a three story apartment complex. I most enjoy my coworkers and how easy going my bosses make what would normally be a very stressful situation be."
good,"DAILY TASKS"
good,Working at Aarons was definitely different but in good ways.  The store team was small which allowed for real collaboration.  I learned a lot about an industry I knew very little about
good,I would come in run credit cards assigned for that day; conduct team strategy plan for the day; make calls to those that have not paid on their accounts and conduct home visits to discuss accounts or return merchandise
good,Aarons really was extremely challenging and as a GM you have total control.  Aarons provided excellent training and actually trained general managers to learn from there mistakes. This provided a great working relationship.
good,Fast paced work environment. Rapid changes that are rolled out at times with out thought at what affect it might have on the store or how the store might be able to handle it with the small foot prints available to them. Upper management very supportive in trying to help to implement rollout if possible.
good,"Great place to work. Good work environment. Management was fair and communicated well with our employees. "
good,"Home Furniture sold on lease. Make sales all day, take payments, phone calls, marketing, a lot of socializing . Easy work place & real smooth. Customers can be rude at times with misunderstanding agreements payments . Sometimes overwhelming with sales, payments & phone calls. Satisfaction of coustomer satisfaction & new customers also  sale revenue increased for bonus."
good,"Friendly Co-workers"
good,"my job as a csr was pretty basic. You come in at 9:30 or 10am and open, turn on tvs, computers and radio systems. You answer phone calls and answer customers questions or direct them to the right work station. You have to process and file folders. The main part is reaching your goals for sales and following the key points to selling."
good,"A typical day at work requires getting dirty."
good,Working for Aaron's is very rewarding. I have learned patience working with our customers and I enjoy working with the public. Aaron's really cares about there employees and we are all taken care of and it is appreciated. My co-workers are hard workers and we all try to help each other when needed. The communication between management and employees is very good.
good,"Great team work. Manager always pushing and motivating us. I learned more on how to help cutomers onto a more personal view. The hardest part was staying the long hours, but at the end it was worth it."
good,"Start the day by creating a welcome environment. Check over the service log and check in with what needs attention that morning and get it on the morning route or send to a service provider. Do a daily list of duties to be done during the day for the employees.  Answer phones and take payment as well as sales.  Refill any furniture holes on the sales floor that has been sold and removed.  I work along side of my co-workers to maintain any problems that occur during the day."
good,"My experience there was productive, energetic and the work is always consistent. It was a very pleasant work environment. My co-workers is the best to be around, always striving for more. I can only say the only hard part about that job was seeing my manager's face when we couldn't achieve our quota. As for the best part of the day was knowing we can achieve these standards that corporate set for us as a team."
good,"A typical is between 9 am until 9 pm. "
good,Days can be very long depending on the work load for the day. You get to meet a lot of people and interact them on a daily basis. It is a job that allows you to use your hands as well as people skills. It does require a strong body as you are lifting large appliances and furniture in and out of a truck. You spend most of your time out on the truck doing deliveries and service calls.
good,"Warehouse Mang."
good,"If the store you're working for is Franchised there isn't much room for advancement, but if it's corporate then you have the ability to transfer and move up with the company. Paid weekly is a great tool to keep everyone happy, and the bonus structure in place is great, knowing you have the ability to make upwards to $600 in bounus is a great incentive for everyone and makes you strive for more."
good,"This was a fun job to restore company procedures by maintaining quality services of selling our products. Our team had the capability to help our customers shop for accessories and apparel it was fun working with this company making deliveries.Our products are house hold equipment, electronics, furniture, computers and appliances."
good,"Enjoy my co-workers, job.  Only issue is distance of job.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
good,"The first thing I did when i went to work was taking a tour of the store to see what needed improving and make a list so it could be done right away. Turn on all electronics and as soon as the store was open greet and help customers, take their payments. Also responsible for marketing and cleanliness of the store."
good,I have the opportunity to meet different people and help dreams come true!
good,Aaron's overall is a great place to work but the hours are long and the pay not so great unless you are a GM. Plenty of opportunity for advancement if you are a hard worker and they have a good system set in place.
good,it was a good job. the pay was a lil low but overall the company is a successful company
good,Lugar apto para aprender a manejar los clientes y poder hacer crecer tu experiencia
good,I enjoyed working here I just hated the sales part and the long hours.. this is not good for a person with small children or a family but the people I worked with was awesome
good,"Aarons is a very unique business, with a specific demographic niche. Its a tough business and sometimes stressful.  But their business plan is top notch and proven.  It truly provides a service for those who may not be able to afford retail. Its challenging and exciting, the only downside being work/personal life balance."
good,Great company to work for with great benefits and coaching to advance.  The workday hours are based on everyday staffing needs.  Aaron's provides great tools for learning.
good,"I liked working there, everybody was nice and good pay. I liked the scheduled hours an two days off a week. I enjoyed getting purchased items to the customers. You meet a lot of nice people."
good,"Good place to work, stayed about a year. Great manager, good hours. Pay just doesn’t cut it if you have bills. Team work always worked when it came to reaching sales goals. Relaxed environment."
good,"A typical day at work we have a meeting to look at the goal for the day so we can hit the goal for the week.... I learned to help customer with their needs,and the most of all treat them like family...i love working at Aaron's the only part i didn't like and that's why i left company was because new managers they didn't care about employee's as much..... they just want $$$$.... so sad because i worked at company for more that 5 years.."
good,"IT is a very nice place to work, great people to communicate with, nice stuff to buy and rent from, tge people that work there are very nice to you.They always willing to help you"

good,I enjoyed working at Aarons. I meet new faces every day. It was a easy paced company. You had the opportunity to make more more money through commissions.
good,My experience there was great if they had an opening where I moved to I would still be with them. In terms I would work for them again if the opportunity presented itself. Good fast pace work flow.
good,"there are always things to do so the days fly by. "
good,work day is decent management is ok hardest part is working is by yourself in delivering heavy furniture up stairs the most enjoyable part is meeting new people
good,"I enjoyed talking, listening to our customers. It was a good feeling to be able to get them merchandise that they wanted and could afford. I did not like the way some employees talked to the customers. Very rude and sometimes nasty.  We were there to help our customers. I was able to learn from my Manager. He was eager to train and teach and was very dedicated to the company."
good,it was a great place to work I enjoyed every minute of it I just had to leave the state to be closer to my toddler son it was very fun it was something different everyday
good,"A typical day at work starts at 9 AM with my call list for the day and hack at it one call at a time, then head out on the field to do my field visits. I have managed 4-5 associates at a time, the only hard part of the job would have to be field visiting in the 100+ degree summer weather. Woking here for five years has given me a different view on people and how you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover because there are many wonderful people in this world and full of life and I have had the pleasure in getting to know some of these customers by doing my job."
good,My coworkers are easy to work with. We have a great working environment. Our duty is to ensure that our customers are satisfied and we go over and beyond to guarantee that.
good,I've worked for Aaron's for a year and half. It's a very fullfilling career and the other employees are great. The possibilities for moving up in the company is endless.
good,"I love working for this company, I would advise anyone to start a career with this franchise"
good,"meeting and servicing customers, delivering furniture to customers"
good,"It was a great place to work . I enjoyed the hours , the work and the pay . The work load was never overbearing . Management was very helpful . If the company would have never been bought out i would probably still be working there , as a manager or supervisor by now"
good,I enjoyed working there. I loved the pay and experience. I just realized I wasn’t fit to be a sales woman. It also was a struggle being the only woman working there. They do have a great business though.
good,"Aaron's is a great and exciting place to work, they truly care for their employees and they are always doing fun and exciting competitions for each store."
good,There is always plenty to do so you stay busy. It can be challenging but rewarding. The management was great when I worked there. Pay was decent and benefits were decent.
good,"It was a fun envorinment to work in, coworkers were awesome, sometimes you had rude customers, but that comes with every job."
good,"depend on your position you have different duties,but they all require teamwork. take a little time to get us to marketing or selling if you never been in marketing and sales."
good,"Advanced increasingly responsible positions in a timely manner. Responsible for the acquisition and maintenance of customers; directed immediate contact with customers who had not renewed their Lease agreements; acted as a customer counselor reselling the benefits of timely lease agreement renewal payments; documented all customer promises & updated customer information in the store computer system; filed a report on any charge-offs, surrenders or lost merchandise.  Focal points."
good,"I answer phones and assist customers with prices for merchandise, file complaints, or give them information pertainting to their business or account. My co-workers are very friendly and hard workers. I enjoy assisting the customers but the hardest part is trying to make sales over the phone. My supervisors are very understanding and friendly as well."
good,Aaron nice place to work either I enjoy work around customer everyday.And meet friends everyday.
good,a typical work day included fixing appliances and delivering furniture to customers. I learned how to fix and set up all different types of appliances.the hardest part of the job was working with difficult customers but was good expierence.
good,"i loved working at Aarons Inc, it’s definitely a job i would recommend. the staff there are very helpful and friendly. they are very professional and prober excellent customer service."
good,Place was exciting throughout seasons of the year to enjoy with the customers. I would love to still be a part of the aaron family. Having to work long days and weekends the job got boring with the pay and i felt that i would do better at another job and having more pay will definitely be more concrete for my skills in customer service
good,The job it good places to work at Aaron. I was helper we have to pick up on furniture as bring to people houses and if don't finish in time we have overtime. We go people house make them feel comfortable as laugh and communicate with them while we put they furniture in the house.
good,"Coworkers all got along. We helped when needed, we treated everyone as an equal. hardest part of the job was satisfying all customers to their own wants and needs. Most enjoyable part was seeing families happy with their product."
good,I love working for Aarons Sales And lease because I was able to meet new people assist with customer issues as well as making decisons
good,"The store that was in York, SC was the worst place I’ve ever worked  The manager was on an ego trip and the owner was nothing more than a micro manager that had nothing better to do than watch the cameras and complain about everything.  I wasn’t allowed to do my job and was made to feel stupid by the manager.  9 months was way too long at this store"
good,Horrible experience due to the manager that they had at the time. They want to send you all over the place and take everyone’s furniture over bring a few days late on their payment. No help out in the field. Dangerous parts of the town is included. Can careless about your life other than theirs.
good,Job was tiring how to deal with too many different people not wanting to pay their bills and really who wants to see a bill collector coming or knocking on their door
good,"I was able to maintain a 95% collection rate to get our customers to ownership. We worked as a team and my co[-workers would help each other.  The hardest part of the job was trying to collect money from customers that did not qualify to receive a leasing agreement.  Also after 30 days of non payment I was required to repossess our merchandise.  I physically could no longer remove washers, dryers, large flat screen TVS etc by myself which was part of my job. I usually worker 10[-12 hour days"
good,"I enjoyed most of my career with Aarons, but had to make a change.  Decided to move forward, and not stay stagnant.  Life changes, and other personal issues helped with the decision.  I am looking for more income, and also, a different business.  Rent to own, has given me the right tools to move forward, and continue to grow with this new life."
good,loved working for this company they just wanted me to re-locate and the new location was just to far 
good,selling products and communicationg with people. assembling products and placing them out for show.
good,i moved around 5000 pounds a day with this company if you are not into hard labor then this is not the place for you carting washers or refrigerators up stares sometimes by your self or loading a queen mattress by yourself these are topical for aarons other then that not a bad place.
good,If you like dealing with customers daily seeing smiles one there faces after signing agreements. Aarons sales and Leasing is the company for you to work at.
good,"Working for Aaron's furniture was a great learning experience but it's not worth the time lost with my family, was working every day and when I would have a day off for family it was during the week and my family was all either at work or at school. I really wish they would consider their employees and the time lost from family and close the store on Sunday"
good,Easy job as long as you know what you are doing. Ive learned alot about managing accounts and running accounts. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management who doesnt want to do their job.
good,"great job. lot of work for good pay. Bonus structure makes you want to win, Manager isnt smart. Lacks at his job, im not the only one that will say that."
good,"I've learned a lot about the lease to own industry, I have worked for Corporate and Franchise and Aarons is a wonderful company to work for. I started as a manager trainee and was promoted up the ranks to a General Manager. They believe in promoting from within the pool of talented employees that they have."
good,"My duty at my job was, being nice to all my customers and helping them to get what they wanted. I've learned that there's no bad customers just misunderstandings. "

good,- the typical day at work consists of 15 hour days filled with a long list of priorities that are needed to be completed. Management is the best part of the job.
good,"Aaron's is a place where you want to move most of the day. "
good,The regional Manager will always come in once a week and just constantly de-grade you and not try and teach you anything. I always enjoy working with customers and employees I just feel as the company doesn't do anything to teach you what they want and never try and uplift their employees
good,A typical day at work was pretty good. I learned how to operator human machine interface based programs. Management wasn't updated as well as it needed to be being that it was a new company but the co-workers were nice and fun to work with.

good,It’s a good for people that is just starting to have job experience but from the position you start you don’t have a chance to growth. No salary race expected.
good,"Working for Aaron's is great if you prefer to be working all the time. I have worked at several locations with this company over the past 10 years, and it seems that certain areas pick and choose what they want to follow as far as company guidelines go. Aaron's has done a lot for me as far as developing my leadership skills, mostly because I wanted it and I took it. However, for a time I was surrounded by such smart and talented individuals that knew how to work together as a team it was easy to absorb what I did... my most recent experience... not so much. I don't feel that should put a huge blemish on the company as a whole. I would not work for Aaron's again at an Operations level, however I do think it's an experience most people would benefit from."
good,Aarons was probably my most important job. I learned so many different things regarding merchandise. Appliances... fixing customers issues. I feel like I was the top of my craft in those 3 years. It was a great experience all around.
good,"I loved the hourly rates, the bonuses and overtime. They paid time and half at cooperate. I moved to a franchised and the pay was horrible. Make sure to work for a cooperate and not a franchise."

good,Ki tracks is so very upbeat that the days you are busy seem to fly by and even days that are slow may be enjoyable. I worked at Ki for 4 years and would offer my time any day to them.
good,Working very long days barely getting any days off. If a problem happens in the store they will just throw you under the bus like your nothing. Don't appreciate hard workers.
good,I assisted the manager with technical issues to expedite the delivery of merchandise to the customers. The problems could be fixed in house which reduced the time of sending it all the way to corperate and back.

The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people from various walks of life.
good,I really loved the job It was very laid back and everyone treated me very kind there. The job is well worth the life and time.
good,In my time at Aarons it was a great work experience and I enjoyed the actual lessons that I learned from being in the work force and I enjoyed those lessons that I recieved.
good,What more can be said about serving your great Nation and receiving every benefit in the world. No better place to work than in the military. The only bad part is the moving around every few years. but then again that is good cause you can get away from the leadership that you dont like.
good,Great company to work for. Give you the tools to succeed at your job. Would recommend for anyone looking for a career. .Plenty of chance to advance
good,I processed and input information. I greeted and helped customers. I cleaned and organized the store. I made coffee twice daily. Etc.
good,"Every day you get to experience giving a person something they want at a cheaper price than most rental places that they could not otherwise afford at retail value. This makes people happy and excited when the aaron's truck shows up to deliver their furniture whatever it may be. We provide great service, free delivery, and a friendly environment."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and general company policies."

good,"A typical day at work was normall very hectic and burnt the day away in a flash. But i like stress in doses, like at work or the drive home."
good,"Working has been a joy.  It provides the joy of customer service, helping customer to acquisition and maintain merchandise, and also develops relationships with your customers.  The ability to understand that no day will be the same because of the many different type of customers that you will come in contact with.  Your at work for 8 to 12 hours a day and the same staff, no part timers, they in some ways become part of your family.  It allows you to know each others strengths and weaknesses, and to use that knowledge to work as a team to be a successful store.  The hardest part of the job is when you have to go to a customers home and perform returns on merchandise because our goal is to them to ownership.  When you return their product, depending on the situation, sometimes you feel as tho you have failed them and you didn't do your job to the best of your ability.  But at the end of day the relationships that you develop with the customers is the best part of the job."
good,It was a ok job the best part of the job over all was working with the customers
good,"•Conducted inventory of new merchandise and recorded the shipment into the store computer files."

good,"I was a Product Technician, assembled and delivered various product and set-up in customer's houses."
good,Company provides a great working enviornmetn with top quality associates. Pays well and has great benifits
good,"Working for this company was great. What I learned about this company is that you get to meet customers who are attorneys, doctors, nurses, accountants, and quite a few of other business people. The people who are poor, this would be an awesome company to establish a good credit history because you don't need credit with this company but only a job or a source of income. What people don't know is that Aaron's prices are just like any finance company except they give loaners if you have a service issue. The coworkers are great except the new manager whom I knew from my previous job at Les Feldser who always had money shortage at his own store who he managed and I did not trust. I informed my manager who was getting replaced by him but he seem not to care because he was getting promoted with a big bonus. The hardest part of this job is having to trust those who don't seem honest and denying poor people who did not have enough income. The most enjoyable about this job is approving customers who did not have credit and paid great on their accounts."
good,One of my favorite job's ever. Every day there was something different to do. If the pay would have been better i would still be there
good,You always got to meet somone new everyday. I liked being able to make someone happy with the work that I was doing.
good,"a day in the life of a sales manager included lots of paper work but most important was the sales, i was in charge of the csr and product technicians who i had to learn to delegate to and hold accountability,ive learned to have faith in myself and confidance, the hardest part was getting people to buy stuff"
good,"fast-paced, mainly customer service and sales based environment, keeping up showroom floor and cleanliness of merchandise"
good,They cared about there employees except when it came to another store needing help then they didnt care how far u had to drive u had to do it or get fired
good,"Aprendi a ser la mejor en servicio al cliente."
good,"Working at Aarons is amazing, fun and fast paced. The biggest draw back to the company is the amount of hours you have to put in to be sucessful. Kiss any home life goodbye, but the rewards are great if youre willing to put in your time"
good,Keep you active I learned more about Excel than i had known.  I monitored the drivers delivering to each location and transferring the product to the store.
good,"Loved working here, sadly the location closed down.. team work and nice hours! I even love shopping here, always have what I need. I give it two thumbs up, working wise or shopping wise"
good,i only worked here to help pay for school this is not a job for an adult trying to make a living when i started the paid me 9.00 an hour so yea if thats something ypur into then go for it
good,"I loved working at Aarons, management was great, rules applied to everyone, even the manager. Training is great. If you are willing to spend most of your time away from your family this is the job for you."
good,A place where you learn to do a lot of everything. Gained good office and sales experience as well as working the phones. Friendly competition between other stores...
good,"I loved working for Aarons, but was just purchased by RAC, and was not happy, and just wanting to get back on board. I really enjoyed my staff and all 570 customers i had. Iloved making customers dreams come true."
good,If you are a workaholic and you love long hours and stressful environments.Then this is the place for you to excel. Benefits are great and commission when it does come is very nice.
good,"work is work, I love been on  the truck traveling to see different site,  its all fun until you have to delivery to apt complex.. but I love my job"
good,I love working with my customers.The only reason I'm looking for a change is the local Aaron's stores are franchised and its nearly impossible to move up in the company once you reach the general manager position
good,"I was the General Mgr., which meant I had to oversee Sale and Colletions, set daily and monthly projections, ordering merchandise, keeping up with the hot trends on what's selling and what's not, balance warehouse and showroom new and preleased sticks.."
good,"Aaron's is a fast work paced environment with plenty to keep you busy. A normal day consists of greeting every customer as they enter, and helping them out with any needs they may have. Whether it's questions as they're browsing regarding merchandise, making a payment, solving a service issue, or any other general concerns they may have. Aaron's has different departments that allow us to better serve the customers. I help with the route schedule for the deliveries, fill any empty holes on the showroom (product replacement), and keep track of inventory weekly. I also take care of any service issues that may ensue also issue loaner items if applicable. I have learned a lot through Aaron's as I also sit and talk with customers and explain their lease contracts with them. We all work together to obtain the same goal, acquisition and maintenance of our customers."
good,It was a great place to work. The environment was great i loved my co workers they were the best and the accounts office could be better the only hard part is constantly going up and down stairs
good,"It’s a great Company to work for, I had a good experience with my co workers and managers , no only that they work with you, but also depending on your team and manager they will give you the tools needed to succeed"
good,At Aaron's I have found that the management team is a great fit. It takes a great team to be able to complete the assignments given on a day to day basis.
good,"I had fun working there for the time I worked it was a comfortable safe place, good teamwork an many different things to learn. It's a good experience learning new attitudes."
good,"Has its Pros and Cons just like everything else. "
good,Needs to be more family oriented and better pay to match the economic climate. Great customer base and understanding of that base. Always a willingness too help its customers.
good,If willing to work hard and make a difference Aaron's is the place to be. Long hours and decent benefits package. Very results orientated. Love the interactions with customers both good and bad.
good,It was a great experience working with Aaron's and also the customers when handling customers accounts I built relationships with the customers the store could have been managed a little better but we worked great together
good,"good place to get furniture, but just watch your pay if you are going to work there. the PT's also endure a lot from the customer and from the staff, making work more difficult."
good,At Aarons a CSR is responsible for answering multi-line phone. They are responsible for greeting customers. We also try to provide customers with merchandise that they are looking for to manage their home. I learned customer service skills. I also learned about furniture and electronics. My co-workers are very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is nothing. It is very easy environment to work in. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you make customers happy with merchandise they can now afford in their homes.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Aaron's and would consider going back to work for them in the future when certain change in my lifestyles happen. The reason I had to quit Aaron's was because my personal life couldn't coincide with work. After I graduated from Clemson, I decided to move to Charleston because of the endless possibilities and fast-paced life style and Aaron's required me to work until 10 pm every night. This forced me to drop all of my weekday activities and most of my weekend ones too. All that being said; I really enjoyed the work and the opportunity to advance as high as possible with hard work. I honestly miss the relationships that I worked so hard to build with my customers and wish Aaron's the best of luck."
good,"on the phone calling customer that did not make their payments for thelease agreement on merchandise. co-workers were team players, the hardest part was having to re-possess the merchandise from customers that did not make their payment. Love working with people"
good,"A typical day was organizing 300 plus store designs and working with a great team of employees. The most important thing I learned during my tenure was that as a team we could acheive anything. As part of the management staff we assisted and worked on and with each team unit. The management and employees were not separated during the work day. As long as you stayed on track the team and yourself never had a hard day. Leaving this position to advance my career and future was the only hard point. The team and company was the enjoyable points,"
good,"im just trying to create my own resume im not sure why youre asking me all of this stuff lol, Aarons is in my past im on to better things now lol and don't judge my applications by this"
good,I loved the people I worked with and the flexibility with home and work was the best pay wasn’t to bad either can get stressful at times and the Corporation always changing management around and micromanaging but if you can work around that then it’s a great place to work
good,"Loved working here just needed better pay."
good,Great company & people. Aaron's is a Great place to work. My time there was enjoyable. Upper management was always present & benefits were great. Made great friends for life
good,productive fun good workers good pay good supervisiors good breaks nice vacations good benefits hour lunches a nice fun place to work with nice customers.
good,"Learned a lot of customer service and management, each day you learn something new."
good,"Aaron's is a great company with job security as long as one does what they are supposed to do. However, the only down fall is that there is very little time for any time with your family and friends during the week because the hours are all day. Overtime is expected."
good,"changing/updating price cards, sales, product knowledge, filing, cash transactions, application forms,"
good,"The Acquisition and Maintenance of Customers "
good,Thrived on the day to day challenges of collections. Found satisfaction in helping customers achieve ownership of their merchandise.
good,The job work to life balance is the really big thing for me here. I work 8am - 9pm. I am gone from 7am - 10pm almost everyday so i really have no life with my family.
good,Having the opportunity to meet customers needs with merchandise is exciting. Enjoying the day with co-workers and being able to help out in all areas including staging to sales floor etc. Having a manager that keeps us laughing but maintains order of the work flow. only downfall for me is being on my feet for sometimes hours at a time.
good,I loved working for this company. I actually helped opened this store. I was hired by my Ex-Store Manager from Rent-A-Center. We stayed in touch and I called him about a job. I loved the products that we sold. I would still probably be working there if they had not rehired a Manager that was very rude to customers and to his employees.
good,"Typical day at Aaron's for me was, preparing and loading merchandise for delivery. Completeing deliveries. managing customer retention and sales to a certain degree. Door to door marketing. Cleaning warehouse. Hardest part of this job was wanting to advance but never getting the chance. Most enjoyable was the customer appreciation parties."
good,"Had a good overall experiance with Aaron's, If your willing to put in the hours, and work with your bosses you will advance quickly."
good,"Worked with my Dad for about 2 years,was a good overall time. Company is now disvoled"
good,"A typical day would be,"
good,I loved this job wish I was still hete. This job gave me a lot of work experience all major clerical experience. I learned how to work well with people. How to interact with other employees.
good,"Aaron's is a great place to work. They now offer part time positions even. Everyone has a potential to earn commission, even the delivery drivers. Wages are fair! There are yearly performance raises. And corporate does contests all the time which makes it fun! Fast paced, but in a good way!"
good,Aaron's gave me the opportunity to learn many different things being there. On an average day it was very hectic from sales to collecting money and rearranging the store to adhere company rules.
good,"Now that my children are "" grown and gone"" I'm ready to work hard for a great retired life in the future. I enjoyed the comrodery behind the bullpit."
good,The best part of the Job is the new people you meet every day. There is always someone new coming through the door. The hours can be long but a successful day is worth it.
good,"Definitely a starting opportunity to get your fooe in the door, I’m this Line of work.This job is fast paced learning and you will learn the necessities you need to learn from other places as well"
good,Aaron's drives for results. It transforms you into a strong goal oriented individual. Motivates one to become the best you can. Offers Reward to those who don't give up.
good,"I like working there, great opportunities, great environment, great coworkers , fair earning , great culture , everything is great , super great , great great great"
good,The job itself was pretty cool no complaints it’s management thats actually terrible. The pay was also a plus if Hounding people down and taking their stuff when they don’t pay is for you then this is perfect
good,"I strongly believe that Aarons would be the greatest workplace ever if the work scheduling would be different. Working for the company, in general, is awesome! I just have a hard time balancing family time with my Aarons work schedule; especially now that it's open on Sundays."
good,"If you started out as a product tech, or PT and moved to a sales manager or SM position you didn’t receive a merit increase at all. So a bunch more responsibility and no pay increase."
good,I started as a delivery driver and accomplished a six figure salary and was well trained in my position and enjoyed who I worked with and loved the daily challenges the job offers
good,"Aarons is great to work for when you have the best guideance and leadership, when you have a boss who has given you all tje right tools and keys for advancement . but then work for a regional manager who does not know your worth and losses you after all the hard work a general manager invested in you..and the regional due to favortisim losses you a great worker"
good,Aarons is a  great place to wokr if you are single and ready to commit and help the company grow as if it were your own company. It has fulltime and long hours and you have 2 days off a week. Including every sunday.
good,Really enjoyed working for this company. Like the fact that they promote from within. They have a great attention to detail for the customer experience.
good,"typical work at for me at Aarons is coming in getting straight to work or if I have no idea what to do I turn to my boss and he'll direct me I actually learned a lot at Aarons like how to file paperwork way better my customer service skills has improved. definitely a fun environment for me, the hardest part of the job is hitting that sales goal so we can receive commission and the most enjoyable part of the job is our team work."
good,This is a very competitive and stressful job. Selling merchandise is a must. The pay is great and so are the benefits. Paid sick days and vacation time
good,was a great place to work i just wasent set to really work there i had family problems that made me ungratefull to work there i still had alot of growing up to do and i really hope i get to go back there soon one day i miss this company
good,I am a current employee here and I enjoy everyday at work from coming in contact with so many different appliances to all of the wonderful customers I meet on a day to day basis.
good,"In a typical day you can deal with typical retail situations.  Expect typical management involvement, and typical work stresses."
good,In order to do this job you must be able to communicate and diffuse situations. Otherwise you will not like the nature of the business.
good,"Following policy, start at 8 a.m. Daily goals communicated, route mapped out, easily explained and achievable. Great skill to learn and great people to meet. Depending on your manager, your day will go smoothly. Hardest part of the job is collections, trying to remove unpaid merchandise from disgruntle customers, but if all goes too far the authorities are called and handled from there."
good,I tend to always have enough to do and loved inside or outside working and in bound and outside calls.All sales and teamwork was dealt with employees together.
good,"Great employees, strong reliable company, with good benefits. "
good,"A regular workday was planning out delivery/pickup schedule.  In addition, planning with my Sales Manager a sales/marketing route.  I've learned to be patient with management .. I loved my coworkers, they were helpful and all about the customers.  The hardest part of the job was scheduling to meet customer satisfaction.  The most enjoyable part of the job was marketing, door to door tagging, sales calls to prior customers and local store visits."
good,"great advancement opportunities and fun work environment. Managers work 45 - 50 hours per week. Not a great work life balance, due to starting work at 10am and closing at 7pm. Pay also needs major improvement. You will gain a lot of knowledge and experience."
good,"as soon as I get in I walk my showroom to check and see if anything needs to be cleaned or replaced on floor, after I get delivery drivers ready to deliver merchandise for customers, after they leave then I proceed to handle my service log for any outstanding customer services. then take lunch for about an hour. after that i work on new sales leads and acquire new business by walking/or internet leads."
good,My experience here was definitely one I will never forget. My co-workers were all very colorful people. Each day was an adventure. I loved being able to help my customers find the merchandise they desired to help them complete their homes. It was a very laid back job. The hardest part was probably moving and unboxing furniture that weighed more than I did. Luckily the product technicians were always willing to help.
good,"I loved working at Aaron's, this place of employment was very active and never a dull moment. It was a retail/sales environment. I constantly stayed busy. The hardest part of this job was not meeting goal for the end of the month sales for the entire store. My co-workers were beyond helpful and always made the work place fun and very exciting."
good,a typical day would start with loading work truck with merchandise to be delivered to customers home or pickup of merchandise that is unpaid for or in need of repair. Most enjoyable part of my job is that I'm never along in or outside the company and I have I hour lunch breaks. The hardest part of any day is repossessing delinquent or unpaid for merchandise. Some customers become irate and angry over losing their merchandise.
good,Very easy days moving TV's tables etc. learned of to repair items in the store if needed good positive management fun coworkers relaxed and a claim place to work the hardest part moveing the larger items up or down stairs of a home the best part was the whole job nothing I can think of that made me dislike it
good,good place to work everyone is friendly. easy to get along with
good,"Work hard and under stand a P/L statement. Every if your nor a GM your Hourly, Range from 8.00-12.50 hr. rate. Long nights."
good,"Make payment calls, and deliver/ pick up merchandise. Kinda like a collections job. management was good as far as i could tell, fun co workers. hardest part of the job was calling about past due payments."
good,"enjoyed this job very much, enjoyed the people"
good,Very challenging customer service. There is never a boring day.
good,Really learned from this company how to better maintain a repore with the customer
good,meeting new people and learning more about Aaron's. I like working for aarons because I like to drive and delivery furniture to ppl who can't afford top dollar furniture and it makes me happy to see a smile on a customer's face.
good,I really like the work atmosphere I like working in a team environment. I work well with others. And I enjoy doing jobs when I have to drive from one site to another.
good,It was a face paced environment. If you ever needs help with anything someone was always there to answer any questions. You always hand someone with you to help move furniture or appliances.
good,"Great company that seems to have lost its way. The foundation of the company was the core of the one time greatness. While adapting to the current business environment, the company has forgotten what and who made it great."
good,Great company to work for. You can build your career from any position. Core values and structure is in place for everyone to follow. This company promotea within. Good company to start a career with.
good,"Always about helping you own your possessions "
good,typical day included comming in and not knowing what the day consisted of. Days were longer than they were supposed to be because the route where not managed properly.
good,The place its self is wonderful i love my job the benefits and the people but management is not what what it should be other then that it id a great career job

good,"Working at Aaron's has been fulfilling to me until now.  Once you get to the point where you dread seeing your boss come to work, its time to move on to another job."
good,"At Aarons I learned a lot from gaining more experience in customer service and in sales ,Managent their were great always very helpful. The hardest part was all the incoming calls u took"
good,"Aaron's was a great place to work."
good,"A day at work was routine, load and unload trucks make sure everything was accounted for and that was it.I learned to read an order form while working there.Management and co-workers were all good people and there were no hard parts!!!"
good,"Aaron's was a very calm yet intimidating job atmosphere, but it was enjoyable to show up to work. The co-workers were amazing and very informative. Any question I had was answered to the T. Dealing with rude customers was a daily struggle, but with the support of my team, we managed to make everyone satisfied in the end. Working here was an awesome experience! I would love to do it again!"
good,This company was the first rent to own and only lease ownership business. It has been around for 61 years and continues to grow. Locations are all over North America. There are few cities that do not have an Aarons near by.
good,"It was a fun place to work as I never stayed in one position long I always moved up in the company as I ended up GM in 2012."
good,"Daily reports, Inventory, Scheduling employees and appointments for customers. Daily Sales goals as well as daily collection goals."
good,"The years I worked for this company was amazing."
good,"Aaron's is a high pressure and high activity environment where there is no time to slow down and everything has to be done yesterday. That said, I really enjoyed that portion of the business, but interacting with customers and promoting sales was what I love doing there. A typical day started by opening the store and turning off the alarms. The store was then walked to make sure everything was opening ready and all electronics were both turned on and secure. I was responsible for the drivers and I one CSR to assist me with the front end activities of attracting customers and closing sales. Almost every coworker I  knew were great people who cared about their performance and making the store better."
good,"Fun work place, very supportive, outgoing, management. Great work environment, Awesome team work, awesome co-workers, helping each other open, clean, organize, and close the store, there is always a helping hand no one is left to do something by themselves."
good,It has been an amazing experience to work for this company! My co- workers and I have created a bond like no other. We are that dysfunctional family that gets along great most of the time. Everyone works together as a team. We all fall even if only one of us falls.
good,Started morning making collection calls to guest that were past due.  This was 80% of the job.  In the evening usually made home visits for people that were not able to be reached by phone.
good,"A typical day at work started with pulling delivery tags to see what the day has in store. With the tags in hand, I would hunt for the items to make sure the salesmen did not sale an item not available.  After preparing the deliveries, the delivery truck needs inspection to make sure it is in proper running condition.  Once the inspection is complete, I would load the truck with deliveries, check my route and start.  I learned how to deal with customer complaints in a manner that leaves the customer satisfied.  The hardest part of the job was the delivery locations, sometimes the furniture would have to be delivered to the third or fourth floor.  I love working with customers and knowing that I had a role in their happiness."
good,"On a typical day at work you perform many different duties on the sales team."
good,"Excellent management"
good,Great place to work just need more money and opportunities to grow
good,A company that has a good rep for taking care of the employees and making sure everyone is customer service friendly
good,"Got delivery orders, loaded up truck and made deliverys all day till finished."
good,"Very hard working person looking to start a career, and build a future for myself."
good,"Aaron's is growing, which is not a story you hear at many places. They are in an exciting expansion phase and are dabbling with an international presence."
good,"deliver rental merchandise to customers in the community, service and repair store owned merchandise. Received payments and assist customer needs.I had a great time to work with and around."
good,"I handled heavy furniture for delivery and had a great team working with me. Work at self pace, in which I was very productive and always finished the job early just waiting for new tasks. The hours were flexible and worked the early first shift which started at 2 a.m. and ended whenever all tasks were done, usually around 10:30 a.m. I enjoyed every moment working at Aaron's and the hardest part was just waiting around for a new task to do."
good,the work is great especially if you are good at sales but raises dont really happen and it is hard to move up. unless you start in a place of management you are pretty much stuck where you are.
good,"I was with Aaron’s for Almost 2 years as a Customer Account Manager! I absolutely loved the position, my customers, and working in that dept. as a manager I do feel like I was under paid which sucked because I did love it. I did everything the general manager did plus run my credit dept. The monthly bonuses are great if you meet the credit dept goals! Overall I will miss working here more than anything  it was just no longer doable for me to do due to the times I had to wor"
good,Good company to work for and lots of room for growth if that's what your looking for.... It's a great job even if your not looking for a management positions
good,Great place to work.Only problem is very long hours.There is alot of opportunities for advancement.They make you feel like part of a family.Always offer great bonuses as well.
good,Fast-paced work environment always lots of things to be done keeping you busy moving the day along. great company policies and corporate involvement strong daily goals and weekly meetings for achieving them. 10 out of 10 GM involvement and help to ensure you achieve goals. Great store to be a part of.
good,"There's plenty of time for opportunities and advancement and learn more if you want to do that. The training never stops weather at store or regional or corporate level ,the money there also if you have drive to help good people this is a must have job I'm 5 years in I'm never leaving Aaron's is a one in a lifetime opportunity as a employee never thought I would a work place I could call home home I have and if you get a chance please take it"
good,"Long hours and hard work, but good pay, and benefits. Would recommend to someone who needs a steady income but must have flexiable hours and be willing to wait for a good work schedule"
good,overall the customers and the employees make you feel welcom. Listening to music all day allowing you to be yourself. the confidence to want to go in to work everyday was the best feeling all in itself. I love the friendly compitions between employees and the company itself awards their employees very well during these competitions as well
good,"Aaron's is a really great place to work if you don't mind the leasing business, If I had any interest in the products we offered I probably would have stayed forever. You get to work with customers that you build lifelong relationships with. The workplace culture there was always pleasant even when it was slow or we were understaffed. The management were always on top of things and I have hardly anything negative to say about the company as a whole."
good,I loved it there would of never left if I didn't have to great people to work with. And it was some hard work but also some easy days. Great place to work.
good,"I would arrive at 8:30 am turn off alarm, pull deliveries make sure agreements fully processed.walk around store create to do list for drivers/csr. verify delivery,pick up,service order time by calling customers, around 9. start coffee.bank drop, when sales team arrives  we set our own sales goals.I remind them of how many more new agreements are needed. everyone  checks off list with signiture.when a job is complete. Now its time to meet and great. CSF goals to make everyone a owner. take hr lunch.drivers are to complete truck checklist.Before using and after. Over all Aarons is a great work place. When my daughter passed Aarons paid for everything but her headstone, Aarons is a place where you move up, within the co.haed work pays off. customers are sometimes a pain, (not all). I personally Loved my job at Aarons.hardest part of the job trying to keep up with no whole policy. when store was busiest. enjoyable part for me is having satisfied cutomers."
good,"Input daily deposits along with A/P and A/R.  Bi-weekly payroll and end of month reports.  Enjoyed working with all of my co-workers, management was very nice and fair to all employees."
good,Challenging position and rewarding through enterprising with customers and other business'. would consider this a good place to work in a growing and highly motivated atmosphere.
good,For my position I always remember that I am the last face the customers see. Always make sure I do a red carpet delivery and make sure the customer is happy.
good,I worked there for a little bit over two years in Ottumwa Iowa one of the best general managers around great staff learned a lot just could not work late hours
good,It was a very fun job to work everybody communicated well everybody helped each other you learned something new almost every month and pretty organize warehouse
good,"Career driven business. Their customers are their business you get to know them by first names and they feel like family."
good,Clock in make phone calls help accounts become current or offer other was to help customer in a way that benefits them working side by side with my manager. work is family oriented.
good,"teach you how to be very professional to customers and potential. customers . you will learn strategic ways to generate sales, manage accounts and learn product features."
good,Company has  a lot of positive
good,Numbers driven business. Always chasing that number. Great seems to never be good enough. Solid company that isn't going anywhere but you work way to much as a salaried associate. No work/life balance.
good,"A typical day at work involved making sure the store was clean and electronics were on for opening. I would help customers with their accounts, and also help new customers with going on a lease. I learned how to develop relationships with all of my clients and co-workers. Management was amazing, well with the people I worked with. the culture was good as well. There was really no hard part about the job because it was just fun working there."
good,"Great job loved the fast paced day to day operations- Never a dull moment.  days can stretch into 12 hour shifts with little to no breaks.  No sick time available, hard to call in if you are sick"
good,"Enjoyed my time at aarons and actually loved my job. The position helped me better myself. The people I worked with made me feel very comfortable to where I came out my shell and became a different person but in a good way, commission always motivated me to work extra also working with customers there made me see value in the customers we help."
good,"Working for an Aarons franchise can be very hot or cold. I have worked for two. Some franchises are very organized and employee friendly, others aren't."
good,"I learned a lot from Aaron's furniture inc "
good,"As an Aaron's General Manager I took on the tough stores and generally excelled. The only reason I left Aaron's is because I could see the store I opened was never meant to work and was done to appease corporate. I managed to turn a profit at the location within about 8 months, something no one expected. I worked long hours and 6 days a week. This was also my choice many times I was told to go home or take a Saturday off, but when you are opening a new location you have to sacrifice to make it work too. I have worked in 4 stores starting in Oneonta, NY then to Idaho Falls, ID promoted to GM in Logan, UT and ended in Blackfoot, ID. If you work hard enough you can get promoted but Aaron's is strictly a numbers game. If you do not produce you will not be around long either just like with any other company."
good,"It was a decent job and easy to setup products at a customer's home. The days were not too long but for the amount of work they had everyone doing, i feel as if everyone was not getting paid correctly."
good,"Great place to work under great management. I have worked there for a few years, it is great! I find the corporation side of the company to be more structured and organized. I am enjoying it thus far."
good,I loved working here. Great opportunity to move up in management. Also got lots of bonuses for meeting goals. I would recommend working here if you love challenges
good,"my experience with Aarons was great, there i develop my sales craft and management skills, it provided me with the opportunity to grow within the company in a competitive environment in-which personal performance and team accomplishments are equally valued."
good,"Aaron's is a great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunity for someone who is willing to put forth the effort. At times I could have workdays as short as 5 hours, or as long as 15 if I so desired (which I often did)."
good,I was always on the go.  Sometimes I started there at 10a.m. and didn't leave til 10p.m. I learned a lot about appliances t.v.s computers and other electronics. I worked with good people and I always loved my management and they always thanked me for my hard work. I loved making customers happy!
good,From day one I loved the training program that Aaron's has in place. It is a great company to work for and I had a great oppertunity
good,"great place to work, friendly work environment. meet new people everyday. fast pace place to work"
good,"A typical day at work involves moving and cleaning furniture. I drive on average about 120 miles a day. I also deal with our customer's account, as in taking payments and arranging appointments to meet with the customer. I couldn't ask for better management at Aaron's. My co-workers are very hard working and easy to get along with. I enjoy seeing the smile on customers faces once their merchandise is delivered, it warms my heart to see another satisfied customer."
good,"At Aarons I deliver and collect merchandise. I also, in some cases, collect payments. Provide excellent customer service. Its a great place to work for young and able people."
good,A typical day at work with this company involved alot of team work. We would start out with our daily team meeting before opening up the stores. Our objective was to drive sales and provide our customers with the best product for their personal needs. My boss was a lot of fun and always fair. My coworkers became like family and I still keep in contact with them today. I think the hardest part of my job was blending the 55+ hours a week with my personal schedule.The best part of my job was my diverse customer base.
good,"How I would describe a typical day at work would have to be, non-stop, hard work! I take care of 650 customers by scheduling their deliveries, service issues, and new orders of merchandise they desire. I take numerous payments and phone calls. I clean and make sure my floor is full and price. I am responsible for opening and closing the store. Also, I deal with large sums of cash. I have learned from working at Aaron's how to be more organized and responsible. I catch myself trying to do too many things at once. I get along with all of my co-wokers, but the hardest part about my job is too many hours for the amount of pay I receive. I do not enjoy my job for the most part."
good,"I was able to develope a close relationship with our customers because I saw them on such a regular basis. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, especially when I transferred stores. One of the harder aspects of this job would have to be the ten to twelve hour shift required on Fridays. The weekly store meeting was held at nine in the morning and then after opening at ten, we had to work until 8:30-9 that evening. The most enjoyable part of this position was the customer base and the relationships I developed with the staff and upper management."
good,"Good job, but i feel is mainly for those that don't have a family because you will have to work long shifts and also on Sundays. You can easily move up if motivated."
good,"I wake up and I was excited to go to work  everyday and help customers out,  I was the best they had and the best customer service a customer  Could ask for. dedicate myself into helping someone or anybody out."
good,It can be stressful at times we are busy some days and we are slow some days I have bee with Aaron for 9 years started as a manager trainie and worked my way up to where I am now
good,"Working at Aaron's has been one of the best experiences I've had due to in large part that the management really cares about their employees and the success of the store. You are given all the necessary tools to succeed in your role with the company. As a sales manager, your main duties and responsibilities are to develop and implement a marketing program to generate more business, review and close lease agreements with customers, perform routine service calls for customers with issues, assist General Manager with checking inventory and ordering merchandise, and other duties assigned by GM. Only slight downside are the hours, which does not leave much time for other life aspects outside of work, but management is willing to work with you. Otherwise great company to work for!"
good,"Loved my job, something new to do everyday.  Hired as a CSR and promoted to Sales manager within 6 months.   Unfortunately the pay was too low and I had to find something with more pay."
good,"Aaron's on Allentown Rd. in Lima, Ohio is a great place to work if you want peace of mind in your work atmosphere. The Management at this location is superb and easy to talk with. The employees are friendly and helpful. If you're considering a career with them I definitely say go for it, give the team a try. Thanks a lot Aaron's for the professionalism and friendliness especially. May this franchise soar above and beyond the competition now and forever."
good,Working at Aaron's was great it was laid back no stress everyone got along just well. We new our roles and we played our roles at Aaron's. I had to leave because I had got shot on accident outside the workplace but if I could with one wish I would most definitely go back to this workplace.
good,"I love my job, I've loved working for Aaron's these past 10 years.  I have learned so much from managers and co-workers that I will remember going forward.  Recently Aaron's has decided to be open on Sundays, which has always been a day we were closed and a guaranteed day off for GM's who often work 6 days a week.  While I make the schedule for my store, I know there will be weeks when I will not get my two days off in a week, maybe not even one day off.  I love my store, my customers and the company but if something were to come along that paid me the same or more and allowed me to spend more time with my family, I would consider it."
good,Work hard at times but have many breaks. Its a high demand job moving furniture and appliances to sometimes same customers over and over but becomes a home like enviorment with getting to know customers.
good,The company's lease to own service helps make lives better. So interesting and rewarding to serve low income consumers. It's the next best thing to working for a non-profit.
good,Aaron’s was a great company to work for more importantly the owner of the franchise I worked for is an awesome employer. He treats everyone like family rather than and employee.
good,Aarons is like most large corporation type companies they pay on time all the time and want an 8-5 day with an hours break for lunch they pay is above the national average for a gas engineer so not really much to moan about although plenty do! the management in the midlands supported me throughout my time and the training was excellEnt.
good,Overall a decent work environment just need better pay and the lack of overtime...my Bill's are increasing and the pay isn't for a 13 almost 14 year employee
good,"My typical day was very busy. customer service, sales, service issues. The staff made the environment fun to work in. Hardest part of the job was the long hours."
good,"i absolutely loved working at aarons sales and lease.  even the hardest of the work was enjoyable, and often provided me with chances to work with my hands when i wanted to repair products."
good,My only issue with the company was the gm of the store I was in. He had a tendency to disappear for days while still getting paid leaving me to run the store but without the proper training probably not done correctly
good,I enjoyed working at Aaron's it was a experience for me working in accounts or going out to pick up furniture it was a good and fun job and I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,It's a great job when There's just no real room for advancement or compensation I have several goal and dreams to fullfill and I firmly believe that I'm not gonna get these things accomplished at the following job
good,"Typical day at work starts by clocking in, checking to see what needs to be done that day, getting that days paperwork, loading up the truck, delivering to customers, pick up merchandise from customers, service/repair customers merchandise, lots of driving and out of the store if the store is making sales. "
good,Working with Aarons was great experience from the teamwork of all the employees to having great customers. The work wasn't to hard and lifting was a breeze but we did work together a lot to make things happen easy.
good,"Overall Aaron's is a great place to work. The lack of other's willingness to grow and be part of team and make a career causes long hours, and a lot of stress at times. Makes hitting your numbers very difficult and makes you wonder about your job. Other than that i love it."
good,"prepare truck"
good,I loved it here.  I got pregnant while working there and they held my job for my until I got  done with maternity leave.  Everyone that was there when I was there was fun to work with. Would go back if possible.
good,"If you come to work with a positive mind set and ready to sell then you will be alright. I personally loved working here. My bosses were all great and my coworkers were all great. It was like a family. The schedule is a little eh. The store is open Monday-Thursday from 10am-7pm. Fridays we had morning meetings so we had to be there at 9am and we closed at 8pm and then Saturdays it was 10am-5pm and off on Sundays and you also had another day during the week off. Paid holidays. You got a one week vacation after 6 months and then another one at one year. They had good benefits. I was a customer service representative so I was the one at the front desk. I sold merchandise, create files, etc."
good,I have been with this company for 6 years going on 7 I have enjoyed it sometimes it is hard to get the customers to pay their bills on a timely manner late nights and having to go to their homes
good,Aaron's is a great place to work. The company cares about your time being there and makes sure you are taken care of. There is a lot to learn but definitely worth the time.
good,"They have an awesome staff and love throwing events to get all their customers back together and show that they are there for them and they care, Definitely worth stopping by."
good,I love working for errands it was a wonderful company. Have a great training program wonderful benefit and I actually love it's a great company to grow with.
good,"great company, not enough stability. I loved the people. everyone was very welcoming. I would recommend to others. Again not enough stability"
good,We work as a team to accomplish our goals that we have set for us each and everyday. We work very hard as a team to maintain company average each month.
good,"Great management training. More than just retail, its personal growth by helping individuals own merchandise without breaking the bank. The job isn't all work and no play. every employee has a great attitude alongside the managers. Great place to start a career."
good,great job that can help you advance in your customer service ability as well as collections. good encouraging enviornment and the management is very helpful and hands on.
good,"I would drive a car around, and hang door flyer's on the door to show customer what deal's we had. my co-workers were great. Really was not no hard stuff to do out there. I really like it there."
good,a lot of fun challenges every day new learning great work environment every day excited to work of different tasks results and improvements
good,The company is a great place to start a career. I loved the way the are willing to help people who can not afford or does not have the credit to get product anywhere else.
good,"I am currently employed as a Sr, Sales  Manager. I've worked for Aaron's for 6 years consecutively in the past. I can honestly say that it is a great company to work for with advancement opportunities to those who are willing to accept the challenge."
good,"Greeting customers selling the house hold merchandise such as furniture, electronics, computers, televisions, washers and dryers."
good,"Aarons is a wonderful company to work for. The company is big on promoting within. Ive learned a lot from working there, my store manager was alsome and showed me everthing to make me stronger. The hardest part is meeting daily goals, sometimes customers will not buy and theres nothing you can do but aarons dont understand that. I dont like to disappoint myself, nor my manager."
good,"Coming into the expectations were clear, we were to start off by"
good,The only down side to this job was when you had to make people return the things they leased from the company.
good,"Aaron's PT deliverer, brings you the opportunity to work in every single retail environment in the furnishing and electronic business. from the time you help in the show room, handle the merchandise, transport and deliver the merchandise to the costumer. at witch point you have been with the costumer through out his buying experience."

good,"Aaron's is a very fast paced environment, its very customer service oriented and gives you the ability to multitask and manage multiple people at one time. The people I worked with were great and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was there was alot of inventory transfers to keep up with!!!!!!"
good,My day would start by checking out my truck inspecting it and staging my deliveries.I learned how to move furniture really well my management was really great and understanding.My co-workers was very helpful in all aspects of life.The hardest part of the job was long days with huge deliveries.The best part is it was like we were our own boss because once we left the store we followed our task on our own.
good,This is a great company to work for. I would recommend it to anyone.
good,"It was a great place where you never get bored because there was always something to do, one of our main goals was acquisition and maintenance of our customers also developing better employees to get great customer service."
good,"Making sure merchandise is in great condition upon leaving warehouse. Load and unload trucks. Collect payments from customers. I learned to gain great customer service skills by knowing what the customer expects. The management at Aarons is A1 couldnt ask for a better company. My co-workers strive to get the job done right in a timely manner, satisfying the customer to the fullest. The hardest part of the job is staying cool in the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving from a delivery knowing that the customer was satisfied to the fullest before leaving."
good,"Typical day at work you have goals that need to be meet. And you go in with a positive attitude. "
good,"Good place to work for. Long days and weeks, but always willing to help with time off if needed."
good,"Getting the store ready to open at 10am. staging or bring something on the sales floor if we took anything off the floor. Putting merchanice together if needed. Taking payments, helping customers with their needs, typing up lease agreements. I learned all my customer service from here!! The management changed alot while I was employed there.

But over all I enjoyed the workplace itself as well as all the staff and member of the cooperation"

good,Aaron was a great place to work at. Great hours. Got paid vacation. I was able to balance my job and family well. The benefits that i was able to receive were really great.
good,I worked on both sides of the business as a sales man and a account manager. The sales side was the easiest. The customer's know what kind of establishment they were walking into so there was no pressure to sale. They already knew what they wanted and I was there to assist along the journey. Sometimes I had to show them the benefits of a newer model which sharpened my sales skills. They also would have sales competitions to boost moral with extra incentives. The account side was a little trickier due to some customer intentionally not wanting to pay but we had the flexibility to assist with the accounts.

good,"Aaron's is a  fast paced, goal oriented store whose culture is focused  specifically on the customer's satisfaction. 0900 I would come in get out the money drawers and prepare the store for the days work. between 0900 and 1100 the rest of the crew would show up for the days shift. Promptly at 1000 the doors were opened the mornings are usually slow I would use this time inform my sales team of their goals and duties for the day. I would then go and handle any service calls that needed to be handled. Once that was done would help load up the truck for the days deliveries and ensure my drivers had all appropriate paperwork for the deliveries and for the truck such as DOT cards and daily checklists. Once they were out I would check up on to ensure was doing as instructed. I then would continue my sales manager duties such as sales calls, pricing the items on the floor, and pulling new product to replace the product that had been sold already. At the end of the day i would do the deposit and count the money in each drawer with help of the accounts team. Lock that in the security room safe and lock down the building for the night."

good,Exciting place to work and coworkers feel like family.  The hardest part of the job is losing people that you have worked with for so long and are like family.  The most enjoyable part is the ability to advance in the company and getting the customer to ownership.
good,"A typical day for me at Aarons was a joy being at work. I learned about furniture sales getting to know your customers and making them feel comfortable with what they purchased (A Good Sales Woman). My management team and my co-workers were very delightful, sweet, and kind hearted people whom I enjoyed being around every day. The hardest part about the job is not getting to know all the marketing and the potential that store has to offer. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was allowed to be myself and show my personality to each and every person that came through the door which made the job exciting."
good,"I was hired at Aaron's, Picayune, MS. , a little over a year ago. I have to say, I ABSOLUTELY love it !! I came in not knowing anyone, and with very little retail / Lease to own knowledge.

good,"I worked my way up from CSR to sales manager in 6 months. I was a consistent top seller and thrived when faced with a challenge. I luckily had a CAA and a GM willing to show me the correct way to do something without fear that it was ""too much"" or ""too hard to learn"" or that they were ""showing me too much at one time"". I definitely will miss them and their false confidence that I knew what I was doing when 89% of the time I was all the way winging it.  It's about advocating for the customers and treating them as the number one priority,  maintaining organization, and consistently closing sales by listening and identifying needs (features)  as well as the wants (benefits)."

I started as a Customer Service Rep with no experience and moved up to General Manager within the 4 years I was with the company. Even when I was a lowly little CSR my Regional Manager took notice in the work I did and coached me into promotion after promotion. It came with a lot of hard work, dedication, and training, but he at least took the time to make sure I was given every opportunity to move up in the company if I wanted to. And I saw this with every other employee too. They have excellent training programs that really give you the tools to move into management positions and really climb the corporate ladder. They always look to promote from within and I really like that because you can really build a lifelong career. And of course I wanted to!

good,I work for Aaron’s because of the many opportunties it provides and the stability. Prior to working here I had never heard of  Aaron’s. After 7 months there is still something new to be learned each day. It makes me happy to work here. I am here to serve the customer and help them to ownership. I value the chance to meet new people and help them in any way possible. Not everyone can go to certain places and do business there. That’s where we come in. The difference is our service. Aaron’s provides a chance to all of its employees to “own” their position. Not many places do that. It means I have the ability to go as far as I want to. Aaron’s makes you feel as though you are connected to something bigger than yourself and that you matter. Everyday is different. Everyday provides new opportunities. What I do matters.I like the associates I work with & their dedication and upper management allows you to think outside the box & seeks associate feedback.
