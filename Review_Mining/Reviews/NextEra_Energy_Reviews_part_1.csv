rating,review
bad,Get blamed for everything and expected to kow tow to the culture there.  Get immediately scrutinized to the point that you feel uncomfortable to do the work.
bad,"So I'm a contractor at NEE but work in Cybersecurity like an employee. I have never worked for a manager so controlling, micromanaged, berating, insulting, and overall mean, unpleasant, unfair and horrible to others in my life as here. In the last 6 months 3 people left without having found another job and two others who did find new jobs first, for a 60% turnover in staff in 6 months about. The only reason I stay is because I have an adult child that needs me to care for him due some mental illness. If I was on my own I would walk out the door tomorrow. I search every day for a new job. I have been working for over 40 years, and as I approach 62 this man demands I fill out a daily activity log to account for ever minute I work, treating me like a child because Im in another office and he needs to control every minute of my day. Anyway, in 40 plus years of working for all kinds of people, some very good and others not so much and having been a manager of people in a few past jobs myself, this guy is light years ahead of anyone for being the worst person to ever manage people EVER, whom Ive come across and has no right being in charge of people. The fact that NEE allows this type of person to manage 9 to 10 people (depending on who quits this week) means that it's a company willing to tolerate extraordinarily poor managers or they are out of touch with how badd things are. Either way I will not and can not support working for a company that condones the mis treatment of staff."
bad,Solar site completed management staff has moved on to other locations.  Not the best place I've ever worked.  I would not recommend me saying anything additional since I was not happy there.
bad,"NextEra is quite open about its lack of concern for its employees. Expect to figure things out, with very little training or support. Employees appear unhappy for a reason. Pay is quite lower than industry average, and employees are viewed as dispensable by management. Bullying by fellow employees and management is quite common."
bad,"The Managers priorities were not about the skills the person has for the job, but for her insecurities.  This did not change despite the fact that their department lost a lot of money.  She verbalized that she hates skinny women."
bad,"excessive stress and nothing much to learn. "
bad,They were not interested in fixing wind turbines all they cared about was do temporary fixes  keeping there production numbers up  You don't fix things with glue and zip ties when comes to any mechanical issues !!!    I have been to other sites  all over the USA and yes they run there sites the same way.  I will never work for them again!
bad,"Good-old boy, buddy system. No one to speak your concerns with, all are friends and cover up for each others mistakes. Unfair treatment within the company. No room for career advancement, wrong people in key slots."
bad,"Huge turnover in management, unprofessional, no raise the entire time I was there, stressful.  No work/life balance, constantly worked long days and most weekends."
bad,"Went to an interview on Wed and actually stayed there for over 4 hours only to be emailed today that I wasn't selected for a $12 an hour position as a customer service Rep. I'm okay with that but the review is being written because this was the worst, most unprofessional interviewing process I have ever encountered. To take 4 hrs and 45 mins to interview for this particular position was an absolute waste of time. There was no organization when it came to the face to face interview. After seeing this and receiving the email today, I'm glad I dodged the bullet. To feel that its okay to keep people in an interview that long is inconsiderate and once again , profusely unprofessional."
bad,Interesting place to work.  Would need a tête-à-tête to discuss NextEra.
bad,Very hard to work for. Pay is horrible for field. They will find a way to screw you out of bouns and find a way to give you raise to a buddy. This is the good ol boy program!
bad,"I have nothing more to say. They are a horrible company to work for, that's why I jumped ship"
bad,How do you say this company experience was a political minefield Good luck notice all the above feedback came from former employees
bad,"People are leaving HR and no one is doing anything about it. They expect you to keep taking on more and do not care how many hours you work. They want to do your job and take on more and more ""special projects"" without additional compensation. The special projects never end so you really are doing 2-3 jobs at a time ALL THE TIME. If you want any sort of balance in your life or if you have a family DO NOT work here. "
bad,If you are over 50 need not to apply. You will not find anyone over 40 and need to know someone to be hired. They have a revolving door policy and are constantly hiring.
bad,"This is are fairly large company with quite a few departments and it is night and day across some of them.  (Non Nuclear) Specifically has abusive VPs and Managers. Having a long run here 20+ years to date and seeing the issues. I would not recommend a child or friend employment here. This is old school management mixed with a military influence. This department is grossly understaffed and underfunded and other departments are being asked to replicate this departments leadership. I have seen employees unfairly treated when they are no longer desired in an effort to get them to leave. Many have gotten sick, disabled or a few passed away later through health issues. There is very very little training in general and no effective training for management. Managers have been promoted to learn on the job causing arrays of problems from equipment and reliability to safety and personnel issues. This company plays the game better than any I have seen. They preach Work life balance, take charge of your career, employee engagement etc... but in reality its who you know and if your boss really likes you. Instead of asking people to change positions or maybe look for other employment they lie to you and document against you by setting you up to fail. Since the processes are weak and under developed its not hard to document minor gaps to terminate you as they are 'honestly' trying to improve you. There have been so many lawsuits but the company's excellent legal team sweeps them under the rug through settlements and gag orders. Now the CEO has a goal to be the number one Power Company in the"
bad,"Palo Iowa. The pay is good and overtime is mandatory. Work life balance is poor. The worst part of working there, are the managers. The security supervisor and manager have created a toxic environment. They will discipline and write people up for the dumbest things. The managers may be corrupt, they have been investigated by the FBI several times.. On top of all that the plant is closing next year so it’s a dead end end."
bad,"Hard place to work.  Challenging work environment due to just the nature of the industry,, the computer systems, constant auditors and then there are not many friendly people.  Good money.  Long hours.  But not a nice place to work."
bad,Some bad managers that are toxic. The competetive environment has produced a lot of back biting of high performing employees. Also the technical knowledge in some of the groups is very poor.
bad,Must shake the right hands. Only friends of management move up and get paid more. If they want you fired they will get you fired.
bad,"The women in management are TERRIBLE and ill-qualified. If they feel threatened, you will be forced to work in a hostile work environment and blacklisted from the entire company."
bad,FPL will fire any employee if they do not recover from an injury 100% even if it is there fault. They have created a 100% disposable work force within their company. 
bad,"Never would have believed it.  They were so persuasive in the interview process, but, it was so disappointing that they were just trying to sell me."
bad,"I worked at Next-Era-PBNP for ~10 years in the Chemistry Group. When on call, fine. But when others on call, I was called instead-hard to think clearly when called at 2:00-3:00 am Monday mornings. Many times when called, just told OPS I'll be in for work in 15 minutes. Then you spend your whole 8-10 hour shift at Next Era-PBNP with no overtime compensation. The people I worked with were great in OPS, Maintenance and HP. But if you weren't part of the ""good old boys club in Upper Management"", you were left out in the cold. Summation - all the worker bees, lower and middle management people were great. Upper Management really requires ""readjustments"".Also WAY TOO MANY PROCEDURES!"
bad,"They actually repremand you as if you are a child and punishes you based on feed back from calling back disgruntled customers. They do not allow us to help the customers by limiting us, then you get written up if the customer calls back to say they did not get what they wanted. They also always threaten to replace you based on calls they monitor and based on customer surveys they do.  Their customers are never happy and you have to pay for it in customer Service."
bad,"Arrogant management acting with impunity.  The specific jobs are great, and the benefits and pay are outstanding, but the management oppression and arrogance are unreal."
bad,"I loved my job and I took it very seriously, although I was treated unfairly at times along with other co-workers of mine who left under unfair circumstances."
bad,"This is not a good company to work for if you are interested in advancement. FPL is a company to work for when you are in between a job. The pay is low, benefits are terrible from insurance being high and not worth it to the 401K being almost worthless."
bad,"Cannot advancement unless you're in the manager's back pocket.  Company gets on Forbes ""Most Admired"" company list all years, but there is a team to lie for company who write up the info to turn in to Forbes. At no time a team comes out to the field to get the real pulse of the company. Management, including HR lies to employees.  They just tell you enough to keep you off of their backs."
bad,"FPL pays good and there is room for growing in the company if you are able to stand the cold. You have to put on so much gear,  when its time to go on break, you miss it because you are still taking of gear. ( vest plate , gloves etc.)"
bad,Nextera would be a good company to work for but it lacks in its traning and some of the people there are very rude. I think that they could have a lesson in training
bad,"Even though the application process was rigorous, to elect the best candidates. The career path was vague . You have to earn full-time status and without definite parameters that can take forever. Also your supervisor was constantly changing so any rapport or working relationship you build is lost."
bad,"Nepotism is a huge problem here.  Unqualified, inexperience and without proper education is rampant for Full Time employees.  They will hire contractors to do the work they can't, or won't or don't want to do, while treating contractors with education and experience as a second thought.  Will take credit for work and quick to blame.  Work pace is slow when dealing with the business.  Wouldn't recommend if you are about performance, good morals and ethics.  IF you are lazy and want job security go for it."
bad,"FPL has really decreased how much they value their employees over the last couple decades. Management is horrible.  No room to advance if you're not related to someone in upper management,  they expect their representatives to be verbally abused from the customers , most of their programs offered are scams. The worst work environment I've ever been apart of and regret my time there. Dont apply to this company unless you are a student for FIU and need a stepping stone for your resume."
bad,"Great opportunity for young, inexperienced, technicians; experienced and knowledgeable technicians should seek employment elsewhere. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the site I worked at was a high revenue site safety was constantly ignored and the hostile environment only caused that to become a constant proving ground for speed contests. Any serious injuries will most likely lead to termination or you being forced to resign. Corporate is constantly hypocritical about how jobs should be performed  and micromanagement is the new Corporate strategy."
bad,Does not have much care for employee satisfaction or training or mentorship.  You need to have the skills and experience before coming to this company.
bad,"The pay and benefits are great for the area and plenty of time off. The Jobs are great and the safety culture theory is top notch. Organization, being fair and care for employees could use some work."
bad,Florida Power and Light located & headquartered in Southeastern Florida Provides electric service to majority of the state; including some of southwest Florida.
bad,"I give the company A rating of 2 . They are not people friendly. At times you get overworked , benefits are good. There is no job certainty at NEXTERA Energy  Forney."
bad,My day was never the same I did something different every day
bad,"The IT group is using out of date ERP software and they export data to local spreadsheets and db's to get what they need.  Quite a bit of pressure to make due with the ERP limitations, but to provide a current level of support. Lots of politics being played at the middle management level that upper management seems oblivious to."
bad,"Not the best experience, but it had to do with the division I worked in. Direct supervisor very difficult to work for. Very stressful environment to work in."
bad,"There is no on boarding process for new hires, with many land minds to navigate on your own is risky as there are many Job ending mistakes that are often made.  "
bad,"High turnover rate because of the low pay and hard work, management treats production employees bad."
bad,"Just a job,people curse alot..management do not evaluate the worker"
bad,"Politics are over people, many power figths that affect work environment.  Not all the options to grow up where available due to the naive positions in the management.  Not a good experience."
bad,"There is such a focus on cutting costs that it becomes detrimental to a teams ability to deliver a quality product consistently. Teams are spread so thin that there is not much potential to scale, inhibiting long term value creation for shareholders outside of M&A activities."
bad,The job there was pretty flexible and interesting.  The culture and environment is not too bad either.  The people are quite nice.  It's just a workplace.  I didn't hate it or loved it.
bad,Supervisors care more about spending more time in the office than effectively completing work. The culture of this organization is downright depressing and is prevalent throughout all locations.
bad,"No job security. Management does not have your back. Co-workers are good people to work with, but poor management.  Hardest part of the job is the paper work that is required without an time allotted to complete it in the work day."
bad,Training and support for oil and gas business was a mess. Many setup errors throughout system training.  Not an employee oriented division of Nextera.  Just a number.
bad,I worked for nearly 20 years for fpl and I must say that overall crews get along great but it always seemed to fall on the crews shoulders to clear obsticles rather than just showing up and in a productive manner performing your job
bad,"As a mid-level manager, you spend most of the day trying to get past  office and inter-departmental politics and not enough time actually getting work done.  Alot of bullying occurs, with people pulling rank to   advance their agendas.  This is a recent development with 'Project Momentum' this year - it is destroying the company, and they intend to do it annually."
bad,"ok when you get the job, very hard to move. I would tell people to think hard before they take a job here, only energy company in /florida"
bad,Monitor the network and react to outages in a timely manner to assure due diligence
bad,"A typical day involves working on several projects and dealing with whatever priority arises either through a ""fire"" or a random request from management."
bad,"Poorly managed, no direction, No communication, Very Cut throat. "
bad,"The position required operations background which I had none.  I was told I would be able to attend BWR Fundamentals training after being out of the nuclear industry for over 12 years.  My manager assigned a mentor who was willing to allow me to fail saying, ""it is the only way you are going to learn.""  After requesting a new mentor, I was pulled out of the BWR Fundamentals course.  I was then put on a performance improvement plan which the manager kept changing each review period without acknowledging past improvements."
bad,"The company requires your complete dedication to work with no work life balance.  In fact, they refer to it as life management rather than work life balance.  Expect a minimum of 50 to 60 hours workweek."
bad,"Everyone is out for themselves, management is weak, and training is terrible. They'll judge you on how fast you complete training with low speed/low quality internet connection. Forklift training was a joke, everybody got a ""good enough"" with bare minimum training which contridicts their safety 1st policy. NextEra Energy in itself seems like a nice company to work for however this particular location needs improvement."
bad,"Experience very much depends on department in which you work, and whom you report to. Some areas are more cut throat and competitive than others. Benefits are great, beautiful working environment."
bad,Work life balance sucks. Pay is not horrible. Frequent changes in management make the corporate environment every changing from normal to stressful and unbearable.
bad,"If you are looking for long term employment, look elsewhere.  Company likes to reorganize and reduce employees every few years.  Few places to move up in the company."
bad,"Overworked, understaffed, poor management in regards to employee concerns, long hours required, overtime no issue to get, pay is good, but no home life, lot of disgruntled employees,"
bad,"Good place to work. Small chances for advancement, good salary, good benefits and vacation. Some people can be hard to work with, but it can be a mostly independent work flow."
bad,None of the company lives by the company shared values.  Many things are said just to make the company look like something it is not.  I would not recommend working for them if you believe in doing the right thing always then it is not for you.
bad,"Workplace culture-small environment, long hours"
bad,"Continual changing management with varied expectations for each group that comes in. "
good,"Teams are well organized, and led - but there is a bit of siloism across the organization, which can be expected with an organizaiton this large.  Pay is not great, and there is little commitment to development.  The recent group of high potentials (13 in total) only had 2 women."
good,"No advancement for many.  There is a real lack of leadership at the lower levels. Everyone is out for themselves. Managers are scared to death to make any errors and will blame staff for their mistakes.  Not a good environment for most.  If you happen to be liked, you will be fast tracked-  Good luck with that.  Most never get the opportunities."
good,Every day was a different job not too much advancement in a company and allow the higher up or they were better than anyone else.. management or higher-ups would make sure not to teach the up-and-coming anything new because there be a risk of them taking over the position
good,"Management is garbage and most know we aren't paid well for it, only in overtime does it become worth it, and they are lowering that to. Terrible work life balance is the new way of life. Used to be a great company with managers who cared, then literally 4 chains in my command jumped ship and it all started going down hill. Very sad how far it's fallen. Those 4 chains in my command and over a dozen have quit since. It's apparent why."
good,NextEra continuously changes the management teams. Our new General Manager did not care to meet us nor request our input prior to making direct decisions impacting my team.
good,"Company only hires interns for the summer, so start as a freshman and you will get hired when you graduate college, but only for the summer"
good,"FPL does an amazing job of training its employees! Its also one of the best in its industry to work for and working for them will add a lot of value to your resume! I enjoy the ""friends and family"" culture. However, FPL does a poor job of developing clear career paths for employees.  professional development is very muddy and can often be put on the back-burner. Also, salaries here are WAY lower and FPL does not pay market value for employees.  They also don't clearly define roles.  This is the cause of a lot of employee engagement concerns for employees."
good,Regardless of performance rating - if you are deemed highly compensated - you are a target for layoff because cost drives short term decisions.  Very political environment.   Keep your mouth shut and head down if you have any objections to senior leadership.   Minorities are protected class. Good luck if you are middle age white male.  If you are paid considerably higher than your peers - you are a potential target for layoff.
good,"This company can be good or bad depending on where you are placed. If you are placed in Juno Beach (HQ) it can be beneficial for you. But if you are placed in places like Iowa like I was, it was a whole different world out there. Poor management, crafty people and a very selfish work environment.  Every person looks out only for themselves."
good,"This company is in the midst of major change due to the unstable oil prices.  The cost saving measures they are attempting to put in place involve eliminating too many positions, to the point that they are severally short staffed."
good,Lots of traveling to do maintenance on GE 1.5 Wind turbines.
good,"FPL is a great company to work as a stepping stone. Professional growth and competitive pay should not be expected as is the norm for IT positions in Miami."
good,"There was basically no support for contractors working for NextEra from the parent company Health Fitness. Health Fitness has a policy that hires people for as low as they can, does not give overtime, and does not invest in your professional development."
good,"It has become increasingly contractor heavy, If your mindset is 2 years and move on it might be a good fit. Just watch out for Accelerate/Momentum/Digital Transformation."
good,Not a bad place to work. I was contracted thru The Spear Group. Not really sure if they know how to manage people. After 4 years I was fired. I had been with the Spear Group of and on for 21 years.
good,Management moving jobs overseas.  Company is moving farther away from the personal touch.  Employees are just a number.  Company is requiring more employees to move to corporate location.
good,"Is an excellent company if you get in good hands."
good,Work was fairly good.  2 to 3 towers climbed most days. Co- workers were good but management poor and would not stand up to corporate for employees. Over turn high.
good,A typical day was centered around consulting with the different business units in the organization to help them map out Root Causes for incidents within the department.  Act as a corporate reference to answer and guide business units in Federal and State Standards as they apply to the organization.
good,"Co-workers didn't get along with each other.  As a new-be, I was taken aback by superiors who cussed at me repeatedly over a period of months.  Local management was not supportive but punitive. Management in Juno were supportive to some degree.  4 people out of 8 lost their job or quit in response to local management and the environment at the job site."
good,"•	Responsible for addressing customer inquiries in a timely and professional manner"
good,"My co-workers are great to work with and I interact with many workers from different area of the company. I have a great working relationship with my coworkers. I get a long with all co-workers, supervisors, & managers."
good,"Nextera Energy is an excellent Fortune 200 company that operates in the Utility space. It is well managed and is recognized as an industry leader. The compensation is very competitive and the benefits are comparable to any company of its size."
good,I had a great time working that it was a great experience I learned a few more things that I didn't know and it was an honor for me working for nextera
good,"Management is inept, work/ life balance is non-existent. The Salary is average but benefits are terrible. The hardest part is trying to get your job done, with all the lack of communication and constant micromanaging."
good,Upper management does not know what is going on in the field. Then management wants to make dissensions on what to do and how. Upper management is always changing with no idea on what to do.
good,"Large corporation, that does not care about it's employees on a personal level or professional development. Not a people oriented workplace. Work expectations are to work your normal hours and then any and all hours required based on the needs of the company. Compensation for extra hours is not provided as a rule. "
good,Huge electrical utility conglomerate where many employees spend a lifetime.  Not uncommon to find employees that started in their teens and are now at retirement age retire with million in their 401K.
good,"leaving because of horrible boss, workplace culture is OK, but the overall culture in HR is terrible due to a few tyrannical female bosses the turnover is very high"
good,"Within the program I worked, there was a very obvious need for process development and training.  This would help with productivity."
good,"The work location was not very desirable. I also found that discipline at FPL as well as mutual respect between co-workers as well as diversity was lacking, with a lot of favoritism."
good,Too much work and not enough support staff. The company focuses more on the shareholder than personnel.  There is a lot of good ol’ boy attitude there as well.
good,"I enjoy the culture and co-workers at my specific job location, however given industry terns, my position is no longer stable. If I were willing to relocate to corporate offices, I would continue to work for this organization."
good,"I learned troubleshooting AC/DC circuits and motors. Although they said they regarded safety as a top priority their work schedule and worker input about unsafe procedures and workers was not taken seriously."
good,"excellent people, great location, opportunities abound. Culture is emerging as budget focused and tends to lack teamwork. Require a significant amount of commitment and significant amount of uncompensated overtime."
good,"Check your emails and there will be plenty. Check on data, deadlines, items marked URGENT - Prioritize"
good,"Because this job was temporary i did not get all the experience it had to offer,however, i found it to be a great place to work"
good,"Since this was a short term contract and required a great deal of effort the life balance was poor, the compensation was great for a person who was full time and living there, there was no job security,  the culture was upside-down because this was their first attempt at SharePoint and Project working together.  Management was good and never had anything bad to say about it.  I will never do another short term contract."
good,I would work with upper management to create production targets. Together we would build work plans to achieve these targets. I would assist in major component projects as well as inventory counts.
good,Day to day work varies and always keeps my electrical skills sharp. A motor overhaul may be performed in the morning while trouble shooting complicated electrical systems may be done in the afternoon.
good,"Excellent company with great benefits.  I had a horrible manager who had a terrible reputation throughout the company which made the job challenging.  Work/Life balance sucks, you are basically dedicated to work and have no life.  The work is mentally and physically challenging.  I hear working for different leaders is better and like I said I had a terrible manager.  I left the company for family reasons and honestly am happier because I don't work for the manager I did.  Do not get hurt on the job or they will find any way to ruin your name and push you out the door.  This job is dangerous."
good,Good work place. Great work culture. Very friendly environment. Good learning academy set up. Very friendly client to work with. Good digital transformation.
good,Self employed didn’t like the environment an people were unhelpful an no one was working as a team so I started my own company helping other with there job
good,"Lots of hurry up and wait, the managers were bad at scheduling work weeks, spent half the time fixing their mistakes. The actual work could be redundant at times, but during the outages it was great. Also plenty of overtime to work during outages."
good,It is a fast paced environment with a lot of demands from a lot of different customers/clients.  Work is different everyday.  I enjoy my work there but it is lacking in work-life balance.
good,"This job was decent. I didn't not like working the schedule because going from days to nights ends up feeling like I was always tired. Also, this shift made it difficult to see my family"
good,Had a good time working there good ppl work was steady supervisor was good would help out on anything you were working on. I would work there again if i had a chance.
good,"An employee typically is able to work on a schedule or develop their work assignments.  An employee can also schedule and attend meetings.  There are also all hands meetings to discuss the status of the overall company,"
good,Group health insurance offered by Nextera was very expensive. It is also a deductible plan and not a copay plan. Was not expecting such a large profitable company to have insurance so expensive.
good,"Very pleased to work here , I liked the one on one with my boss. He was very easy going and always was very understanding. He helped me learn the process of claims department. I learned a lot about Fpl and I would do it again if I had the opportunity."
good,"I am glad for the opportunity to work for this company. Being an employee allowed me to help both my children go to college.  I was also able to earned my Bachelor's degree.  Unfortunately, the workplace values are often spoken, but loosely followed."
good,"I only worked here as a Internship program through Miami Dade Collage. It was only a month, But I did get paid and that was helpful since I was paying for school"
good,"Pay and benefits are good.  It is a environment built on regulations so if you enjoy following stringent rules and are a perfectionist, this may be a good place for you to work."
good,The company is undergoing major reconstruction. Letting go many employees and offering early retirment. Managers and supervisors are being reduced as well.
good,"Company does interesting energy work, and senior management is great.  Middle management is terrible and very young with many lessons to learn.  I like the company, but didn't respect middle management."
good,Many very long-term employees who are passionate about the company they work for. Lots of employee programs and incentives. Very corporate lifestyle. Nice people.
good,"Competitive, smart people with rotational opportunities.  Wind, solar, storage, gas, regulated, unregulation, accounting, project development, treasury, credit, engineering and construction, risk management, legal, valuation"
good,Practice what you preach. That is not what happens here. There is a total disconnect between upper management and the workers in the field. I am at a level about half between those two levels and I witness what happens at both ends. And no one will change the culture. Too many obstacles and barriers in the system.
good,FPL taught me a lot about how the things that are consumed are prepared in a safe and USDA compliant manner. This was A GOOD company to work for. Not too many complaints
good,"Great pay, but the company politics can hinder ones ability to advance. Here it is all about who you know and not what you know. However, the pay is good and the benefits are awesome."
good,I gained critical knowledge of systems in the power Industry. I think the safety culture enabled a very positive mindset of all employee's.
good,"It's been many years since I worked there, but I remember a great atmosphere and it was especially fun and hectic during storm threats/ preparation."
good,"Working as a contractor is very stressful. Contractors do all the work while employees attend meetings, go to seminars and shows and attend training classes. They do not treat contractors very well, excluding them from company events and correspondence. Promotions and respect only comes from the length of time worked at NextEra and by merit."
good,"My typical work day included running batch processing, nightly backups and print out production. Management was fair and my co workers were great. I did not enjoy the 13 work day and rotating days of the week. Very hard to plan for events and go to school with that kind of schedule."
good,Your advancement is only limited to how much management likes you.  May hardworking people do not advance unless they become good friends with upper management
good,"The in ability of this Power Company to Keep its Key Maintenance Personnel ( inside bickering and Misuse of power ) has deteriorated the planning ability so badly the Company can not Properly develop a schedule that will allow the Maintenance Management Team to follow the Schedule Plan, and they ultimately fall back to a Stick and Ball form of schedule where Chaos runs rampant, then point fingers at everyone else involved to level a blame elsewhere.It turns out to be a very Stressful Venue."
good,"fun place to work , strict timings , lot of working hours , small team and lot of learning"
good,"Nice place to work and good people. People are good, turnover and under new owners."
good,"processing of food products, not for weak stomach various different sections to work in"
good,I was working in a call center environment but my excellent customer service skills didn't transfer to strictly being on the phone. I greatly appreciated getting a chance to working in FPL call center environment.
good,the company needs at better training program. the community college didn't have the facilities to train
good,was filled with complex meetings with attorneys to meet regulatory and compliance related topics
good,Too much work for one employee. most enjoyable part of the job is independence
good,Wind sites are usually in small towns.  This small town doesn't want new people.  The environment became hostile.  4 out of 10 left in 2 months when the site got a new boss.
good,"Corrido o dia a dia."
good,"liked working at this establishment"
good,"It was overall okay. Didn't feel like my work mattered to leadership but the pay was well for an intern. Very rigid corporate environment, working 8-5 with almost no work from home"
good,"It's a great company to work for, however, it wasn't what I was looking for as a full-time job. The hardest part of working there was that most of the time the customers were the issue. But, the work culture was very united, coworkers were very tight-knit and all were friends."
good,A good company overall with good benefits. Power industry is a dangerous place to work but this company practices one of the best safety cultures I've ever seen.
good,It was difficult to have to make a climb up the wind tower that is 300 ft high.  Some days you'd have to make the climb 2-3 times.  Needed to plan for extreme weather taking plenty of supplies in case needing to spend extended time in the top of the tower.
good,"A typical day at work consist of morning meetings, followed by loading of equipment to complete task for the day. As my job is excellent and would highly recommend I am seeking something closer to home as I drive far too much."
good,"Amazing benefits and many of the business units have a culture of inclusion and diversity.  Just like any big corporation, there were both great leaders and terrible leaders.  They focus on being risk averse and work hard to make smart decisions on investments and asset management.   There is a variety of work place cultures there, and they are direct reflections on the leadership in those units.  There was a ton of opportunity to develop yourself and your skills, as long as there was a business need to do so."
good,"A typical day at work was handling various calls such as connection or disconnection of service, power interruptions, bill inquires. I learned how important listening to the customer concerns were. The customer should be valued and customer satisfaction must be a priority. I learned how critically important it is to be sensitive and compassionate, people do not care how much you know until you show them how much you care for them. Management was fine. The hardest part of the job knowing a person can't pay their bill and having to tell them you cannot grant them a further extension. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people from different parts of the state and knowing that I have completely satisfied the custome.r"
good,"where it all began for me. taken in with little to no knowledge and was given the opportunity to advance and become a lead. this company has provided me with the tools i needed to become a wind turbine technician. in the aspects of learning how to use power tools, rigging, how to handle and check electricity, read schematics, hold presentations, and even become the safety lead for 2 years."
good,"Nice people, but as they move thru upper management, there is a cultural shift to make themselves more important and securing more money."
good,". i liked the work and the pay here was the best but it was constrution work n u push n push your self every day till your worn out . i worked vewry hard got along with everyone the bosses all liked me and always talked about how good of a job i did , but i was ready after 6 yrs to better my education"
good,"Great benefits, decent pay, I found it hard to advance within the company. Job security was not there which was a big negative. Company makes millions of dollars but are very cheap when it comes to certain departments. Management was decent but changed a lot. Co-workers were great."
good,Challenging position.  You wear many hats.  Management is ok.  Co workers are great.  Trying to meet deadlines and constantly having more responsibility added cause considerable stress during reporting periods. But meeting the challange is very satisfying.
good,I called customers collecting debt which I had to differentiate  which customer I could give an extension.
good,Good paying job with a lot of job satisfaction in completing assignments and making a difference in how jobs are done.
good,A great company that looks after their employees. Safety is a Value and not a priority. The Company will purchase any required tools or equipment to keep the team safe.
good,The company has many opportunities for those that can thrive in a very large corporation with the skills that are needed to rise and expand within a very large corporation.
good,"Upper management good, lower level not so much. Lots of favoritism of others. Its a good company, with good benefits. You have to be in the right click, or your unliked."
good,My 4 year run was more than enough experience to understand the changes that have effected the culture of this company. It was in my view that I would eventually be seeking a new environment to build a better foundation for myself.
good,Rarely are people fired. Simple to follow rules. Most people are easy to get along with. Some management are misguided but may listen to subordinates at times.
good,Poor data. Manual processes. Very behind in technology. Difficult to move up. Great group of peers who always went above and beyond to put out fires that came up.
good,Good mid-size company with great benefits and a career starter!
good,"Thing that I like most is that the jobs offers unique flexibility with its job task. One day you may be involved in making boxes, the next day you are grinding meat and so forth. It also was a healthy environment in regards the atmosphere created by fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the unpredictable work schedule. Temperatures can become a nuisance if you are not one who enjoys extremely cold climate."
good,"Great company , great people , cybersecurity teams lacks in the corporate culture. Rude managers in the team, and often don't really care about your effort"
good,"It's a good place to work, fairly good compensation, good benefits. Over the years growth opportunities at the companies have dwindled. Company has been hiring from outside instead of promoting from within"
good,The day starts of with a safety meeting and status of the plant. Then work for the upcoming day is discussed and who will perform what jobs and how to safely complete them. There is not always enough time in the day to complete all the tasks that are assigned. The best part of the job was the core of good coworkers and a manager that supports you.
good,Safety is always number one in all aspects of work and enjoyed working with the crew. The most enjoyable part of any job is the success of job completion. I have learned much about budgets and financials and safety within the company. The hardest part of the job was having the ability to advance to a higher level and was involved with training employees who had less experience.
good,"The work was great. My coworkers were great. Enjoyed my work, and was laid off after years of service."
good,"Good Company, not so good Management.  Managers lied to your face and hung you out to dry while co workers did not help, there was no sense of teamwork or helping out less experienced people."
good,"safety meeting "
good,Working with juveniles yet the salary does not match the responsibilities.  Improvement needed with the type of services needed to help this population
good,"Big corporation reducing every year its employee benefits. There are a lot of good individuals in this company, that's what make this company great and very profitable."
good,"If, as a contractor, you can come in and do the job, with no benefits at all, you are the ideal candidate. Everyone walks around while looking over their shoulder, don't talk too much to the same people. "
good,what can I say I only worked there a tear it was only temp the staff and collectors was very kind to us all and the work very easy no problems at all it was a ok job
good,NEXTera is the fastest growing company I ever worked for. The company has deep resources to fuel its appetite for growth. Promotion is a challenge uuless you work in the corporate headquarters.
good,some organizations is run by VP that has no clue in details what is going on in the background and certainly some senior managements do take advantage of that. 
good,"I had a great time and learned plenty of new things form good people. Very poor management, however. The culture within the group was good, and teamwork and safety were always paramount."
good,"Was challenging, and informative. Expanded knowledge of Human-relations, and business administration. Was a HUGE customer-base, that presented an unlimited amount of Customer Service-issues. Rewarding at-times, frustrating at-others. Lack of advancement."
good,"Large Corporation and opportunities for several people."
good,"Climb towers, replace components. Plenty of on-the-job training. Excellent co-workers. Quality of management depends on location."
good,"WindLogics was a decent place to work, while I was there they were in a state of transition between being a small start-up company and being purchased by FPL. I experienced all the rough edges that occur it this type of transition, so I am not sure that I can give a fair review."
good,"Work Life Balance: This industry requires long hours and around the clock support. Working weekends, holidays, nights, etc. are very normal. "
good,"NextEra Energy proved excellent benefits. Specifically in the area of vacation and on-site groups and activities (strictly at the main office)."
good,"Work days are long and can be quite challenging, but the company rewards well for good work. Very diverse workforce.  Company management strives to enforce core values across-the-board (Commitment to Excellence; Do the Right Thing; Treating People with Respect)."
good,NextEra is sometimes fun when one can get attention and approvals from management. A typical day at work requires spending a lot of time and energy trying to drown out all the noise in the open office environment. I learned that it is important to not expect to be appreciated by anyone. Management and the culture is about self promotion. The hardest part of the job is convincing yourself that what you do matters. The most enjoyable part of the job is the turtles.
good,This company is the leader in the wind turbine industry. The infrastructure supporting the Operations & Maintenance Team is extraordinary.
good,From my experience at FP&L the company itself would have been excellent to work for as a full time employee however I was hired through an agency and when the company decided to layoff some of its employees I was one of the first to get the boot.
good,Took this job because I wanted to stop traveling. The company is great to work for. There is not a lot of opportunities close to where I live in Oklahoma city
good,"Leads the power generation and distribution when measured by the mechanics of the industry. Many outsiders are impressed when you tell them you work for NEE, however, the culture has not evolved since the sixties and feels militaristic with:strict dress codes including clothing types, styles and colors, hair styles; jeans and sneakers prohibited always. Nothing special about company benefits. Managment style is  enforced hierarchy with significant salary and perk gaps between management and staff. Being headquarters is in Florida (paradise)  salaries are notorisly low. "
good,"NextEra Energy previously named as Florida Power & Light (FPL) provides electric power in Florida. Worked as an engineer in a power producing nuclear plant.  Through my tenure, I saw various management styles which all attempted to improve the company. NextEra Energy is a good company to work for..........I took an early retirement to experience other opportunities."
good,"I worked at FPL as a PNC engineer in Miami Dade area and this was the most supporting, knowledgeable, and positive group of people I ever worked with."
good,If you are interested in the utility industry this is the company to work for because they are growing every day and working heavily in alternative energy space.
good,"Pros"
good,High intensity work place with intense focus on meeting financial objectives. Company environment is supporting and rewarding.  Legal department is expected to be hands-on.
good,"ambiente de trabajo divertido, tiene buenas conductas para dirigir al personal, dan training al personal los empleados sonamables"
good,No Thanks I don't feel like giving a review about my job at FP&L.  It was a good job while it lasted and they paid well after being there for 20 plus years.
good,company has many opportunities for advancement.  The company is a SP 200 with field sites across United States and Canada for solar and wind. To advance you might need to relocate.
good,Florida Power was a good place to work as a contractor.  I was actually a contractor for Metro Information Services until Florida Power was sold to Duke Energy and Metro was sold to Keene
good,Overall a good company. They offer great benefits but opportunities and options for work-life-balance and growth between bussiness unit are not the same.
good,"goos pay and plenty of overtime, corporate is rather full of themselves and not afraid to let you know how wonderful they are."
good,"Usual accounting processes; a/r, a/p, general ledger, month/quarter/year end reporting.  Management team was located states away, which sometimes was difficult.  Learned budgeting for a major corporation."
good,"Clearly structured environment, Fast paced work."
good,was able to work on my own and complete my work without being micromanaged.. Felt good about myself doing my work individually.
good,Corporate management lacks compassion and any sort of commitment to the employee. There was very little loyalty shown even though they expected it from the employee. I worked very hard for this company but received very little n return.
good,"Great co-workers, still have many friendships with ex- colleagues.  Good benefits and work-life flexibility.  Was also able to have a variety of work experiences."
good,Personally yours is a temporary employment agency so I would do be at different locations at times and being able to be at different locations was very interesting. I would meet new people and be in different types of enviroments
good,There is something about being 150 ft in the air working with your partner.
good,"For a first time outage employee I have learned a lot working for FPL at the M&T E Cal lab, from the ""home boy"" employees to the contractors I learned a great deal regarding the Nuclear world."
good,I work from 8-5 handling incoming calls. I've learned a lot during my 9year time at FPL.
good,"The company culture is very good. They believe in doing the right thing, customer satisfaction and community involvement."
good,"Fast pace working environment , Traveling position, Basic electrical and hydraulic knowledge, Many company benefits, Crane and rigging knowledge, Rescue training."
good,I like what I do at NextEra energy but I’m always looking to advance my skill whether it be in the Wind Turbine business or another field. I would suggest NextEra to anyone looking to get into working on wind turbines due to their compassion for employees and their drive to be the best at what they do.
good,"Good -  excellent benefits, very competitive for a fortune 200 company.  Large corporation so you’re able to attain a wealth of knowledge  within the various departments"
good,"The culture is vey much geared towards advancement and recognition in most areas, however there are blind spots that management does not see and that can be very stressful."
good,"Overall, a strong company with intelligent employees. Provides an opportunity to work on complex, legal matters. Provides a strong compensation package."
good,FPL was a great company to work for but like any corporate employer as they grow you too must grow or for sure be left behindin your cubicle in corporate funk.
good,"Good company, management style differs per department.  Job culture is okay depending on location. Ideas tend to be streamlined and assigned to others which does not foster room for employees to make suggestions resulting in little to no participation and unjust recognition."
good,"Outstanding company."
good,"Overall great company to work for. Some groups are better than others, and you need to find the right fit. They take great care of their employees and their families."
good,"When I first started at FPL, I had a wonderful manager and team, but within a year, management decided to restructure and since then; it's been a constant thing. They are constantly changing the organization, but not the people. So very little career advancement. There's no career path for most people. Only the chosen ones receive the better projects. "
good,"Great work culture, travelling for training. Fun place if you happen to be mid-west locations. Company's participate in great benefit- 401K, health, dental and vision care."
good,"Great company to work for! Great benefits. Lots of vacation, and paid holidays. Co-workers were team player, and safety was top priority."
good,"NextEra Energy is a strong company with a range of ownership across the United States. They are one of the major players when it comes to clean energy and providing competitive electricity at the lowest cost possible. Very professional work environment. The company struggles to be proactive at times and works best in a near-continuous 'crisis management' mode. Staff reductions have some Regulators concerned about the safe operation at some power plants. The age of some plants is also a concern for long term employment. Strong loyalty is preferred over personal integrity in some instances. If people work hard and do the right thing, that is sufficient and expected. Overall a very safe company to work for but they have to survive a tough electrical power provider and utilities environment with significant competition from Excelon and Dominion."
good,"There was a huge workload, and incredible opportunities for expanding knowledge and experience, but very little opportunity for advancement."
good,FP&L executive management lacked the necessary goals and incentives to make a significant improvement in employee performance!
good,A great place to work for your entire career. unfortunate there are no exit opportunities in the local area.
good,"Good company to work for, advancement opportunities are vast.  Employee benefits could be better."
good,"I believe that NEE is a good company that is well positioned for the future. They have spent years implementing the six sigma quality principals to document and standardize processes, which has contributed to the success of the company."
good,"A pleasure being a Supervisor with this workforce. Drive and desire are some of their great characteristics and make my job much easier."
good,"they offer alot, but demand alot. its always full of young newcomers that stay for a year or two on and off during the year so there are always fresh faces, full of questions! Cafeteria and gym in the building is a plus."
good,"Solidly run, stable place to work with opportunities in many fields and and professions. Some cutting edge technology and ideas, and strong community involvement."
good,"I've never been involved in a wind farm project before, so this was an extremely interesting job for as long as it lasted. It was an extremely challenging project experience due to the weather we experienced during construction"
good,"* Except for emergencies, you can plan, schedule, and execute work on your own schedule."
good,It is a nice place to work. There are many training opportunities. CEO is smart and communicate with employees a lot. Working schedule is flexible. Company provides many discounts and location is good.
good,it is a lovely place to work. a professional safe environment. in a secure business market. a great place to learn and grow in what ever capacity you may hold
good,Excellent company to work for. The company encourages employees to have questioning attitude. Cross-teams are created to avoid silos. Management continuously emphasized the importance of safety.
good,"- Daily work consisted of a morning briefing of all planned jobs for the day and how they would be executed safely with minimal impact to production."
good,Easy burn out here as work life balance is talked about a lot but hard to act on when fewer people are involved in the daily activities. Great benefits and compensation and management create great shareholder value.
good,"It is all dependent on where you work, what are you long term goals and interests. Great opportunities in Florida near or inside corporate headquarters."
good,"No job security. "
good,It was a privilege to work at this highly regarded electric utility.  It was a sad day when the company was merged with another utility and we lost our identity.
good,Middle management has not been truly geared up for leadership in the new economic environment.No true accountability for not performing or reaching goals.
good,"FPL is one of the largest power supply utilities companies in the US. OCS(Outage Consolidation Service)is a Web based application which allows FPL’s customer service representatives to verify service outage. Complaints from customers are received in the form of Trouble Tickets and are stored in the Database. They are assigned to each representative by the Auto-assign feature considering their workload. The representative then verifies the data on each ticket and screens the system via the map viewer. He/she signals all the loops in that area to detect any cuts in the circuit. If he/she detects a cut, he/she forwards the ticket to the emergency contact field engineer to take the necessary action to restore the service"
good,Good company with many extras and benefits that allow the employee to advance.
good,"The schedule might be flexible."
good,"Daily operations in the service planning department involve speaking to contractors and developers to coordinate efforts on new construction projects that range anywhere from single-family homes to entire subdivisions. Commercial developments are also managed by our department. Throughout my time here, I've learned all about the distribution side of construction in relation to power utilities. The people I work with are generally amicable and always willing to help out. Perhaps the most difficult area of the job is the volume of work due to the now expanding construction industry in Fort Lauderdale. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the final product that months of hard work have finally completed."
good,"Florida Power and Light is a very good company overall but in my particular instance, old technology and a drastic change in market conditions put myself and everyone else at the Port Everglades plant in a position to seek other career opportunities both inside and out of FPL"
good,Work/ life Balance is the best thing I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"Processing the NextEra Power Marketing Houston Gas; NextEra Duane Arnold Plant; NextEra Point Beach Plant and NextEra  Seabrook Plant, invoices via SAP Cockpit efficiently and within a timely manner while meeting datelines. Organizing and preparing  non-scan invoices for imaging for Diversified and make sure all are ready for pick up by there due dates. Working closely with NextEra Power Marketing Houston Gas office to ensure all NextEra Power Marketing counterparty gas settlements invoices are paid via ACH, Wires and Checks on a timely manner and accurately. Met guidelines set by the Sarbane Oxley processes invoices processing and payment disbursement procedures. Providing assistance to my peer's as needed. Fully assist with following roles as backup: NextEra Power Marketing counterparty invoices; Payment processing administrator; Payroll invoices. Strongly committed and very determined to take ownership of my job functions. Prepared the funding's for the two Nuclear Sites, these requests twice a week. Ability to give optimal service to the customer. Valuing a good relationship with employee and good communication with upper management and all departments which to work in. Persist and seek out all information before tackling problems in order to complete in a timely manner. Prepared the quarterly report for all Deloitte and Touche's invoices for upper management review. Understand and apply proper procedures and authority to my daily processing and take initiative to ensure invoice approvals have the correct authority level signatures. Since 2006 has taken on additional responsibility"
good,Florida Power & Light is a good company to work for. My work capacity allows me to work with employees within the entire company. I am exposed to a number of different processes that the overall result is to find a way to maximize their software investment and provide business solutions. The hardest part of the job is getting end users to adapt to new things and new challenges. It is a culture change so I have to understand the real business requirements and find the happy medium for those who want to change and those who do not.
good,"Worked independtly, without daily supervision. I learned about the non-regulated, renewable energy industry."
good,"Great company to work for, love the on site gym and cafe'. I had no major issues with this company."
good,"The Company expects total devotion, High demand, high expectation. Company does not suffer fools. at the same time there is a blind worship of senior management. Promotions are rare and people are worked to the breaking point with substandard compensation."
good,"The company itself was great, my manager was really great, I had to leave due to some senior coworkers that were highly stuck in their ways and very uncooperative and very mean outright grumpy sometimes and exaggerate and go around your back instead of talking directly to you. I learned quite alot though new skillsets. If you can put up with the unliking sort on an every day occasion it's a great job I couldn't do it, too many miserable more senior coworkers, but that's with most jobs I suppose."
good,"Depending on the business unit and department, the expectations,work environment and work hours greatly vary. Driving change is difficult and lengthy process."
good,"The oil and gas division is new and was poorly run in the beginning.  Now, they have people in place that know the business and that is making a huge difference.  Sometimes management will do things that doesn't make sense, but that is typically because the parent company has some sort of mandate or the new management team is doing things the way they have always done it (which doesn't mean it's right).  The different divisions live in their own silo's and makes collaboration tough at times.  Overall, I was pleased with the company and the people."
good,"Southern Company sold Gulf Power to NextEra Energy. They have taken us on , but say that there are not enough spots for everyone. It seems like a good place to be if you are one of the lucky few that get to stay on and work for them."
good,"Great place to work. A lot to offer to the employees. Gym, doctors, cafeteria, etc. Some flexibility on the hours depending on the department and the managers."
good,NextEra Energy has great opportunities to acquire new skills and advance your career knowledge. But as any Fortune 500 company they are constantly trying to find ways to make the organizaiton leaner and more profitable. I personally have had great opportunities: however I'm comstantly put into roles that far exceed the scope of my job title. I do belive NextEra compensates employees fairly for their job title just not for the job role they actually perform.
good,Excellent job opportunity in the solar energy field.  Job location could be any where in the USA.  Pay is good and work challenges are excellent. Good work culture.
good,"Good company to work for, if full time and not a contractor the company would take care off you and your needs. but also company is still on old technology."
good,"Working at Point Beach Nuclear Plant for 6 years. It is part of the Florida Power and Light (NextEra Energy) nuclear plant fleet. "
good,I liked most of the supervision and they pay pretty well.  They do expect a lot of overtime from you.  But they try to give you comp time to make up for it.
good,I started at FPL to supplement my income from my primary job due to my recent relocation to FL.  Twenty one years later it became my career and I retired
good,"They encourage Life Balance but some manager do not respect this the policy."
good,"My personal experience has been a great one. I have a stellar manager who looks after his team and reprimands us in the form of additional training, as opposed to public embarrassment."
good,Employees are very willing and able to accomplish tasks.  A lot of room for advancement.  Organization is very hands on and involved.
good,Forward thinking company with a positive culture and growth potential. Pay and benefits are good. Management culture and cost management can make the work environment less enjoyable.
good,"No job security. "
good,Typical day includes handling of business unit needs and general HR issues. The employees of the company are wonderful people and a true pleasure to work for and with.
good,"Many daily task are mundane with little variation. There are many learning opportunities through workshops offered internally and externally. Management has been perceived as under-valuing employees since getting promotions are quite difficult. Co-workers under the same supervisor get along well, but outside of that they are isolated. Communication across departments is weak which makes some projects hard to accomplish. The most enjoyable part is the collaboration on project with direct co-workers."
good,"Working with counterparties to tie out with mw's and pricing. When discrepancies occured, needed to work with the front office (traders) to resolve the discrepancies.  Submitted daily reports via email. Dealt with co-workers on expense reports. Hardest part was meeting deadlines when counterparties wouldn't respond because they didn't have or seem to care about certain deadlines."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Great benefits. Somewhat stressful working environment due to clientele. This job isn't for everyone. However, the company provides you Wellness benefits to help offset any work/life stress. Multiple hiring freezes throughout the company makes advancement somewhat limited."
good,FPL gave me the oppertunities to reach out and experiment with new ideas on how to get Employees to buy into the safety culter.
good,"I enjoy going to work, that pretty much sums it up. I have learned an incredible amount of knowledge with this company and my co-worker are truly friends. The main reason for looking for another job is to move my wife and children closer to family. It is a safe and reliable place to work."
good,I worked for fpl for 27yrs. It was a good experience with good benefits.
good,"FPL offered me the opportunity to grow professionally. I was fortunate to have bosses who gave me a free reign to develop what training programs and delivery systems were best for the company. As a result, my department ranked 'Best in Class.'"
good,"pay is awesome, great benefits"
good,Start the day off picking up your machine which is loaded with your route. Learn to read electric meters from a distance through binoculars. Management and co-workers are almost non existent unless there is a safety issue. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather and dogs. The most enjoyable part of the job is not having a boss always over your shoulder.
good,"Friendly coworkers, fairly good payment and benefits, good place to learn new staff"
good,Excellent staff that can verbalize well to accomplish task at hand. Very diverse with many approaches to decide upon.. It's nice to feel appreciated when things get tough. Management has no problem thanking you for a job well done..
good,"It is a great company overall and that is why I have worked there over 20 years. Work expectation is very high, interesting and demanding which I personally like and look for new challenges.  Training, pay and Benefits are excellent.  My peers are very smart and skilled.  The business unit I support is the most rewarding aspect of the job which is Nuclear generation.   Good, smart, quality oriented people who take safety and performance of their job assignment with most seriousness.   I like the open, honest nuclear culture.  We can call each other out in a professional manner if we have questions and no one in nuclear takes it personally, it is about what is doing the best and safest job for company and the plants."
good,Overall a good place to work. They have a nice culture but they can be really slow to change. So if you are in a technology role this can be frustrating.
good,Good safety culture and work life balance. High expectations of employees but the pay is fair and plenty of room for advancement. I would recomend working for this company
good,Good place to work nice friendly faces easy job and you can work at home one day of the week and weekend off too you could earn up to $25 per hour answering phones and office work
good,"If you like to work on things and get filthy or play with circuit cards and change batteries, this is the job for you.  Promotions are on the individual so there are definite career advancement opportunities.  Personally, I'm tired of working on stuff and it's a bit too electrical for my mechanical aptitude.  Not my cup of tea.  Decent pay and overtime usually available if that's your deal."
good,"All positive feedback. Good Company to work for. Good work environment. Good People, beautiful campus. Better to be employed by the company then to be a contractor."
good,The work environment is mostly relaxed with the occasional hair on fire days that most managers get. It can get hectic at times. Otherwise good people to work with and good pay and benefits.
good,I get to work at 5:30 am clock in at 6am set the floor up with the equipment put my equipment on and wait for the cow to make it to my area and start working i had alot of different jobs that i can do on the line. And i go on
good,"This was a good place work due to the people of course and the culture that developed; this has something to do with the location too, being in Florida helps the culture since going to places and socializing is very common. Management seems to be too focused on makeing the numbers (i understand, it is a business), but some flexibility with the employes could achieve better results."
good,above average company very good people trying very hard to prove for the company a positive outcome .All good with a positive outcome very supportive with a group effort.
good,company strives for great customer experience. There is good pay and benefits . work life balance is a little lacking. There is caring supervision in some spots.
good,The company has changed significantly since I worked there so this review may not be accurate ow. They did a good job promoting from within and we’re constantly training
good,Worked there 10 months. Culture and people were good. Manager was great. Work location and hours were not to my liking which drove my decision to leave
good,A great place to learn about business and get exposure to the work force. Work starts at 730am and ends at 430pm with an hour lunch. Times are flexible per department. Each position is different with different teams solving different problems for the company.
good,"As on overall company, FPL is a great place to work with amazing benefits. However, it is an incredibly difficult place to climb the corporate ladder as they say."
good,not a bad company to work for just worked a lot of hours on a older technology turbine good over time but was working 4 hours from my house and wasn't getting per diem and was offered a job with better hourly wages and per diem couldn't turn it down
good,"Concerned with work/life balance, Great culture, great people. Personnel are more than willing to help you learn and succeed. Great opportunities for advancement."
good,NextEra Energy is a good place to work with a lot of opportunities to advance.  A person that is willing to relocate can advance quickly in the renewable wind and solar business at NEE.
good,It is what you make of it. Good place to work and safety is relatively good. Pay is awesome and within 1 year I had a $5 increase from when I had first started.
good,"Productive  work environment managed Indirect Procurement Contract for Office Products, Print, Furniture."
good,I enjoyed working occasionally at our local power plant and supporting the nuclear engineers. Learned a lot and was challenged to learn. Good employee benefits such as free gym.
good,The company had a defined set of values and culture that helped assimilation to the work environment.  Very helpful co-workers and managers.
good,"Typical day in the job involved visiting 4-5 customer's homes a day to inspect their HVAC system, insulation levels and Duct work."
good,Enjoy working for this company.  There seems to be an endless amount of work but the work is very gratifying.
good,"Challenging and rewarding work. A lot of multitasking. Great business to work for."

When hurricanes have an impact, the work level is stepped up to return customers to service. This is demanding and yet rewarding."
good,"I gained great knowledge working here. As a splunk developer I got a good supporting team and manager who helped me get a good working experience. As a contract employee, its the best place to work."
good,The job growth and learning opportunities at FPL are endless for those who seek them out. The compensation and benefits are hard to compete with in the South Florida market.

good,Fast paced and rewarding.  I learned a great deal about coordinating with different trades to effectively succeed at completing projects.
good,"A typical day is busy doing meaningful in an environment with strong nuclear safety culture.  Management communicates well both vertically and horizontally.

An enjoyable aspect of the experience is an opportunity to see and learn from work done right, i.e. a chance to see the right picture,"

good,"I will not give a pro or con opinion of companies I worked at Seabrook that put food on my family table for 33 years. At the present time the home office is making is making things a little rough "
good,"Good emphasis on safety"
good,Very strenuous job. Definitely gives you insight into how complicated and how much maintenance wind turbines require.
good,Pay is fair and there are opportunities for advancement. They wont hire you for their needs and fire you later. The company understands that you work hard and need a little rest before exerting yourself.
good,"Repairing multimillion dollar equipment was done in a fast pace environment.  Plenty of stress and chances of job injury every day.   35 years of injury free maintenance was a major accomplishment.  Overhauling steam turbines, generators and pumps was a detail orientated job."

good,"Fun, unique, prosperous, and educational. Not very much work/life balance but 2 retirements plans that will have you set for retirement with abundance"

good,The whole staff at Next Era Was great. Really Nice place to work. every one works as a team to complete jobs that need to be done. The training was great.
good,NextEra is a great place to work. There is plenty of room for advancements and the management strongly believes in work life balance. Hours may sound long but day goes by fast. Always lots of work to do. Plant is located 40 miles from most major cities in the high desert off of US Hwy 395 1 mile north of Hwy 58.
good,"Get in at 8 AM, work on the projects that you have, attend meetings, talk to customers and troubleshoot issues, socialize with colleague, perform project updates and demonstrations"

good,"busy, productive, safe, lota paper work , friendly people. i assisted the carpenters in containment building, with build of the scaffold to repair the nuclear plant"
good,"The company is very large.  Staff management is excellent.  In general line management is mediocre to bad, and horribly overworked.  Work life balance is poor.  You have to arrange your own coverage to take vacation.  Cross training is non-existent.  When I went out on a medical leave, my books were a mess when I got back."
good,"I worked here 3 months before i was promoted, it took a couple of months to learn the new position but when i did i gave it my all. When i tried to stand on my owb i was quickly reminded of ny real pisition here and that was behind the men or supervisors on second shift. Lesson learned"
good,"The Managers were helpful, the call volume could be very high during the summer months,and  the customers needing bill extensions.  there was overtime available,"
good,It use to be a good place to work. But it is all about the bottom line. Even though the employees (workers) got the company to be the lowest provider of electricity in the state. Its who you know and not what you know to move up in the company. I loved my job but Supervision and Management made it 10 times harder to do the work than it had to be. I learned that getting the job done safely and being accurate was most important.

good,I was able to learn a ton of information in order to gain the experience and skills to carry onto my next job opportunity
good,They were a very good company to work for. I only have nice things to say about all of my bosses. They really went beyond to made sure we were happy in our work environment. They were even there as guidance and support for me. My co-workers and I developed friendships.
good,great people. good work/life balance. no room for advancement.

good,Awesome company very fast paced and runs lean and they are pushing those limits. Had a great direct manager and an awesome team the vacation buys are awesome.
good,Worked on the turbines. Pretty challenging in cold weather but its worth the money. Nice benefits and PTOs roll over. Excellent place to be with and well balanced.

good,"Fpl brings smiles to the clients and their families. Face painting,  balloon twisting,  characters for visits.  They have you covered.  Company activities such as Christmas party are always part of the year,  as well as get to know you gatherings.  It's like being part of a family working for melody and it was tough to leave."
good,"Met with customers at their residence to investigate the cause of high electric bills.  Instructed customers on electricity consumption utilized by in-house appliances including but not limited to air conditioning, fans, washer and dryer, etc. and the how best to utilize more efficiently. Provided additional information on program availability.  In addition, assisted junior representatives with questions and problem solving in the field."

good,Good Place to work just want to move back near family.  Job advancement available if you are willing to work for it.  I appreciate that aspect.
good,"This company is very good to work for, however as a contract worker there is little expection for long term employment. Overall the pay and work is good."
good,The company is big enough that you can find a niche you are happy with and work in it. Those who do find their niche end up staying with the company for 10= years while others who don't have the patience may end up jumping ship. People who stay with the company find themselves rooted and less likely to move which can be a pro and con.
good,Love to work for this company but management is not always the best.
good,"Walk through Combined Cycle plants water processing systems, from begining to end to detect any potential problems. Alert applicable maintanance and electrical departments of any work requirements and break downs. Collection of water samples for lab testing. Conducted any treatment required as a result of the tests performed."

good,"I find that Nextera pays their employees much better than similar jobs from other companies.  Yes, the work life balance could be better but overall Nextera is a good place to work"
good,"I was hired as a consultant for NextEra and they have a really great work ethic. Their team camaraderie is fantastic. However, their management is overly aggressive in micro managing. There really isn't great autonomy to do your own work in peace and get stuff done. Constant meetings and stand-up calls are not done the true agile way. They extend past the necessary 15-min length often. The culture and the organizational goals at large are really great. I am a huge fan of NextEra but would love to allow some autonomy to their employees."
good,Very Good Company to work with . Work load is moderate and have enough time to learn new technologies . Had Good working culture .Learned lot of new things how to handle the work using different technologies .
good,"In the short time I was with the company, I really enjoyed the people and the culture. There is still a learning curve for the accounting group in the Houston office, but the workplace culture makes up for the temporary struggle."
good,"Enjoyed my tenure as a contractor.  typical work day was meetings to start the day, give an update on your previous days work and any issues that was encountered or any concerns.  The team was a bit short staffed, however, we generally got the job done within the SLAs. Enjoyed working with my team."
good,A typical day was a minimum of 9 hours.  The plant has downsized to the point that current employees are stressed because of the work load and hours they are expected to work.  They also are asked to work an additional 12 hours per 2 week pay period at no additional compensation.  The hardest part of the job is when the utility expects you to work 21 hours in a 24 hour period.  The most enjoyable part of the job is job satisfaction when you solve an issue in the plant but you should not expect site recognition because it is part of your job.
good,Work with a variety of vendors. Fast response repairs and modifications that challenge the team and creates an excellent sense of ownership. Great team efforts.
good,"Quest to work in a professional atmosphere that enables me to come up with the latest and as well as the emerging technologies, thus helping to widen the spectrum of my knowledge."

good,My experience at FP&L was amazing. I loved what I did and the people around me. The company truly cared about their employees and it wasn't always work all the time. Every holiday we would have picnics or potlucks. I got the feeling like I was part of an extended family. I felt like the company was truly family oriented.
good,"As you progress through the ranks, it seems to me and to other people who I worked with that there is a subtle constant push from management to keep you wondering about your job security."
good,"NextEra Energy is a great place to work. The team is extremely knowledgeable and professional. The salary and benefits are also great. The amenities on the campus can’t be beat such as wellness and fitness centers, cafeteria, etc."

good,"Next Era is a great place to work if you understand the structure and are willing to work within it."
good,"Great company, benefits are about industry standard, could be better, could be worse. Great work environment. Safety is king within the company (almost ridiculous) but needed for the type of work and dangers involved in working on/with/around power plant equipment"
good,NextEra is the best renewable energy company in the world.  Everything they do is first class and they strive for continuous improvement at all times.

good,Great experience working with NextEra. The people I work with are all talented. There is always a fair amount of work to do (the outages are very demanding) and you're always afforded the opportunity to challenge yourself and learn more.
good,Great opportunity working with external customers and well as internal customers.   FPL is a great place to work.  Always looking for new talent and new ideas to move the company forward.
good,Great place to work with a lot of benefits. Great culture within. They genuinely care about their employees and the community. They invest in you and your family.
good,"Currently, I have been here nearly three years and have found the people to have integrity and transparency.  I am very impressed with the senior management team."
good,"I started out in a storeroom at Martin Power Plant and last worked at the Central Reclamation and Salvage department in Riviera Beach,Fl."
good,I was a contractor for NextEra Energy.  The employees are great to work with.  The atmosphere was great.  The managers I worked with was great.  I learned a lot from this company.

good,"I was blessed to be able to work with this company.  I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the team. There was always something to learn.  Though at times it was very stressful to make deadlines on submissions.  "
good,"On a typical day you access the condition of the site with turbines requiring repair, wind conditions scheduled service and training obligations.  You plan your day, week, month and year based on a goal of maximizing availability, minimizing cost.  "
good,"I speak with 15-18 customers on a daily basis to assist them in obtaining financial assistance or make payments towards their bills.  I also create the schedule for the next week's accounts, working closely with the Collections department and the Collectors who go to the customers' homes.  The hardest part of the job is when I'm not able to assist the customer due to no funding being available, the customer exhausting all of their options and the services are disconnected.  "
good,I loved working with FPL Nuclear Division. I only left because of a position I was offered that increased my income and promised diversity and a chance to experience more challenges.
good,Worked with a bunch of great men.  Learned many things about energy production.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with a morning plan of the day meeting in which we would discuss daily turbine issues, planned work for preventive maintenances, and any weather or safety concerns for the day or particular work scope.  I have learned vast electrical and PLC troubleshooting skills, computer skills, and implementing corporate values.  My co-workers always look out for each other as we work in teams on every task.  The hardest part of my job is working in the elements as the towers are 300 feet high, subject to the weather.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of a completed project when the entire team had a plan and a goal, in which all goals were met, work was done safely, and effectively."

good,"A typical day would consist of a morning safety and production meeting.  Discussing safety and environmental concerns, discussions on environmental concerns. Review of the previous days production and discussion of current shift production and maintenance.   We would start up the steam turbine from gear, and bring on line.   Depending on operating strategy we may bring the boiler on line as well.   Once on line we would look at PM's and RC's that needed to be completed."
good,A productive and fun workplace with great personal and career growth opportunities. Relocating is a must to move up within the company. Great training programs. Great benefits.

good,One of the best companies around. they do have some flause but im positive they will fix them throughout their growth. I'ts a good job for someone that is interested in working on electrical/ mechanical environment.
good,The ability for this company to be fulfilling for employment never came to the surface the management could not be trusted a very inconsistent company
good,"If you're looking for a challenge with lots of advancement opportunities, you need to work at FPL.

good,A fun work environment where both colleagues and managers are there to help. One of the very few jobs where teamwork is tantamount to both your personal success and that of your projects.

It is hard for me to think of the hardest part of the job because I enjoyed every aspect of my work and none of it seemed hard to me, having worked there for so many years.  Perhaps dealing with scheduling travel and/or meetings for the executives would be the most stressful part of the job, however it wasn't difficult because we had many resources at our disposal.
