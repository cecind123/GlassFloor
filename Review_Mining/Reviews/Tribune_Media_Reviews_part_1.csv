rating,review
bad,"A,job to work at when there is no other place to work i really dont have much to say about the company no health benefits and pay can be delayed by payroll"
bad,"This company began as a prestigious media network dedicated to it's duty to inform. Now, it simply goes through the motions. Corporate management is disconnected from stations that are being mismanaged at the local level. The station's management team is only concerned with obedience and sees collaboration and teamwork as a threat to their authority. Favorites they brought with them from a much smaller market have little experience. This results in a diminished product. Experienced employees feel increasingly hopeless."
bad,"TERRIBLE company! Your ""friends"" are your worst enemies. Horrible amount of backstabbing, poor wages, long hours and drama. I went through 5 bosses in 3 years. They came through one day and fired everyone, bringing in a bunch of ""teenagers"" to take everyone's places because they worked cheaper."
bad,"It's difficult to describe a typical work day here because every shift presented its own obstacles, from being tossed into rolls I've never been trained in before to directors having to run shows by the hip because producers didn't finish their scripts in time. Although I loved the pace and energy of working on a production team at a local news station (especially one that broadcasts two morning shows simultaneously) the disorganization, lack of oversight, and negative leadership style made this job very stressful and didn't advance me in my career the way I had hoped."
bad,at the station it was one of the most toxic work environments I've ever experienced. The Management is honestly so bad you have to see it to believe it. If you are someone who needs constructive criticism or just any support do not come work here.
bad,"Horrible micromanaging, favoritism, scapegoating. Employee morale depressing. Unfair review system, management is fear-based. So many unhappy people in toxic environment."
bad,Excessive amount of drama between employees and management. Shocking considering how small the company was. Not a good experience at all. Promotions were based on favoritism alone. All the good people were leaving. The stock prices for Tribune Media (parent company) dropped half their value in 1 year - it definitely felt like the ship was sinking. Would not recommend.
bad,"Working for Tribune Media was one of the worst job experiences I've ever encountered. Management not only lacked in communicating with their employees, but gave discouraging feedback. Everything well done went unnoticed and praise was never given for the good. Co workers spoke negatively towards each other and never gave helpful feedback."
bad,"High turn-over rate, horrible management, earnings are not enough for the responsibility/high stress. Typical new hire will work over-night shift until they are proven worthy to advance to 2nd shift. Getting to day shift is like waiting on someone to die. A lot of isolation in Master Control, communicating with other departments are frowned upon. Management loves to micro-manage and really doesn't care about you as a person. You do what you are told. Calling in sick, everyone was treated like a slacker ... felt bad for calling in for actually being sick because of the negative feedback from managers and co-workers when returning. When you call in, management doesn't have coverage...more work for everyone (resentment). You may think this review is pretty one sided ... but trust me, I put in several years and saw management come and go and there isn't a lot of positive to say, for a job that should be fun, rewarding and enjoyable this truly isn't. I saw this place go down hill fast and continued to stay at the bottom. If you're looking for a job to get you by ... go for it. You'll understand what I've posted here in time if you work for Tribune. Good luck finding something...broadcasting is a dying industry due to the internet. Go Information Technology/Business if you can."
bad,"Working at Tribune Media FOX59 was a challenge. There was little to no support from management. And, the environment on a daily basis was intense. It often times was a high school-like place to work in."
bad,Getting laid off twice wasn't that positive. The show that I worked on went through so many changes audiences members never knew what to expect.  The newsroom culture was allowed to be hostile without being checked or contained.
bad,"because the job is completely independent, there is no workplace or company culture. employees are drastically underpaid, and the head of the department is vindictive and not tolerant of mental health issues."
bad,"A typical day at work is monitoring emails, signal flow and quality."
bad,"When I joined this company the team in place had rebounded from bankruptcy during the recession. The team and leadership that remained for the most part were resourceful and watched out for their people. Then during a re-organization, our excellent divisional leader was unceremoniously forced out and they brought in new outside leadership from a competitor. The culture was instantly squashed and it all went downhill very quickly."
bad,"Terrible company, terrible pay, no raises, incompetent managers, and zero recognition for hard work. I regret ever joining this company and if you value your career you'll avoid this place at all costs."
bad,Management is out to prove that hard work dedication and seniority mean absolutely nothing. There must be a reason Tribune was sold. Don't believe the employees would benefit or profit from it.
bad,"This could've been a fun place to work because it is focused more on lifestyle than hard hitting news. There were some fun opportunities, but my manager was able to suck the fun out almost everything. He was a raving lunatic. Yelling and insulting people. He was not on top of dates and often would come out in a huff demanding a rush project that he forgot was coming due.  He did not pay attention to detail. He did not distribute the work fairly. He was immature. He held grudges if you did something he didn't like. He was obsessed with winning awards and would throw out perfectly good promos if they didn't please his ""friends in California"" all the while pressing the issue of being hyper local. This place is Mickey Mouse. Not a place to go if you are serious about a career but a good stepping stone if you're fresh out of school and need practice. No one there was at the top of their game."
good,"The company has never been the same since it went bankrupt around 10 years ago, with constantly changing management and ownership. It is now part of Nexstar Media after a corporate takeover."
good,"Management heavy, each one on your case all day long.  You never know which way to turn, you are given so much work and little time to do it all properly."
good,"Top level management was questionable.  The company was split off from Tribune Corporation.  Tribune Publishing was saddled with almost all the most burdensome costs, including all Publishing assets.  Tribune Media retained television stations, movie studios, production assets, and all real estate.  Substantial real estate holdings were all sold off - and company still managed to lose money to the point where the only way to keep it alive was to sell it off.  First attempt was to Sinclair Media, which they somehow managed to botch - eventual sale was to Nexstar."
good,I will not add or take away anything from this company it's just time to move on. I haven't been here very long so I don't have much to say.  They were bought shortly after I was hired. And I wish them all the best.
good,Constant churn at the upper levels of management makes goals change often. Working on shoestring budget forces employees to do more for less.
good,Master control was only noticed when something went wrong. It was sometimes tough to get paid time off. There was too much micromanaging within the department.
good,The culture at Tribune is friendly and supportive. The job offered good support and allowed freedom and autonomy to build your business within and under the Tribune umbrella.
good,I am grateful for my time spent at Tribune Media. It was a great learning experience that helped hone my marketing and sales skills.
good,"Daily local news in the nation's largest market. Deadline pressure. Great people, very competitive landscape. Huge learning opportunity for creative, ambitious and tenacious journalists."
good,"Channel 13(Tribune) had a record of hiring inept supervisors which created a combative and anxious atmosphere. "
good,KTLA was basically every man/woman for themselves. There were some very nice co-workers - and a lot of people to avoid. There was training on the CMS and other programs - the quality of that training depended upon who was doing the training. The most enjoyable aspect was turning a good news story and getting it on the air.
good,Was a great place to work.  People are great and really prudced a great product for years.  Industry and a lot of transition at top have hurt strategy and vision
good,"If you are in marketing or community relations, working for a media company helps you make connections that can boost your career in the future. But it is a lot of hours."
good,"I did audio engineering here for about a year and a half, and the training was great for the first few months. After that, there was no training AT ALL. There were many positions open in different but related departments all the time, but management refused to provide any opportunities for people to learn beyond what their current position was. It may have just been the manager at my specific station, but I heard it said that they didn't want to provide further training to employees for fear of making them more qualified for jobs outside of the company. In my opinion, a company that fears bettering its own employees has the wrong priorities."
good,Tribune is a good broadcasting company. Treats its employees fair. Demanding schedules and expectations for staff. For the most part a good place to work.

good,Tribune Media Indianapolis ran two News stations.  It was a fun challenge to promote two separate brands at the same time.  This duopoly situation forced a marketer to attempt to grow market share on one station without diminishing the viewership of the other.  Tribune invested in employee growth and often promoted from within whenever possible.
good,Uptight and stressful!!!  They play by the book.  I did learn one thing for the job but i had prior experience with the automation system.  Watching TV and working with the automation system was ok.
good,"The working atmosphere, people, and the product we put on air are great. The work load however isn't balanced to the paycheck. Compared to where other companies are in the market they are lower here. We just reported a really great quarter and we're still waiting for it to trickle down to the rest of us. They do have good PTO and are flexible with scheduling. Though many weeks you do over 40."
good,"Employees are extremely fun to work with.  Company as a whole lack communication.  When I arrived to work at CW 33 TV station in September 2014, there was a rift between Sales and Traffic. Since then, we have come together as one.  The Traffic Manager just need to own her department and stick to deadlines and speak up more."
good,"While the pay could be better, my day is not stressful. Because I work from home, I am afforded the time I need to keep a wonderful work/life balance. My management team is composed of those who demand your best work, but also demand that you take time for you. As long as the work gets done when it needs to be done, you are in the clear."
good,"Extremely fast-paced environment that doesn't allow for a lot of mistakes."
good,I enjoyed working here as it has a beautiful work environment and colleagues. Weekends lunch and also we use to have random parties at the office location. Christmas eve party was one of the best i have seen
good,"I enjoy the people I manage.  I'm a project manager with key skills in marketing, sales, finance, engineering, news and general management."
good,"Great Company, great products to sell, I wish they weren't up for sale!  It's a difficult job as many advertisers are going away from traditional media"
good,working at Tribune Media was totally different experience compare to all other position. I have learned alot how the media industry system work. I work with a good team members.
good,"Worked closely with VP of Group Sales in deals, speaking to contacts through all 42 of Tribunes television stations, and created vignettes. Wasn't much of a culture."
good,"Good organization with opportunity for advancement. Professional atmosphere, and very capable management team that welcomes employee feedback. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Good direction, lots of promise at this company. I Came in when my company was acquired.Really nice job acclimation the new ."
good,Tribune is a place to find lots of opportunities if you are willing to work hard. I think this company has a good deal of potential.
good,Hosted a 3 hour lonng morning show that started at 5 am. The hours were long and it was a start up show so there was a lot of stress and long hours. We did make it into a very sucessful launch.
good,"If your'e looking for an internship or entry level job at a news station in Denver, I think FOX 31 is a great stepping stone for those looking to know more about the industry and make those connections to take you to the next level in your career."
good,Working for Tribune Media was a great experience.  Working in Chicago is something everyone should do.  I have never worked at a company with so many friendly people.  It must be a mid0west thing.
good,"Most days I would come in and choose from a list of stories I could edit. After I chose the story, I'd gather resources to edit the story. Then I'd edit the story and get it approved by a manager before it aired on live TV."
good,"Level 3 Support desk technician for newly formed Tribune Media company. Phone and remote computer support provided by configuring software, and analyzing and resolving problems on PC desktops, laptops, printers, and mobile devices. Included 2nd shift and after hours support."
good,"I can't speak for regular employees but as a temp in the payroll department, I was super impressed with the group."
good,I have been here for just over a year now and I believe this is a great place to work for an entry level job that has offers for advancement within the company.
good,I worked in a very close knit department.  I reported to and worked closely with the director of finance which enabled me to learn a great deal of credit and collections. I made educated decisions on extending credit and follow up on all outstanding invoices.
good,"Overall, a good experience, great team, very personable leadership, open-door policy. Unsure what will happen after the merge, expect a lot to change.."
good,I really enjoyed the team work I had with my team. I enjoyed training new employees and the rest of our team on new programs. My manager was very helpful and allowed me to grow.

good,Tribune Media was an awesome company to work for unfortunately it has now been acquired by NexStar Media Company which does not share the same type of opportunities.
good,"Provided a great opportunity to develop and grow your career.  Resources and training were readily available and management support was constant.  Pay was moderate to good, but there were opportunities to grow through promotion in expanding roles, positions."
good,very friendlly environment. Had good experience to work for this company and learned many more things while working for this company.
good,"A typical work day would be considered as always being challenged. Working in the Engineering Dept., I never had the Director looking over my shoulder. He would give an assignment and walk away knowing it would be taken care of. I was taught how to work independently and have a eye for detail. Co-workers were people that could be depended on and able to share their knowledge with me and others. The hardest part of the job was knowing where to get answers when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was being challenged on a daily basis. Being to set the bar high for myself and others."
good,"Great place to work. People are very nice, and they do a lot for the employees. I wish this was a permanent position but it isn't. I am a Contractor here ."
good,A typical day at work is very action packed and filled with work to do. Great placed to learn on a higher level in a big market. Flexible with time off and accommodation.
good,"I learned, hands on the Workday program"
good,"Company grew with acquisitions and with new managements significant changes were made to update with new financial systems.   hardworking employees, friendly working atmosphere,"
good,Great people and energetic office.  Willing to train new staff.  Not always open to new ideas. It's a typical local newsroom. Every day is different and that's a good thing.
good,"The company is being sold but it has been a wonderful place to learn - lots of challenges, changes acquisitions and divestitures.  Several great leaders over the years."
good,"Tribune Media focuses on telling accurat, fair, and compelling stories. Employees are respected and treated well. I've been in the business for five years and this is the best company I have ever worked for."

good,"Had 8 hr. shifts."
good,"I have worked at two separate entities of this company. "
good,Internet has ruined the newspaper industry so I was forced to look for other places to work. I learned great management skills at the Chicago Tribune.
good,"I hosted the Z100 morning radio show with local DJ's, Dr. Doug and Skippy. We went live on-air at 6am until 10pm. Management was great! Everyone was fun and energetic. The hardest part of my job was being super energetic at 6am. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to celebrities. This was by far one of the greatest jobs I have had."
good,"Table right there and culture was awesome. "
good,"Amazing place to work. Good work culture and ample opportunity to grow, but can get political and extremely competitive"
