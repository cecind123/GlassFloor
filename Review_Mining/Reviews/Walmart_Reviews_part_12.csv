good,Not a bad place to work although I believe management is too busy to really have any idea who any of the employees are.
good,"The work experience is okay at wal - mart. They do teach you new things from time to time, depending on your locations. Slow mornings, busy afternoons and slow nights."
good,"Clocked in and as soon as I got to my department, there was always a list of things that needed to be done prior to the everyday things."
good,"If you go to work at Wal-Mart, to not expect to get hired on making good money. There is good money to be made, but not until you have been there a while and become a Shift Manager or Store Manager."
good,"Most days are filled with customer service. On the rare slow days there is still lots to do, like cleaning and organizing."

good,"stocking, ordering, maintain stock levels, cleanliness of the store, have knowledge of every area of the store. Co workers- were wonderful and easy to talk to for advice. Hardest part of the job- was that as an assistant manager you were subject to be moved to anywhere at anytime. Most enjoyable part- customer service and associates that took pride in their job."
good,"I was a very good worker kept area clean, friendly & cheerful most of time. was willing to try new jobs.  for most part got along ok with assistant management & coworkers no one can do this every day , got to keep it interesting, the hardest part of any job is to get C.S.M's to answer a call from a casher when money or help is needed with register...    the best part of the job is the people & little kids coming into store & joking with customers. over all I like working with public."
good,"I answered phones, helped customers get their prescriptions, data entry, stocking shelves."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to understand every customers needs and to make sure it was performed in the best way possible. I enjoyed my co-workers and the flexiblilty of my schedule.
good,I have to keep the department stocked and customers happy. I learned a lot about retail and how to stock inventory. I like the co-workers and I get along with them well. But the hardest part about the job is being understaffed while working multiple departments by yourself. I have learned to multitask well from this.
good,"The workload is not too bad.  However, the ""team"" atmosphere is not there.  One employee may contribute 150% and another 5%.  There is no balance."
good,"Todos os dias Chegava na empresa, e era colocada em setores que estava precisando de reforço, de ajuda e fazia de tudo um pouco."
good,"When I first get to work I get setup for the day making sure we bags up front along with receipt tape, balance cash funds. Monitor the front-end and ensure everything runs smoothly. Making sure cashier, service desk associates, and money center have have breaks/lunches in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job is working long hours sometimes and dealing with customers who comes in under the influence. My co-workers are amazing. I enjoy meeting new people and assisting people when needed, whether it's a customer or an associate."
good,"I liked working as a overnight stocker. I quit due to a tornado that effected close family, and we had to help them clean up and everything. The only problem I had here was, scheduling. I had to ask for my schedule the first two months and they kept forgetting to put me on the schedule. Other than that the pay was good, and I got trained very well."
good,"Start my day at work clocking in on time, get to the area im scheduled in to relieve the person that scheduled to leave, start my duties. I learned how to send money from state to state and out of states. I work well with my management and coworker we all treat each other as family and we all give respect an help out each other. The hardest part of my job is seeing any of my coworkers upset or having a bad day we all try to help each other out with and be their to listen to each other. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers get/find what they are looking for or need."
good,learned more about cashier experience. very busy part time job
good,"Wal-Mart is a very busy place to work. I had a great time working with all the different co-workers in many departments. The toughest part of the day would be working with difficult customers, but that didn't happen hardly at all in the Jewelry Dept. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with the public!"
good,"i would clock in then have a nightly meeting describing the night. afterwards we would as a team sweep the store in sections, then do our specifically assigned jobs such as restrooms or buffing the floors. i was often stuck with three of these due to lack of staff often buffing,restrooms, and cart corralling. afterwards we would sweep the store again and wait for our shifts to be over."
good,it was okay to work. coworkers were not as nice as i thought. The management only care about making money.
good,"Overall the work day was pretty easy, I would process and through out all the outdated meat, process the new inventory and organize it in the freezer, and then through out the day I would restock the meat as it diminished. I learned how to catalog and sort products as well as intake and outtake of inventory. Management was very helpful and very easy to work for, always being there for me if I needed help or were struggling with a part of the job. Co-workers were also very nice and very helpful right when I started the job. There were no really hard parts of my job it was all fairly tedious and mundane. The most enjoyable part of my job was organizing the intake product in the freezer."
good,"worked the cash and looked after customers had designated work stations were i maintained the stock on shelves and displays while helping customers find items even in other departments."
good,"My typical work days were very intensed which allowed me to push through adversities. This job taught me how to work with all cultures. As a manager I was able to exercise my talents,and skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was problem solving."
good,"Working at the Wal-Mart in Lockport wasn't too bad, I wish the employees were a little nicer but I dealt with it. I wouldn't mind working for Wal-Mart, because the pay was okay, and it was a good experience for me."
good,Un travail satisfaisant en général pour une étudiante. Il y a possibilité d'avancement qui est bien et avantage sociaux. Une bonne dynamique de travail avec les employés.
good,Its a job good pay when you first start but left lacking after starting and messed up rules.
good,Hard work for small pay and no benefits. Co-workers were always in a bad mood and as was the management. A typical day included operating forklifts and loading mulch and sand into customer vehicles.

good,"well I was left alone to work more often than not "
good,A typical night is clocking in to work going to my work area and down stacking my frieght and then working it into the areas it belongs. After completeing all of my frieght then I am required to zone my area.
good,"en la empresa me enseño al manejo del personal, a crecer en lo personal y laboral, con mis asociados tenia una buena relación ya que me gusta trabajar a la par con ellos para así poderles enseñar todo lo que yo sabia, el mi trabajo lo mas difícil era al principio el manejo del personal y ahora en día lo que mas me gusto fue trabajar y aprender mucho de las personal que tuve como jefe inmediato en su momento y el formar un equipo de  trabajo estable durante los años que dure de encargado de tienda."
good,"Fun working with my coworkers, difficult job is mostly fun especially when we get things done early. learning how to handle the work each day. Make the job fun as much as possible."
good,"I loved this job. I was always around people and I had first dibs on the bargains. The pay was not that great however at the time it was good enough for me. I would go back if I could get more pay now. The hardest part for me was to work the weekends especially Sundays. My immediate manager, she was great. The top manager was not. He was too much and made big issues out of nothing. Even if you weren't on the clock he didn't want you to stop and talk to another employee that may have been working on the floor still working...just too much. I didn't like the way parents would allow their kids to run and play in the store."
good,I enjoyed helping customers with what every they needed. I learned that team work was very important to make the job flow very easy.The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and giving them feed back to make a better out come of the situation.My co workers were very amazing and helpful.
good,A typical day at work is high volume routines and tasks making sure that all jobs are complete and before leaving and shift changes make sure that work stations are cleaned and properly ready for the next employee to work in your area and that all merchandise is in its proper place. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everything is done and complete in a reasonable manner and sharing the load and not leave behind any problems or situations for someone else to have to sort or finish your routine.Leave your shift in a good working manner and condition for the next person. The part I enjoy most about my job is the Team Work and People Working together with positive Motivation and Enthusiasm and Positive Attitude along with the Customers coming back and praising the Cashier or Customer Service for a job well done.
good,Una empresa que se encuentra basada en la obtención de objetivos para mejorar sus ventas

good,buen trabajo solo que le falta una mayor remuneración a sus asociados.
good,"Everyday is busy and very productive. There is something always to do. I learn a lot at Walmart  especially learning to work the telxons. The management team work hard to keep order and security in the building. My co-workers also work hard on keeping the building clean and clear of any debris and they help our customers with the merchandises that they need. At my job I don't have anything that is hard but I do have a lot to enjoy. My customers, co-workers and the job."

good,"My management crew are very intelligent people, good working environment and treated me very well."
good,"A typical day include customer services, stocking and culling of merchandises. receiving and stocking new freight. Management is good, not to accessible tho. Not a really good and close crew, co-workers don't really work as team orientated as they are intended to. I like my job but is a physically exhausting job."
good,"Worked in the meat department alone."

good,The hardest part of the job was coping with the immense pressure from management to perform all duties without outside aid while adhering to all safety regulations and meet all performance expectations.
good,"my typical day at work would consist of running threw my notes of things i had to do for the day. there was always plenty of freight to run everyday but unfortunately some co workers were usually barely seen and which it created a greater work load for my self and the other associates in my department. management seemed to be on a whole different page than most of their associates, it typically took management anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes to respond to any associates or customers at any given time, only a few select managers were always on point, on time, and quickly and effectively responding to all calls for management. the most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishing so much in my day to day basis on the job and being able to get more done at the end of the night and being able to come in the next day and build off of that."
good,"Being a product assembler I had pride in building products for the customer and for display for Wal-Mart.  Enjoyed building bicycles for children recieving their 1st bike.  I did inventory on products , assembled products and did minor mechanical upkeep withing the store. Had to be their a year to recieve medical insurance"
good,"Typical, clock in get on register that your assigned to, wait for till, clean your area, zone, clock out for lunch, clock back in, go to different register with a different till. Listen to managers complain about their job, or the male managers flirt with you and the 30 other female cashiers you work with. Here all the drama about people sleeping with multiple people. I would have really enjoyed it if there wasn't high school drama. Plus I had gotten severely sick, called in and talked to a manager. Had two days off to recover,was told if i didn't come back, I shouldn't at all. Well family drama occurred and I ended up moving and I tried calling, several, several times to no avail. I didn't know what to do."
good,The job had excellent benefits and great customer service reps. The main source of issue was the lack of true management.
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking the products and cleaning up the floor and shelves making it presentable then assisting customers and also cleaning up through out the day. Also responding to till calls and directing people to different products."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for especially for military spouses because of the fact that when you need to move around with the military you can transfer to different locations.

good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and making sure they are satisfied and happy.
good,A typical day at Wal-MArt is making sure my coustmers are happy.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. They really work with you if something comes up and you have to leave work early (ie: family emergency, become ill, etc...) The associates are kind, and very helpful to new people, nobody hesitates to help. Management could be worked on, sometimes it seems as if nobody is on the same page. My favorite part about working at Walmart is interacting with the customers. You meet great people. Hardest part would be learning the Telzon, but you eventually get the hang of it."
good,I learned customer service skills and how to operate a forklift.
good,"Enjoy the QA role work. Nice to get best opportunity and challenging one where I can extensive work on QA role and nice to have exposure as Business analyst."
good,"walmart is a place you can laugh,cry,and met new friends.Typicial day at wal-mart is fast paced,a lot of interesting customers and employees coming in and out the store"
good,The day to day job isn't bad. The co-workers are great. However the hours are the bad part.
good,"Typical day at work started with collecting your Tel-Zon (Scanner gun) and printer from the management office and moving on to sign into your first task of the night. After that it was onto the ""picks"" which were items that the store's system had pulled out of the shelves for you to fill the empty holes in the sales floor. Things with my co-workers went very smoothly as we were all close friends, and still are outside of work. The hardest part about this job was having to deal with the different things that our management team wanted done within a certain amount of time, with all of them wanting something else done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers, as they made the job enjoyable for me."
good,"My work here is about find missing money by managing paperwork and reviewing data input. I have experience in all ares of walmart I have worked as a customer service manager for 2 years, a department manager for 2 years and have worked in the offices for the last seven years. some days I  work in the c/o balancing and reconciling the previous days sales, there are also time that I cover the human resources  office which also includes managing payroll for 250 associates. attendance, hiring and training. My role most days is to file and distribute paperwork to associates verify and maintain compliance files for all departments find missing assets through a variety of different reports and communicate my findings directly to the store manager and market manager on a weekly basis."
good,My day was filled with a variety of tasks and a need to work closely with my co-workers. The learning process was on-going and working with each patient was a different experience. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was explaining to patients about options for their eye care needs. The best part of the job was when a patient left happy with their decisions about their glasses and was excited to wear their glasses.
good,"We get our picks from the shelves and re-stock the shelves.  We ensure we properly rotate the products.  Once that is completed, we get the freight that came in earlier and put that on the shelves.  The overstock, we take back and our back room personnel put on the shelves or pallets.  The co workers work closely together.  The night managers are great, they listen and help out the best they can.  Getting pallets and overstock off the floor before 7am is the hardest depending on the fresh freight and vendors bringing in their products.  Working on freight all night, the time goes by fast and before you know it, it's time to go home, it's great"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, plus I also loved the job that I had. It was a position that not only made me feel good, but was very beneficial to the store."
good,Learned how to work as a team and appreciate the customer. Had lots of fun working with al different types of people from people who have everything and just wanna work to those who have nothing and have the job to pay rent and put food on the table for there families.
good,"Routine schedule, Work, 15 min break, work, lunch, work, 15 min break, work, clock out. All in the course of a 12 hour workday"
good,"If you like routines in your life and schedule and like to advance quickly in an industry, Wal-Mart is the place to work! I'll be honest when we got new management I was very disappointed. The new manager was running the place like a refugee camp, cutting people's hours left and right and even of those who had been working there for 10 YEARS or more!! I had to resign due to the fact that they would not give me Friday nights or Sunday mornings off for church or school... I'm pretty sure there's a law against this kind of thing, in fact there is! I just know I couldn't go up against such a giant corporation without a great lawyer and ending up paying more than what I'd get to sue a company like Wal-Mart! My coworkers were the best part of the job! The cashiers were like a little family, the hardest part of the job is spending time with friends and family as you will be practically living in your 2nd home with all of the hours they give you!"
good,Loved working with customers and team members.  Standing too long on my feet.
good,Walmart is Ok it something for the now. I would like something better and in my field. I have completed the diploma part of my Medical Adminstrative Assistant almost done with my A.S degree.
good,"Loved meeting new people of all races and ethnicities.  Hours and pay were not that great, but it was a great working environment.  Everyone helped each other out.  Some of the assistant managers were nice and great to get along with.  Others were not so much.  Good place to start off, if you aren't looking for a high paying job."
good,"This environment was casual in the sense a normal job tends to be I would gloat on anything special, I was a sale clerk at the paint and hardware desk, tending to the need of mixing paint at the customers request and organizing aisle during times of intermission."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be, coming to work ready to get my job done and help customers, i learned how to drive a forklift and the walking stacker, and how to read barcodes to place stock on the shelf in the correct area, my co-workers where great people to work with and assisted me when i needed help. the most enjoyable part of the job was it was easy and it had good benefits."
good,"I have managed over 11 different departments in the total box store. I have managed four department managers and nine sales floor staff. I also managed thousands of products from 300 different top companies from all over the world. I control in stock inventory, ordering, vendors, product launches and many other aspects of retail."
good,It was always fun to be hands on with customers you would be surprised to know how good service could have a positive impact on a customers life. Coworkers were great hard working people. Majority of management didn't try to have positive words for their workers. All too often only the negative was mentioned about performance and some choose to take advantage of their position.
good,Empresa vive momento conturbado e ainda não encontrou seu equilíbrio financeiro nem de clima organizacional.
good,"Third shift, stocking shelves, for eight hours during the holidays."
good,"It's never boring, and always fast paced at Wal-Mart.  We have three communication meetings to get the day started and set priorities for the day.  Throughout the day I follow up with notes and projects in all of my areas of responsibility, and allocate any additional help to finish the tasks for the day.  I also handle management calls, follow up on personnel paperwork/training, assess merchandising, follow up with in stock levels, and keep a constant flow of communication between the associates and upper management for up coming and current changes in the store and the company.  My favorite part is working on projects.  I was given two large project to oversee during my time as an assistant manager.  I supervised the refrigerant change out for our entire grocery side of the store.  This project took two weeks, communication with several managers from other stores, and constant follow up with associates.  The other project, was the new inventory management system (IMS).  I became fluent in the processes, and went on to help other stores in our market and in Ohio."
good,"Job was fast pace, great hours and very flexible with schedule. Leaned a lot from working there."
good,picking orders working as a team with my co workers its a good place to work
good,"La empresa es excelente, lo que hace dificil del trabajo es cuando tu trabajas con honestidad y por parte de tus superiores no hay una etica laboral entonces tu trabajo esta en riesgo pero ante todo tienes que seguir repetando tus valores y nunca faltar a ellos."
good,I was a department manager.  My typical day started with a review of the department and what needed to be done.  I would stock merchandise and clean the department.  I also ordered and displayed merchandise.  I also assisted customers.

good,"Empresa envolvida com o bem estar e a segurança dos funcionários."
good,"A typical day at work includes entering data to keep track of valuable inventory followed by aggressive customer service. I have learned to be a better person publicly in order to better the customer service experience for each and every individual. Management is always fair and balanced and only asks of me what my job requires without stepping out of line. My co-workers are always a joy to be around and have a great understanding for professional and personal life. The hardest part of my job can be the physical aspects at times when having to deal with heavy objects, but that is never a problem. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I receive from customers. There are so many good people out there and to see a genuine smile on these faces makes my day."
good,Utilize customer service skills to help customers make retail decisions.
good,it was an overall nice place to work there was a lot of room to learn and advance in the company. management was nice and created a good work environment. the only problem was the workers and even the management liked to gossip a lot and bring personal business to work
good,"8 hour shift stocking counters and helping customers."
good,"Since I have been at Walmart I have learned how to supervise other employees, money handling, customer service skills, and also working in the accounting office. Working in the accounting office I learned how to do deposits, paperwork, etc."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee and I was bounced around everywhere so I got a lot of experience. I was stocking, unloading and loading the trucks. I was a cashier and I was in the customer service department."
good,"Before each shift there was a meeting on how the store was doing, goals and what each person needed to do for the night. I learned organization, how to work and help customers at the same time, information on a wide variety of product. Most of management was awesome, it just took time to see how each manager did things and what they expected. I was even able to get along with one of the most unapproachable managers because I took my job seriously. The hardest part of my job was remembering so much information at the start but there were always other employees that were very helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of getting all of my work done."
good,"too many managers can't get jobs completed one is always sending you somewhere and the other somewhere else."
good,"The job is very stressfull, at times to many Chiefs and not enough indians.  Very fast paced and physical by walking 3 to 4 miles per shift.  I am a people person and enjoy working with the public BUT some can be very difficult but I like working with them"
good,Algo de lo malo de  walmar es que hay que hacer mucho la barba para poder crecer y eso a mi nunca me ha parecido.
good,Walmart was a very busy place to work and you never seemed to have enough hours in the day.  Being a customer Service Manager was a rewarding but stressful job.  I love working in customer service and it was satisfying to know that I was helping the customers.  The benefits were good but management needed some help with the store and were also to stressed out.
good,"As a stockman our job can be very exausting. They provided us with two breaks and an hour lunch. Free water. The hardest part of the job was the lack of Stockman working at one time. Some days we had four of us on the lot and other days it was just one of us. Also you have to work rain, snow, sleet or sun. Not much fun most of the time."
good,Empresa de grande porte que oferece benefícios interessantes para seus associados e oportunidades de crescimento para os que se interessam em um plano de carreira.
good,Honestly Wal-Mart isnt a horrible place to work i loved working there the managers ruined my work days constantly with there awfu attitudes
good,"Fun co-workers and customers, and management was very kind and caring"
good,The managers made the job fun and exciting great work enviornment. This would have been better if jobs were on amore permanent basis.
good,enjoying the people coming to my lane making them smile talking with them..didnt lean alot was only their a few months.managment was ok.co working was not nice to me..the hardest part of the job was people act like they didnt want to help me..talking with the customers was fun
good,"My experience at Walmart was mixed. A typical day consisted of me being confined to one or more cash registers  with about 6 inches of free space on all sides. I would spend all day standing. The customers were mostly friendly and cooperative, but there were a large number of difficult or rude customers that regularly visited. I learned how to operate a cash register, how to operate unsupervised in the cash office, how to identify items based on the barcode information, how to properly manage my time, and how to exhibit successful and professional customer service. Management was so-so, with some wise decisions being made and some poor decisions. My co-workers were mostly friendly and helpful, though employee turnover was fairly high and there were constantly new faces. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place all day long and being unable to freely move about, even to go to the bathroom or get a drink. The most enjoyable part for me was succeeding in my duties and performing the best to my abilities."
good,More of a family orientated environment but good to work in.
good,"my days are extremely busy, a typical day consists of communicating with the overnight managers in order to obtain information regarding what needs to be completed. I then bin or stock the freight from the night before. after that I would scan my dept. searching for opportunities of improvement. I order what needs to be ordered, pick what needs to be picked. I set new features based on sales and season. I have to zone and maintain a clean working environment, along with ensure a great customer experience. I merchandise my areas, and task out my associates and follow up. I have learned so much while being with wal mart. I have leaned to lead people and accomplish new goals everyday. I have seen that my hard work and dedication will allow me to better myself. My management has taught me the value of relationships with people, along with how far positive reinforcement can go. Myself along with two of my closest coworkers have grown together and pushed each other  through the tough times, and for that I have grown so much as a person. The toughest part of my job is the under staffing of my store, because it makes myself along with my coworkers pick up the pieces. I have no problem with picking up what we lack in staffing with extra hard work, but I feel it takes away from the customer experience, and for me that is what retail is all about. Although it gets tough at times I appreciate my job very much, and have been able to promote four times in three years."
good,"A rotina não chega a ser estressante, mas pede uma responsabilidade e comprometimento maior todos os dias. Aprende-se a ser mais cuidadoso, já que trabalhamos próximos diretamente aos funcionários. Por ser geralmente um setor pequeno, acabamos tendo uma gerencia ""separada"", o que favorece o trabalho ser independente; já que temos a quem responder diretamente. A parte mais dificil dessa função é quando pegamos alguém em delito e temos que relatar sem pensar nas futuras correções; ja a parte boa é que somos referencia de boas pessoas e bons cidadaos;"
good,"Walmart is a very high volume, fast paced company the requires a lot of time and hours to operate. I love it because its very challenging and its a great experience if you plan to persuit a management position anywhere."
good,"I worked for Walmart and I learned almost all my skills there. I had the honor to work with great team, who was very helpful, friendly, and humble."
good,"If you don't have any member of management breathing down your neck thats good, but it's not very common either."
good,"Es un buen trabajo,con ambiente laboral cambiante,poco sentido comun para la toma de decisiones."
good,"-My daily routine at work is, we start off with a meeting seeing how the sales of the day was and to see what department we get put in, for example, im usually in the food department, so I stock and separate the product.  Then around 5am  We usually Start to clean up whitch includes, pulling back skids, cleaning up all the cardboard and making sure the stores nice and zoned up before 7am opening time."
good,"A typical work day in Sam's Club marketing department consisted of finding new leads in business and evaluating existing customers to see if they were able to upgrade their memberships."
good,"Great job security, but it is hard to climb the ladder without transferring stores. I learned a lot about how to get ahead in the work place."
good,"like any other retailer store out there"
good,"My co-workers were awesome, the atmosphere within the store was overall a calm n less stressful attitude, the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with the customers"
good,They were a unfair place to work they gave men higher salaries then the women and didn't let you advance within the company
good,"A typical day a Wal-Mart was clocking in checking my notebook to see what needed to be done and getting right to it. First off I would have to walk around my section of the store and make sure my associate has done his or her work. next would be to fill in the paint tint and checking my price changes. Towards the end of the shift around three i would go up and help out with the cashiers and check and leave notes for the associates that i didn't get to see."
good,The most enjoyable part was consistently interacting people.
good,"As an overnight associate the night shift starts at 11:00 pm and ends at 7:00 am. The night starts with a meeting where the nights routine is set for all the crew. It is also the feedback time. The meeting ends with the stretches and followed by typical Walmart cheer. As a support manager , my manager decides , where to work. General merchandise or food side, on the sales floor or backroom. Management is very helpful in training you. They encourages to make decisions which helps in making quick but important decisions regarding the freight or featured items. Usually the night crew runs with a minimum number of associates which can be really challenging during the busy Christmas season."

good,My co-workers were good hard work who would join together to go that extra mile and then some to not only get the job done but to get great things accomplished in the community. The work environment was a comfortable fit with challenging hard work and the challenge to exceed the customer's expectations and needs each day while felling the pride of accomplishment in a job done to the best of my abilities.

good,I learned to deal with all types of people and personalities.
good,I learned alot about myself and my ability to manage my time.
good,"In the deli at walmart we are required to clean the equipment while assisting customers until closing. We do not have a swing shift manager and so are in charge of our own breaks and lunches, and must deal with customer complaints to our own judgement. The most difficult part of this job is the fluctuation of hours from month to month. The part I love most is the freedom to dictate ourselves throughout the shift."
good,"Walmart was a great job opportunity. I enjoyed working there, although management is a bit of an issue."
good,"A empresa foi muito importante na minha formação profissional, pois aprendi muito como pessoa e também como Líder. Tive a oportunidade de ouvir histórias de vida de alguns associados que liderei e muitas vezes cheguei a ficar emocionado com o que ouvia. Aprendi que as pessoas (associados) tem problemas e na maioria das vezes afeta no seu dia-a-dia na empresa. Como gestor eu tinha que saber lidar com a situação, nos casos mais sérios eu envolvia meu gestor para juntos (como representantes da empresa) trazer uma solução e ajudar o associado. Não tenho do que me queixar, só agradecer pelo tempo de aprendizagem na empresa."
good,The opportunity to work with many different cultures of people was great.
good,"There was always a meeting to keep everyone informed of what was going on in the store. I learned how to use a telzon unit and how to bin and pick merchandise. Management did the best they could to keep everyone on task by using a new task manager. Hardest part of the job was pulling pallets to the floor at night for stocking the shelves. Hardest part of the job was zoning the departments at the end of the night. I always felt like something was not done or left incomplete. I enjoyed the sense of family within the staff. There was always a feeling of ""We are in this together"" with everyone that worked there."
good,"It's a okay job if you need to make a type of income. They train you at the position your looking for but the fast pace can be a little overwhelming. You mostly work at your register but are asked to perform additional tasks. Management is a tad unreliable only when the store is packed. The hardest part of the job was the hours, if your not specific, they'll put you to work when ever. The most enjoyable is the variety of things your asked to do so your not mainly on the register all day."
good,"Es una empresa la cual cuida mucho su imagen,sus valores y su cultura, se aprende mucho ya que cuenta con muchos cursos y juntas motivacionales, y es una empresa llena de retos y cambios."

good,"a Typical day at work is any other day. I have learned how to deal with Cash, Debit and Visa, My co workers were the best, they were kind and helpful when they are needed. Hardest part of the job is when you are stuck and there is no one around to help you, but figuring it out is the best part knowing that you can do it alone and have succeeded. "
good,"Each new day is a new experience.  I love seeing familiar faces on the line, it's the best part of the day."
good,There was no time to balance your life with work. Your job always was to come first.
good,"Work is non stop from the time I come in to the time I leave. The first thing you learn in this place is problem solving. Management has comumication problems between shifts, but willing to help out when trouble starts. Most of the co-workers are easy going, and when fully staffed the work place can be fun. The hardest part of the job is that we are not fully staffed."
good,this particular walmart had a much more family type vibe than other walmarts ive seen
good,"Down-stack pallets of new freight to appropriate department then stock merchandise on shelves."
good,"The work was simple, yet redundant."
good,it was a good place for their benefits but they did not do research into why people were getting injured so much
good,Fast paced environment that helped me improved on speed and organization. I also had various task to complete while assisting customers. Management didn't play a effective roll but was okay. My co-workers were great individuals. Next i'd have to say the most difficult part of the job was then we e had big truckloads. Last is the most enjoyable part was my coworkers and how efficient and fast we would finish all our task in a timely manner.
good,I am working here from October 2013. Work environment is very good. Everybody is cooperative and self motivated but their hourly payment is no good. Recently I passed Pharmacy Technician Board Exam. So I am looking for Pharmacy Job. But they don't have any opening right now.
good,This job was temporary position that was hired through Wal Mart to help contribute to a company remodel that I assisted in.  There was two parts to this remodel.  The in-store part and the warehouse side that was contracted handle all the equipment for the remodel.  I worked in the warehouse side and managed all the inventory for the remodel.
good,Always packed with customers but it kept me busy throughout the work day.
good,Wal-Mart values it's customers. They really support the customer's is always right rule. I learned a lot about customer service and how to provide it successfully. I learned how to work with local law enforcement and the judicial systems and courts. The hardest part of my job at Wal-Mart was nothing I loved everything I did. My co-workers were very great at training me and never let me down as a team. However the management was horrible not my manager but other managers. The had bad communication and did care much for the loss prevention aspect. The most enjoyable part of my job was my Loss Prevention team.
good,I enjoyed a daily routine of working at the front end cashiering. i got to meet new people on a daily basis. no two days were the same. when not cashing out customers i enjoyed zoning the departments that were close by my register helping out my fellow employees.

good,"Oportunidade de aprendizado, diversificação, confiança, facilidade de contato com outros estados. A empresa como um todo trata seus funcionários como iguais."
good,"I worked as a cashier and everwhere else. There are a lot of people there that just don't take pride in what they do, or shuold I say have work ethic."
good,"This job has helped me gain experience in what I should expect from a workplace. The hardest part is typically how managers handle stress and time. I feel that they should not be reliant on talking down to a person rather than approach it a serious, yet non-demeaning way."
good,"Audits, compliance walks with Regulatory Bodies. Conference calls, accident reporting and supervising of staff. I learnt so much about Health and Safety and Food Safety. I enjoyed everything about this job, as I was always learning, everyday."
good,"House wares Dept. Receiving Warehouse department"
good,stocking making sure everything is good to go. I liked it but the pay wasn't good enough.
good,I worked as a Stocker and also as a Loss Prevention Agent. A typical day at this job I would be walking around the department store monitor the customers as they shop.
good,"Good Hours"
good,"In overall Wal-Mart is a workplace where you can learn a lot of thing in a little amount of time, you can start as a cashier one day and 3 month later you can be a manager everything depends on the amount of effort you put into the company."
good,Didn't work there very long I was only seasonal it was fun while it lasted but the management was very poor but the people I worked with were pretty awesome.
good,Managing the front end... Beating sales plan from previous year
good,"* a typical day at walmart is a lot different then my past employer, its not as  stressful and complex it consists of standing at a register cashing items for the customer"
good,I enjoyed working with public and meeting new people. I also had to make schedules for my associates. I learned that working together as a team works alot better than trying to do it all by yourself. I loved going in and getting our stuff done and making the department look great and presentable.
good,"good job,met alot of customer and helped them find what they wanted.Then they done away with the people greeter job."
good,Great place to learn and grow.  Learned a lot of merchandising and people skills.
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Wal-mart. I enjoyed working with my employees and serving my customers. A typical day at Wal-mart was usually busy and hectic, but enjoyed it. Management was good, and for the most part I did not have any difficulties with my job."
good,Over all this job is a great job but I am looking for something preferably during the day as I have two school aged children who I would like to see more of.
good,"A typical day included working at a register or customer service, always communicating to customers and other co-workers.  I learned how to be versatile and do many different tasks during a single shift such as cleaning, gathering shopping carts, talking to customers, and being articulate with Walmart policies towards customers.  The management was very organized and all the co-workers were supportive.  The hardest part was being respectful and polite to customers when they were disrespectful to myself or other employees.  The most enjoyable part of being a cashier was how fast the time went while working.  I was constantly occupied with tasks and lead to the day going by very quickly."
good,"movimento"
good,"Easy laid back job, supervisors were nice. The best part of the job was that the supervisors would give you all the help you need."
good,"Customer service, respect the individuals, strive for excellency, and work with indignity."
good,A typical day was 8 to 10 hrs. I learned every day about working as a team and how to make a positive contribution. For the most part management were very knowledgeable and hard working team leaders. All of my coworkers were a close nit unit who worked well with each other. The hardest part of the job was constantly changing hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting and helping people.
good,"overwork the people that do show up for work,, Favortism is a daily occurrence. Things you learn in orientation are not comparable to the actual floor activities."
good,i've learned how to work in groups and alone. i've also learned in this job on how to take control of a situation and solve problems. The hardest part of the job was trying to help everyone at once
good,My major was Pre-pharmacy  but I have since changed to Occupational Therapy. I would love to keep this job but working 39.5 hrs per week on top of my school studies is too much.
good,"The merchants and support staff are great, and they all make a point to try to teach each other, and to maintain extremely good communication. "
good,The typical day at Walmart is basically staying at the register
good,Ran a forklift and was responsible to get the correct shelving to the store for a remodel. Also had to sort the old shelving from the store out and send it to refurbish plant.
good,I like working for Wal Mart the only thing is when a customer needs assistance they are waiting for a long period of time to have someone come to help them and when a manager is called for help or when a cashier needs help they are waiting for a while and it then cause frustration and upsets the customer when they are on a time spand and want to get out of the store after being there for a long time doing there shopping. One good thing I like is all the employees get a break every two hours and they make sure everyone has a break.
good,"Great company to work for. Just wasn't t that fair with you if you didn't have open availability. But other than that, it was a good company to work for. Had some good qualities, such as associate discounts,& advance pay if you needed money before your payday. Loved my job & miss it."
good,"working at Wal-Mart there was no down time and there was always something to do in a different department. I learned how to adapt to the different departments very easily, and that if work slowed up in one department to go over to another. Management was good, they made sure you were okay, and got your breaks on time. My co-workers were great! The hardest part of the job was standing and walking around the entire store all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others."
good,"Was productive and exciting at the time"
good,not to safe and the employers don't care about you or your will being
good,always busy time flies not once do you get bored. many things to do. set schedules you meet a variety of people.

good,"work day would have many task to complete and depending on your job title. I was cross trained in most of the departments regarding to In-stock, unloading, to learning the sales floor, and the different parts of the store. The store manger is awesome and willing to work with you.co-workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of your job is making people happy all the time. I enjoyed learning new things and working with the people."
good,I enjoyed this job because I loved the culture of the employees. It was constantly changing and there was always upbeat attitudes from the employees. I believe it was a positive work place and the management treated everyone equally.
good,"Fast paced and rewarding. I advanced rapidly and was verbally rewarded by management. Working conditions were excellent and I liked and got along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the quick turnaround of co-workers and diverse attitudes among some co-workers regarding the company, squabbling and favoritism. As a whole I enjoyed my work and did it well. I learned a great deal about retail customer service."
good,Overall great place to work. Would always a cranky customer or two but you get that anywhere! Very fasted paced at times made the day go fast.
good,Started out in deli and advance fast went to cash office then they restructured and only had one person in cash office. I moved to the electronics and then to support manager on graveyard shift. Great place to work nice friendly co workers but management needs some compassion and understanding we have lives.
good,"I can do any of the following on any given day:"
good,A typical day at work would include interacting with customers and processing their transactions. I found this to be very enjoyable as I would meet new people daily and enjoyed helping them.
good,"Although upper management wanted us to work on our own, our supervisors was always there to help. A typical day at work involved helping customers, stocking inventory, and accountability of inventory."
good,The typical day was not stressful. You will learn valuable people skills in this environment. The management was empathetic and reasonable and the co-workers were generally nice. The hardest part of the job would be your income. You will not make enough to make ends meet without another job or some form of assistance. The most enjoyable part was the ease of work. It was a very easy place to work for me. I enjoyed that part.
good,"Good place for promotion, management was very disrespectful , love co-worker. Pay scales wasn't that great"
good,long days and not knowing if you'll be employeed at rhe end of the day.
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart unloading trucks,stocking merchandise, store recovery and giving great customer service. I learned how to use a hand held computer,do inventory,and set modulers.I loved working my management and co-workers. I like having the sundown rule.The hardest part of the job was keeping certain merchandise on the shelf and explaning to the customer why it's not there.The best part of my job was serving the customer."
good,"a typical day at work involved handling multiple customers with answering questions or finding merchandise location within store."
good,not a great job. low pay no raises. plenty of hours no overtime.
good,"I loved working retail, management was great. I enjoy the walmart culture"
good,wal mart is a great place to work with all the changes since sam Walton died the ideas that have come down from the home office are not customer friendly it is more important to have a clean backroom than a full sales floor.  The store Is run with a skeleton crew and being a grocery store it needs to be staffed and kept full otherwise we are doing our customers a disservice.   it is more important to make a score card come in than to do the right thing.  I enjoy working at walmart and I know that I am not the only one that feels that way but it is the direction for now that the company is going.
good,the wal mart corporation is a large business and doesn't have much time to take care of there employees
good,"The best part of working walmart is the other employees.  I learned a lot about how bigger corporations work.  I also learned a lot about loopholes in their benefits systems and scheduling, as well as handbook.  Walmart appears to have great opportunities for their employees as long as their employees follow their guidelines without taking logic or moral compass into effect."
good,Really enjoyed being a cashier and grocery clerk in the same store. I  would have to say standing for great lengths at times was tough but what I liked more than anything was customer service.
good,"I Would Like To Say Every store is different, the store was a great place to work but not that worker friendly when it came to hours, besides that everything was good."
good,"Awesome employees to work with, I worked in the garden center so I got to work with plants and learned different things about plants and pesticides. Management is excellent when you can get ahold of a manager because they are always on the move and making the work environment a better place."
good,working at wal mart was very day to day.  I enjoyed being busy there. My main problem with this positions is the scheduling manager would change your schedules with out notice; also they would schedule you one day for 8 hours and then the next for 2. Lack of discussion with  upper management.
good,It was a seasonal position. The people was nice. Very busy. The management was understanding. The hardest part of the job was I always closed so I wouldn't be home to put me children to bed.
good,I liked the fact that their was a lot of customer service just hated the fact that the managers where on different pages and the workers would get yelled at for it and made coming to work less enjoyable and more aggravating
good,working at WalMart is a very fast past job and i enjoyed being there
good,I enjoyed my time working with Walmart. They kept me on my feet in a fast paced environment where I could gain work experience and great bonds.
good,"I liked that WalMart worked around my class schedule, but they didn't exactly give me a lot of expectations when it came to a raise in pay. At the time, they were looking forward to moving to the bigger building down the road. I wasn't in their future. They intended on letting me go with the extra holiday help. When I got word of that plan, I decided it was best to leave instead of be released."
good,Good hard work. Cant go worth with that but the wage they start you at for the type of work is not that great.
good,very productive for me though co-workers would slack and look for help. Management wouldn't mimimize work load for the over productive but would for the under determined. The most difficult part would be picking up other depatments slack. When the most enjoyable part was interact with the customers.
good,"Excelente, buen clima de trabajo. "
good,"I learned how to be apart of a team in a large environment."
good,Place new products on shelves.  Help customers find items they wish.  Keep alert for shoplifters.  Keep store clean.
good,Fast paced in pulling pallets to sales floor to work freight onto shelves in a timely manner. I have learned to communicate with coworkers and customers and also with managers. The managers communicate fairly to associates but some times drop the ball. My coworkers show a lot of respect and a lot of team work to help others to finish up the departments. The hardest part of my job is multi-taking numerous departments. But I find a way to overcome the situation and get it done. I enjoying meeting new people day in and day out. I have a lot of satisfaction in helping out customers and knowing that they have left my store with a smile.
good,"Assisiting customers with their needs and wants "
good,"My day consist of oil changes and tires, during down time we will clean the shop and organize the tools."
good,"A typical day at Walmart, is like most other cashier jobs. If wanting an honest Opinion, Walmart has its pros and cons. The pros is that they don't fire you, unless you did something very stupid. A con is that the management wasn't always on the same page. One would tell you one thing, while another would tell you different. Lastly, not all the managers knew what they were doing. I had only been working there a month and was still learning how to run a till and had a manager ask me what to do. All I could think was; ""seriously""."
good,I typically deal with customers on a daily basis. I work hard to make sure they have the best experience and their medication is right.
good,it was pretty good working their but not 100 % satisfied. I called in because of an emergency but the customer service lady did not pass my message to my manager so it was a serious trouble for me
good,I had to leave because it was difficult to balance two jobs at one time
good,"Good place to work "
good,Well from other companies this one is one of the largest offering a stable and good schedule for those single mom.  Benefits are good not excellent but good.
good,"Working in Produce I had a great time as a sales associate for Wal-Mart. The environment was not physically or mentally demanding and pretty easy and repetitive routine work. Unload pallets when trucks arrive, stock shelves, and write down losses if produce goes bad. Management was great and always went out of their way to make things a little more fun and exciting. The coworkers however were consistently negative and always found somethings to be upset about with their job. This job is very easy to trap yourself into because it does not offer a challenge. However their is career advancement opportunity if you take the time to go to school while no working."
good,"working in electronics was a fun time seeing all new movies, games, and products coming to the floor and letting customers know what best would suit their needs."
good,"Working in management at a large retail store can be quite exciting.  Maintaining and turning close to $5 million in inventory has unique challenges, especially dealing with unruly customers.  This business helps you develop in customer and employee needs, finding solutions for challenging problems.  The salary is very generous for the hours worked, a typical week is 48 hours spaced in 3 days on and 3 days off.  Also a college education is not necessary to promote to higher levels of management."
good,"I learned several different trades on my job. I learned cashier, stocking techniques, operating different types of equipment. My management team at times was hard to get answers from, and at time were difficult to find. The most enjoyable part about my job was helping people find the things they needed."
good,"* Very fast paced"
good,A empresa me deu a oportunidade de aprender outras funções fazendo com que eu pudesse expandir os meus conhecimentos aprendendo outras funções.
good,Being a cashier at Walmart is boring and tedious. My shifts felt like they would never end.
good,"Rotina de trabalho normal"
good,"Developing pictures and handling customers. Tends to be a little slow, but the rushes are pretty insane, especially without help."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, and employees.  The most difficult is management."
good,"Typical day is all based off of routines. The hardest part of the job is having the staffing to get the work done, the most enjoyable part of the job is when all management work together"
good,"Big company with great culture."
good,"Fast pace, always changing, very challenging. Nice people to work with, has a solid management staff."
good,"If it honestly wasn't for the people I work with and the management I'm under, I honestly would've not liked working there. Yes customers can be EXTREMELY rude or disrespectful, but at times you have to remember to not take it personal. Get bonuses every 3 months, so that's always a plus"
good,Unloading freight and making sure it get's stocked in the proper department. Taking care of every customer's needs and wants to ensure a great shopping experience. Teach and train others to perform duties in departments to get the job done in time frame to meet deadlines. Being in management the team is very helpful in keeping the store running smooth. The biggest challenge is to keep to provide the best customer service possible to stand above the rest. Meeting new people every single day and helping  them find what they need is the best part of the day.
good,I liked being a cashier because of the people you meet I did like working there but it was too far from my house and u have to be there a year before you can transfer to another store.
good,Typical day at work would be smooth and easy. I learned how to work cash registers and stock. Management and co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was during holidays when the stores were packed but everything about the job was enjoyable.
good,My typical day at Wal-Mart was fast pace.   I enjoyed working  as a  team because co-workers and management were always willing to help if needed.  The hardest part of the job was when there was not enough cashiers to help out the customers.  I enjoyed  when I actually brought a smile to a customers face.
good,"I was nineteen when I worked for Wal-Mart. The managers were helpful, not too intense. The co-workers were friendly and very welcoming to me when I first arrived. The hardest part of the job is when everyone that works with you in your department called in except you. You would be responsible for everything in that particular department unless management brings someone over from another department to lend you assistance. The most enjoyable part of a job is clocking out, and going home knowing that all the hard work that you did for the day, payed off."
good,"It was a good job, easy to learn. Cashiering could be tedious due to systems going down and creating very large lines. Management was nice and made easy schedules."
good,"clock in and go to your register, open cash drawer, get busy. They have continuing ed for new policies in the form of meetings, not always on top to make sure everyone knows. A lot is word of mouth. Pretty much all cashiers are good at what they do, most of the mgrs are too, although I would speak to some of them. The hardest part is spring break and when mgrs forget to give you your lunch or your break. The best part is the customers you see every day and get to know them"
good,a typical day at work was going to work and completing all of my tasks to the best of my ability for the growth and prosperity of the company.
good,company is good but some of there management need to improve
good,"-the management was reasonable but strict."
good,dont pay much but its good place to work easy to move up in the company
good,"As an ASM you understand that Walmart is a company where you can definitely move up if you are willing to put in the time and are a great worker.  You also learn quickly that there is a large difference between hard and good work.  It took me a few months to learn the position but once that happened I went from always working hard, to working hard and smart.  This meant better results, taking less time.  I had amazing co-workers which made it hard to leave, but it was an experience I will always value.  I left to pursue other interests."
good,"stocking ,binning. every thing were good.I learned how bin.There were any hard part at my job."
good,"It was a wonderful job to me I love going to work every morning, but as the years went passed things begin to change with the values of their employees.  I learned that you have to work hard for success, and if you do not have opportunities available then work harder or keep trying.  The hardest part of the job was working with a large volume of customers by myself.  I worked well with my co-workers when they was scheduled."
good,"A typical work day consisted of helping customers at check-out, providing friendly customer service, checking prices when needed, applying discounts if needed, making sure customers gets through line in a timely manner. Management was excellent. I became a back-up manager my last couple of months working at Walmart and was a great experience being able to help the cashiers with register problems or customer concerns, and providing cashiers with money. Co-workers were great, loved them all. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,"I enjoyed Working for this company. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, I also liked working with the public and customers."
good,free range to do what you need to do as long as you get the work done the way they ask.
good,"Great job, good people and room for a lot of advancement. Great training programs"
good,"Un día normal en mi trabajo constaba de diversas actividades, desde contar morraya y separarla para un uso más fácil, hasta el cobro de mercancía, atención al cliente, recibo de pagos de servicio, manejo de efectivo, acomodo de mercancía en tiempo muerto etc. "
good,"Management slacked, day to day operations went pretty good."
good,typical day is to cash out all customers and begin stocking to shelves.
good,"A typical day at you have to be working, whether it's down stacking grocery to putting up freight or zoning."
good,I like my co workers and I got along with the mangers and co worker great but the mangers do need to work on there communication skills with the workers.
good,"Salários base de oitocentos e novecentos reais, nem todas tinhão benefícios, mas as que tinhão eram bons, na maioria não tinha muita   chance de promoção."
good,"A typical day is a meeting at 8:00 everyday to go over what is in store for today, what freight needs to be worked, price changes and other items. I have learned to use a large number of merchandising equipment and a lot about merchandising. I am the manager for homelines and give directons to the associates working under me. I get along well with all of the associates. The hardest part of my job is leaving for the day, Making sure all assigned work is done. I enjoy being able to give directions and seeing the work completed."
good,Every day there is something different at Walmart. You get the unhappy customers and its hard to deal with them when you have such a busy store and you want to help everyone at an appropriate time. I try my best to get my customers out of the line as soon as possible but sometimes its hard when your upper management is also very busy. Our co workers all work efficiently with each other and try to get our job done as professionally as possible. The most rewarding part is when your customers thanks you and tells you you've been great help and takes the time to let your manager or supervisor know.
good,"Those of us in the Bakery had a great teamwork in place.  We all had our own jobs but in times of high volume output, we pitched in and helped each other.  One such instance is during holiday times, we help the Cake Decorator with decorating cases of cupcakes, while she is busy decorating cakes, and helping customers."
good,a typical day at work involved me doing all the tasks I was appointed to that very day by my area manager after that I zoned till i was off. I learned plenty while working there like time management as well as being a cashier and a stock man. My co-workers were possibly the most enjoyable part of my job they were always there to help and teach me new things. the hardest part of my job was avoiding overtime considering we were not able to get any.
good,the overall rating was good and the vales was good to and the job security was oaky and the management was oaky at the time it was good life balance
good,management was to confusing to many people telling you what to do
good,Productive and fun workplace assisting the public with shopping decisions
good,most of the time I stocked grocerys all day I learned with working with the public that if your nice they remember you management some were super nice and some was not so nice coworkers super nice the best part was doing store remodels really fun
good,Typical Retail experience with many of opportunities to promote from within the organization. Long hours which are typical with retail management.
good,"I strongly enjoy the fast pasted environment, the customers and me know very well the products we carry"
good,"By working for this pharmacy for over a year now, it has taught me more than any textbook could on the field of pharmaceuticals. I have learned everything that I know about pharmaceuticals from day to day tasks. There is a lack of professionalism at this pharmacy though. It is quite embarrassing having to explain to patients why other employees and management are out of control. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with each of the patients, good and bad, and learning daily of new medications and their uses. The most difficult part of my job is like previously mentioned, lack of management and professionalism. I do not have an issue dealing with even the most difficult of patients."
good,Wonderful employees and customer.  Over all great places to work.
good,"I loved working here and the people were awesome."
good,I like to shop at walmart and all their products. The store is very clean and the associates are helpful.
good,This was a good job. I enjoyed helping customers and meeting people this job was never boring and the work was not hard. Management was ok. The hardest part about the job was sometimes you couldn't get work done because customers needed constant assistant.
good,I think that a few bad apples will spoil the whole bunch. You can have a few members of management that will make you hate to go to work when they are there but I'm sure that's mostly every place. The hardest part of the job is that it's retail and they demand more your life than you would prefer to give in most cases.
good,"A typical day at work would be going in and having a pallet full of merchandise, reading the serial numbers and putting them where they belong. I learned how to match products with the serial numbers and how to work with customers. I didn't have many co-workers with this volunteer job, but I often helped customers find what they were looking for on top of my job. The hardest part would have been the quantity of what I had to do in a days work. The most enjoyable part would have been helping the customers."
good,Production is very difficult to meet by some associates. I did very well in identifying shortcuts and better ways to improve speed and accuracy. Worked with everyone helping when they had a problem or difficulty and helping solve all issues. Started line and made sure it ran and was functioning properly all day to keep freight moving. Verified incoming and outgoing trailers. The hardest part was all the chaos and stress and pressure put on because of the high expectations. The best part was always being able to help others in some way. I did management responibilities continuously.
good,"I would show up to work 15 minutes early, clock in, then start putting pallets down. After all the pallets have been placed down we ( all the unloaders ) would open the truck and start unloading. After the truck is finished, we had to sort clothes then pull all the full pallets to the floor to be worked. Then normally I had to do picks, which is a Gemini telling you which boxes need to be put on the floor. Then after the boxes are put where they go, the floor needed to be swept, and then clock out."
good,"Being a maintenance Tech put me in all departments and I got to deal with all kinds of people and thats what I love, so it was fun. Don't get me wrong there as you know, were draw backs, which don't need more than your imagination to figure out, because the title says it all. Over all , I'll took the good with the bad and made it a fun time."
good,"10 hrs day "
good,"Busy busy, with lots of time limits, and trying to get work done in the time limit."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be waking up and getting ready for my day. Start work by working on the registers and helping customers with finding anything they needed."
good,"A typical day a work i arrive at work around 9:45 clock in about 9:55. Once that's done i go to the hub and click into my task. Then i go to get buggies, bring them to my department then unload my frat and put it away. I've learned how to use a cash register and break down frat.My managers were great leaders they kept the team together, one a cord. my co-workers were good some not so good but i stayed with a smile on my face. i would say taking the plastic off the merchandise was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of my day is making customers happy."
good,"Great place to work if you dont have a family, good for a student."
good,I work hard all day but make it fun for employee to work and implement company policices
good,"The hardest part of the job would be when customers would come in to return merchandise that was not refundable. Also, when they begin to accuse that we had fault with the service. Of course, we try to accommodate to their request, but a lot of customers would lie. It happened on a regular basis. I feel as if a lot of people abuse the policies of Walmart. Walmart tends to give refunds for mostly everything. Co workers were ok, some were arrogant, but i tried to make the best of my work environment. I learned to have patience with customers. Patience is the best way to win them over. I was able to provide excellent customer service just by listening to their demands and fulfilling their needs."
good,"Had good training on the jobs I did.  Management was good."
good,"Multi-tasking gives me the opportunity to learn other line of work. Aside from working in my department, I get to be a phone operator and from time to time assist in other departments like shoes and apparel."
good,"I start my day in claims by getting everything off the floor, plenty for recalls; both venders and return center. I clean package and ship about 7 pallets a week . I put merchandise on file; fix on hands;and deal with about 20 Dept. Mgrs. I work with management on compliance issues shrink and suppliers. I have learned to deal with many personalities; fulfill the needs of everyone I come in contact with. Wal mart is a company where you can excel if you have the desire, many hard working associates; team players."
good,The hardest part of the job is the heat inside the warehouse.  It is hard t maintain a productive pace at times.  The people that work at my DC are friendly and welcoming to everyone.
good,"For retail the pay was good, no problems with this company"
good,"I worked in 8 different departments, all satisfactory.  The associates I worked with were great!  That part I miss.  As with most places, the problem was with the management.  They push too much for the bottom line; $$$$$.  It's unfortunate.  Even the middle management is OK.  The trickle down theory applies and, of course, usually insisting on unrealistic goals."
good,Got to work 15 minutes everyday early. Kept my department clean and stocked at all times. Helped other co-workers with their department also. Stocked and worked in the warehouse when needed.
good,I liked working for Walmart although they were not able to keep me with enough hours each week.
good,I loved taking care of the customers and meeting new people.
good,"Managers and staff are just like any other managers and staff, some are good, some are bad."
good,"In all my years of working at Wal-Mart, I've seen even the best of associates and managers leave under the stress of the job. I personally just don't let things such as that get to me. Besides being stressed out on the job, it does have it benefits. I enjoy the 14% off on my phone bill as well as items in Wal-Mart. The paid vacation is perhaps the best way to escape work as well as to get paid for it."
good,Managing operations at walmart is a very beneficial experience.  You are able to work with the staff to deliver excellent customer service.  Learning the needs of your community and working to deliver is fulfilling assignment as well.
good,This work environment taught me a lot. Taking care of the customers is always first. my day would consist of stocking the shelves while taking care of the customers needs. My coworkers and I worked very well together to get the job done. Management always took care of my needs.
good,Good team of co-workers. I liked the work I was doing but I felt stuck in my position because lack of advancement opportunities.
good,Pretty friendly place to work . management was never to be found when you needed them thought. good coworkers. ok pay for starting out.
good,Cashiering handling customers as they check out. Management was understanding. My co workers were not all friendly. Overall its was enjoyable.
good,"A typical work day depended on what shift one was given. When I worked there, I normally cooked. Each item on the hot bar had a specific time it was pulled, weighed up, and thrown away. Once the time was getting close, one would recook the specific item and replace it. Also, we loaded and unloaded the rotisserie oven. We packaged and placed the hot chickens out for customers while chilling the older chickens so they were able to be bought with EBT. Customer service was a large part of the job. We would serve the customers at the hot bar, but also on the slicing side.  We would get the order, and fill it promptly.  As well as cooking or serving the food, we would prepare the food for the store. We made sandwiches, salads, lavash, and wraps. These items were made throughout the day for the cases and as backup for the next day."
good,"I have fun working as a cashier, I get to meet new exciting people every single day. My co-workers are generally very accomodating and understanding, we all help each other. The hardest part of my job is standing long hours and continously scanning products which can give enormous sholder and back aches."
good,"Re-stock store shelves, front cashier as needed, creating new end cap models, counting shipments. How to work with difficult customers, how to manage 1-2 employees. There where quite a few co-workers the ones worked with on a regular basis were friendly. The hardest part of work would sometimes be the upset customers."
good,"aprendi a lidar com diferenças, a dar treinamentos para grandes grupos."
good,"Typical day, I come in and clock in, check the sales floor for what needs to be filled or cleaned, go to the back room and cooler, pull the product I need out, put it on a cart, work it to the floor, helping customers with whatever they may need, and that goes on most of the day. towards the end of the shift I would spray the backroom floor with cleaner and then squeejee the cleaner into the drains. If at any time there was a mechanical question about any of the equipment in the back room or on the sales floor the associates would ask me for help before any others."
good,"Not interested in going into detail.  Very hard work.  Managers"
good,This is a good job but not a long term place to work. I would like to work with more of a team.
good,"•	Unloaded shipment pallets from trucks"
good,It's an enjoyable place to work - with other associates. Like I said before the wheels move very slow within the company to make changes. It sometimes appears that concerns fall on deaf ears via the mgmt.
good,"*Unload freight onto pallets "
good,"Usually worked weekends and one shift during the week, about 20 hrs each week."
good,"Overall the employment at WalMart was satisfactoryuntil minor then major procedure changes starting resulting in injuries, cut hours, no training for positions and finally management not making an effort to improve the overall condition of the store. we worked hard in a very large deli/hot food area. as a team. All of my coworkers   shared one goal-customer care. Hardest part of the job was the extensive setup and shutdown of the department especially since WalMart sets exact time frames for tasks to be completed regardless of conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and the satisfaction of our customers."
good,A typical day at work was exhausting due to laziness of coworkers.  Learned how to work at a timely safe manner in a fast paced environment with skilled and unskilled team members which taught me patience. Management team at times seemed effortless to resolve problems in a timely manner. Waited for problems to escalate before addressing them. The most difficult part of the job was the unawareness of workloads at the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunities to become manager and the pay.
good,"My position was at the Courtesy Desk and I really enjoyed it. There were times when I had to deal with irate customers but I just handled the situation as best I could. I liked working there but, Walmart being such a ""hustle and bustle"" business, there was not much of an employee - employer atmosphere."
good,"Typical day at work is mainly putting away freight and putting the boxes into a bailer. Help customers at the counter with either writing up services and driving the vehicles in to the shop, checking someone out at the register, or answering phone calls."
good,I can honestly say that I learned how to ignore rude comments and how to provide excellent customer service to customers.
good,"Walmart gave me financial stability, with reliable hours."
good,"- Cashiering, sales, call systems/secretary, organization, merchandizing, stocking."
good,"Aprendi no dia a dia a ser cada vez mais dinâmica, realizando várias tarefas ao mesmo tempo, a liderar, inclusive teve um dia bem complicado, onde precisei dar uma ordem todas as operadoras um trabalho a realizar, vindo da gerência, porém, elas se revoltaram contra mim que também só estava cumprindo ordens, tive que manter a calma, resolver sozinha e explicar com uma certa autoridade, mas de uma forma tranquila que todas nós temos que aprender a respeitar a hierarquia, a sermos disciplinadas, assim como eu respeitava meus líderes, elas tinham que me respeitar e que nós dividiríamos as tarefas da melhor maneira possível, pois somos uma equipe. Consegui reverter a situação, tudo se resolveu e elas capricharam, a parte difícil é essa, manter a calma, mesmo quando você não é culpado e quando eu poderia aplicar uma orientação pra melhoria, que lá na empresa isso é uma punição e nesse caso por má conduta e desrespeito, optei em usar o bom senso a comunicação e dar o exemplo executando aquela tarefa junto com elas, e isso é muito prazeroso, conquistar o respeito de outros de uma forma madura e profissional, ao invés de puni-las."
good,"At first they took advantage of their workers but that gradually improved.  I liked the enthusiasim of employess and the morning meetings and cheers.  Many qualified people worked for Wal-Mart but I fear that as the company grew they got farther and farther away from Sam Walton's vision, but the employees did get better pay."
good,"I really loved my job, I loved feeling as if I was a part of a team. I loved dressing up my uniform to show I took pride in making it to work everyday and being able to serve the customers. I loved loved loved conversing with the customers and finding out how they like what ever random product that came down the line. If it something I never seen before I'll ask what it was, how do you use it, and what is it for. If it was something I was familiar with I would definitely give honest feedback on how I loved the product or offer an alternative. No one wants to waste time, money, or effort so if I can help save any of that then, why not? I would always know when something was on sale, not because of co-workers but because the customers. Depending on their mood, they would burst with excitement because they found a product they love on sale. Yes, the simple joys of being a server of the customer."
good,I was an overnight stocker I had to stock pallets full of merchandise on shelves and then facing the merchandise with all labels facing the same way. Overnight hours are from 10 pm tp 7am. Pay rate is okay especially overnights you get that dollar raise.
good,would arrive for closing hour. Picked up returns and put them back in place. Clean my working area. Help with costumers. And help my fellow associates in their work area.
good,i was a high school student when i started working in Wal-Mart. so i use to work Mon. Wed. Thurs. Fri.Sat. from 4:30 pm. to 11:30 pm. i learned how to be responsible. i learn how to communicate with people well. to help customers in anything they needed. i learn how to work a cash register. i had good co-workers helping me if i was in need of help....
good,"Working at Wal-Mart helped me to become familiar with the values of customers when they are shopping. The environment of the company is that all of us (associates) are family, therefore making the average work day even more enjoyable."
good,"worked in many departments during the years at the store.  I learned to stock, use telezons, register, inventory managing, cut fabrics, bakery equipment, the respect for the customers and fellow associates. I learned that making customers having the items that is needed make them return.  Hardest part of the job was staying in the freeze for long period of times.  Management changed many times while I was with the company.  Not all thinking the same management style was a little stressful but I adjusted to them as best as possible."
good,The hardest part of job was stocking in frozen foods section. The most enjoyable  part was stocking new tools or other new hardware items that came in.
good,It could be busy at times and very slow at times.  The conversations you had with the customers as you were scanning there food made the time go by fast.  Walmart doesn't really care what you have going on in life with your kids or family if they are not in the hospital it is not important.
good,walmart is a fun place to work. i enjoy working with customers because i have excellent customer service skills.
good,great place to work and my co-workers were great and the customers were great
good,many task during the day. Enjoy being around people and helping people out. I get along great with my manager and co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be remembering what all the medications are used for. Most enjoyable part is working and being around all the people. Im a people person.
good,I learned a lot about my self and about others why working as a Store Standard at Wal-Mart.
good,stay busy have good customer service do your job right and on time
good,"Unload truck on time while being organized, break packs, distribute merchandise to the floor in right departments, pick and bin products in departments that are needed. Handle anything else the store needs."
good,Could be more organized. Should have more respect for others.
good,"When Walmart was at a slow point of the day,we used to race to get the first customer,because the one with the most customers would probably have the highest IPH at the end of the day.AT the end of four  weeks the person with the highest IPH would get a raise and be announced in the morning meeting.Everybody would be congratulating you,and that would make you feel really good about yourself and your job performance."
good,"Management didnt know how to talk to people. Customers and employees often complained about rude behavior from management."
good,we worked hard but i worked with good people so made the night go faster and we somes help each other i liked that about workin here.
good,unloading trucks learned all aspects of retail management was not always supporative  co workers where great hardest part of the job was trying to finish work in a timely manner when there were numerous call offs in department   most enjoyable was the people
good,I learned how to work with the public at this job. There were many trainings and advancement's. I was still in high school when I started working as a photo tech and I enjoyed my job. They worked around my school schedule.
good,Ring up customer merchandise.  I learned how to work fast. The managers were good people to work with also my co-workers. I enjoyed working for wal-mart cause i got to meet new people.
good,I loved working at Walmart. It was a great experience and I met so many wonderful co-workers and friends. I loved the management team so much!
good,"A typical day at work was always enjoyable. I learned how to run the register stock shelves. My management always made things fun. My coworkers were always there for me and made me feel welcome. Hardest part of my job was working with the negative customers, but i always tried to make them smile. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers and making sure their shopping experience was the best it could have been."
good,"This job was not the best I have ever had, but it's not the worst. You came to work, did your job, and went home. Management at the time did not really care much, they would just walk around and make sure you were working, and then go back to the stock room. Co-workers were very friendly, and days went by pretty quick because you were always busy."
good,I worked over night and in furniture and housewares. sometime if area was slow you had to help with area that was on demand. I learned to help others without them asking for it. Co workers was nice not the family level though. Hardest part of job is working overnight I am a morning  person. the most enjoyable is discount from working there.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart however, I need more consistent hours."
good,Good co-worker; management is the only problem. no hard parts during the job the only boring part is cbl. the most enjoyable part is talking to the customers.
good,"This was my second time as an employee at Walmart. The company itself is okay. However, the individual locations have cultures that may not necessarily align with the company values. However, I believe any job is what you make it. The attitude that you bring with you to work is what most determines how your day will turn out."
good,"I would clock in on time 7am.I would get a telzon & printer. Head back to the backroom grab a elcart to put my freight on & a pallet jack, go to the freezer see what I got from last nights freight pull the pallet out rework all product. What product wouldn't go out I would tag & bin in the steel, if comac came in I would tag & bin all product. Climb a up ladder in the freezer & place the product in the steel. I would do picks, its where you go on a screen on your telzon all your product that needs to go out will show, you then scan the barcode on the product & pull it from the bin. Then you go to the next one & so forth. Got along great w/ coworkers my assistant was always happy w/ my performance."
good,"Great place to work."
good,I worked at Walmart as a people greeter then was promoted to cashier. This is where I learned a lot of my customer service skills. Walmart really helped me be very patient with people and learn how to handle money and cash checks as well. The front end supervisors were very helpful training me. 
good,"1° trabalho, muito bom trabalhar no nacional amadureci e aprendi bastante cm eles"
good,Its a job and I do it because I have a family to feed. There's no hard part about the job. The thing that I dislike the most about the job are the hours.
good,Our world is all about change and Walmart embraces this culture daily. Every day was a new challenge so I learned quickly to become adaptable/flexible in my daily role. I made many friends and still am close w/my Walmart family. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers achieving the results they were looking for and the positive feedback I received thru repeat customers.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place for someone with no ties.  You never knew what your schedule would be and you could not count on the same amount of hours every week, made it very hard to take care of monthly monetary responsibilities."
good,"Learned the value of customer service, but I really didn't have a good experience working here. The management was not structured and they were not very trustworthy. "
good,"Todos los días son muy parecidos en este trabajo, es llegar y ver que es lo que falta en las góndolas y reponer lo faltante, a medio turno un descanso de media hora y luego a seguir reponiendo mercadería."
good,"A great enviorment for customer and workers to interact . The daily activities consisted of many things . We started off the night with a group meeting to talk about the tasks for the night . Management was great, they helped us if we got busy and we always communicated to keep up with the work night. The job was always enjoyable and nothing at all was hard it was a task that needed to be completed and I always got the job done."
good,"a typical day at work begins with scanning your badge and reviewing your assigned tasks, heavy on customer service, speed of work and increasing work loads."
good,I was told that my job was a full time job and was let go 2 months later saying it was seasonal I didnt appreciate that other then that very nice place to work. 
good,great company with great benefits but makes it very difficult to keep your job or advance unless you started as an hourly associate in the stores.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart because the typical day at wrok was fun and enjoyable because of the other associates with whom I worked with. I learned to be more confident in myself as well as more agressive in learning new things all the time. The management was pretty good, they were understanding if someone had something going on in their lives outside of work. My co-workers were the best! They were fun and upbeat and just overall fun  to work with! The hardest part of my job was at times I would be in a situation where I would not have all the required knowledge to perform the task at hand, so I would find a department manager somewhere around where I was working and learn from them. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart was meeting new people."
good,"Working overnights goes by super fast, so that was nice. If you are full time you can get a set schedule which is nice to be able to plan around when needed. "
good,"At WalMart you get to meet all kind of people.  You have some group work, busy work, and multitasking work.  The work flow is always changing depending on customer flow, associate call outs, and holidays including the 1st and 15th of every month. It is fun teaching new associates and management the retail experience. WalMart makes you become very adaptable to change. It is fun as a manager to get input and ideas from other associates to help execute tasks  or projects."
good,My job was to oversee all frontend employees and help resolve customer complaints.
good,"I worked with cashiers to be sure they had everything they needed to do their job.  I scheduled breaks, brought them change, handled problems and made sure customers were our number one focus.  I learned to keep everyone calm and keep everyone happy.  Management basically stayed out of my way.  I never really saw them unless I needed them. I liked most of my co-workers.  I do have a better work effort than most.  I did enjoy working with an assortment of personality types."
good,"Llegas, fichas, vas a buscar el monedero para empezar a trabajar. Cuando es el horario de comida, alguien te viene a reemplazar, retiras el dinero lo dejas en caja central en donde te entregan una llave y después de 30 minutos se vuelve a buscar, en ese momento te asignan una caja hasta finalizar el trabajo. Cuando cumpliste con el horario retiras todas las perchas, alarmas y cosas que puedan quedar. Luego haces el arqueo de caja y cuando terminas fichas la salida."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is fun. Wal-Mart is a great company to work for but the need for me to work on there overnight team is not compatible for a permanent life style for me. I do love this company but with the rotation of working overnights ever other year is not where I see my future. This company has great structure, great ethics and great beliefs on how this company runs. It is a family environment and most associates like there jobs. Wal-Mart is a company that most people wish to work for, and I am proud to be apart of this team. I like my job I just do not wish to work the overnight scheduling needs on a consistent basis."
good,"High pace work ,managment good. I liked the co-workers i worked with."
good,Loved working there its a great place to work and grow i love dealing with people so i loved what i did i worked at the customer service desk so i dealt with alot of peolpe everyday and i never got frustrated cause i was their for them and i always try to make the customer happy after all without them we wouldnt have a job 
good," Would not work their again. Do not take care of employees. Hardest part, lifting 30 lb wheels to move shelves. VERY HARD, WHEN IN THEIR BOOK FOR EMPLOYEES IT SAYS, WE LIFT NO MORE THEN 20 LBS."
good,It was a good work experience everyday I learned something new and that made me grow.  I learned that you have to communicated to everyone and make sure that they understand what you have discussed before the comversation ends.  I love to interact with others; working with the public and co-workers is what I miss the most they were like family.
good,"I started working as PT lay-a-way help, with in 9 months I had been promoted from lay-a-way to cashier to electronics to customer service, then on to CSM (Customer service manager) before I moved out of state."
good,"zoning"
good,"Walmart had a Charity Fund account that I was allowed to work with and  distribute among charitable organizations thru out Monroe County. "
good,"excellent company,  great with the community and stays interactive with the consumer"
good,"Work was fun exciting I learned a lot of things I drove a fork lift, stock the shelves, unloaded the truck, an a lot other duties. The workers were great people they helped out a lot if I needed any."
good,"A typical day at work was dealing with customers making sure they are pleased with their experience at Wal-Mart . I have learned on how to interact in a friendly and courteous manner with our customers. Management was good to their employees, and my co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with customers that were not friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving bonuses every few months. And during Holidays when the store was very busy "
good,I had a blast working here despite the fact the pay was substandard. The team I worked with overnights was amazing. We stuck together and hung out. This had to have been one of my better jobs and I have had plenty. We made every effort to have fun and since I was the manager for night shift I ensured the front end personnel did just that. We got it all done every night and spared no laughs while doing it.
good,as a cashier i learned how to speak with customers and how to assist them. I had no problems with any of my co-workers or managers.
good,"Check for items that need to be stocked onto the shelf. check on customers and help them with purchases, cashier, water plants and cull dead plants, finish stocking shelves and clean up garden center and lock up for the night."
good,"o que você aprendeu:"
good,"A typical day at work includes various activities such as unloading trucks, separating freight in appropiate place, taking freight to the floor to be stocked, etc."
good,Very common to work long hours 70 to 80 hours a week. I moved on from Wal Mart to keep my family intact.
good,Some days I baked and some days I packaged and put product on the floor. We always provided customer service where needed. Learned to write on cakes and to bake in large quantities. The employees all got along.It was hard because your schedule always changed. I liked the accomplishment of a pretty baked product.
good,"My typical day at work would involve having a safety meeting with my department, and set goals for the day, and assign jobs. I learned how to work and supervise all different kinds of people, and handling all different types of customer complaints and challenges. My co-workers and I worked good as a team. The thing I liked most about this job was working with the public everyday."
good,"Retail will always have it's share of ups and downs as business is dictated by the consumer / economy.  However, having previously worked at a major competitor for four years, Walmart has been nothing short of impressive in terms of working toward keeping costs low for the consumer and providing a positive work environment for their associates.  A huge benefit outside their excellent healthcare package and associate profit-sharing program is Walmart's flexibility in attempting to meet the needs of associates outside of work, whereas Walmart appears to try to schedule around a person's life outside of work as long as the associate makes reasonable requests within a reasonable period of time.  In many respects, management goes above and beyond in their attempts to provide associates with a work schedule which maximizes availability while further attempting to minimize disruptions outside of work."
good,"Typical work day would be customer service, completing reports, meetings, freight, and delegating jobs for the employees. The job was enjoyable, but yet very stressful. Walmart expects way too much from their employees, with a staff that is minimal, the jobs are very demanding on one or two people in a dept to handle along with always being called from your dept. to cashier."
good,it was like a family. everybody worked together. security good. its a place to go up.
good,"Walmart was not a good place for me. I tried my best, and I gave up on working at walmart. I have moved on, and grew up now. "
good,"a typical day at work was very rewarding, what i learned was to satisfy the customers with a simple smile , the management"
good,"everyone i worked with was always nice and friendly , i learned customer service is number one."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart and was there for nearly 2 years. My only complaint is that I kept trying to become a customer service rep, I was a cashier, and because I was so fast on the register they told me they could not afford to train me for customer service. So it was almost like being punished for being good at my job. Other than that it was not a bad company to work for. There are even some health benefits for part time employees. People applying should be aware that due to high turn over rates they almost never hire any one full-time right off the bat, but if you let them know you want full time and show the effort they will get you there."
good," A empresa muito boa aprendi muito trabalhando na mesma, foi ótimo."
good,"Wal-mart is based on not only individual performance but how well you work or communicate with peers. I do enjoy walmart but as far as opportunity to advance in the work place goes, it has become scarce over the years. I've seen mangers forced to step down afraid of termination and associates terminated for nothing. They barely have any full-time associates because they hire multiple temporary part time associates."
good,"Walmart helped give me a start in my working career. There are many opportunities for advancement for hard workers. Walmart teaches customer service and management skills. Even in my job today, my Walmart experience helps me! I would strongly suggest working for Walmart."
good,Started off as cashier eventually experienced every part of store! Co-workers were helpful. Management was easy to talk to. Recognized for my hard work. Breaks were important to management. Holidays were exhausting. Really enjoyed all the experienced gained. 
good,"Falta mas actualizar al empleado en su trabajo "
good,I learned how to handle big amount of cash. Management was good. Co workers was good. No hardest part. When customer compliments me `you are ever smiling person`
good,Management were very easy and great to get along with. Love being a customer service.
good,"A typical day for me, means clocking in at 10pm, gathering things need for the night, and stocking heavy cases of water all night."
good,"É uma empresa muito boa de se trabalhar,respeito ao associado e como eu disse tem um ecelente pla no de saude aos funcionario,alimentação por um preço bem menor..."
good,"The training i received at Wal-mart will never be forgotten. I learned the ins and outs of retail from a food point of view. I enjoyed sharing recipe ideas with the customers and giving them new products to try. My co-workers for the most part were hard working and dedicated to their job, and the management staff was a revolving door. The hardest part of the job....nothing was challenging. The best part was that with lifting so much all day i got to drop my gym membership."
good,Orientation covers the basics of a typical work day but they don't provide a lot of training to cover your specific area a head of time. I'm a hard worker so I sought out ways to use work resources to improves my skills. The management was always available. The hardest part of working here was you had to do a lot on your own but the most enjoyable part of the job was the fact you could always help customers on a daily basis. 
good,I love to Work as a cashier I am very good with the till and helping customers I go above and beyond to help them out. Walmart though did not pay enough also they never gave enough hours.
good,"Empresa muito boa de se de trabalhar com cultura forte de respeito ao indivíduo e aprendizado a longo prazo."
good,"The hardest part of the job was that fact that u are never off on any hoildays. "
good,Co-workers and management are pleasant.  Diversity of workers is nice.
good,"Team work thru out store, working with others to perform best work enviroment, management could of been more together"
good,"A typical day at work for me is opening up the store and zoning all my areas and then getting ready for that afternoon and evening rush. I learned that I may not be able to control everything but its handling it the best way you can to satisfy your customers needs to keep them coming back to buy more merchandises. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people all day and constantly learning new things. The hardest part about the job is when  you are not sure about certain questions the customer asks, but the great part about that is you have your wonderful co-workers and managers who know the answers. "
good,"Working on ICS was good, good job security and responsibility but when I went to Sporting Goods at another store it only lasted about 2 weeks in before I got coached for something that was not even my area, then I noticed how sloppy the management was and how they like to have power trips where they order you around like your a slave and they will stand around and talk but the second you talk to another employee they snap at you. One thing I also hated was that they liked to multitask everyone so to get out of hiring a cart person they would call the male and ONLY the male associates on the floor to come get them instead of having one of the cashiers that wasn't busy going to get them. If me or a coworker was called we would have to come all the way from the back corner of the store, leaving our area without anyone to help customers which customers did not like one bit. I was happy to help but after about a month or two they started doing it all the time and I felt they did it just to get out of having to do it themselves and it also takes me or another associate away from their job which hurts customer service. When I expressed my concerns to management it was met with no action."
good,"Everyday is constructive and a fun workplace. All associates get along and counteract with each other very well. Associates and management can maintain a sociable relationship while in the workplace. We do are best to make sure that whatever is needed for the customer can be provided. the job is fairly easy, but it can become tiresome to the body after a couple of hours, but nothing that any other job wouldn't do. The best thing i like about working at Walmart is being around a vast variety of people daily, it allows you to stay interactive with people from the community and your constantly working with other associates as teammates.Overall, i think Walmart is a wonderful place to work."
good,Walmart can be a very hectic place some times it can be fun. The manager would be hard to contact and are mostly busy.
good,assisting guest with their prescription using cash register and computer.Our manager is so nice I was about to be trained to become a pharmacy tech if I stayed longer.My co-worker are very nice too and very helpful.The hardest part is when theres a problem about the guest's health insurance and I dnt know how to explain it because I wasnt fully trained about it and all the tech and pharmacist are busy and the guest is getting mad and impatient.The enjoyable part is I get to know more people and become friends with them.
good,"this job I was part of a remodel crew, it was fun, but why would you put women that are 50 in a remodel crew such as moving sheloves, and assembling them, I had fun with the challenge though and was able to complete the task. "
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar,as pessoas são muito amigas. por isso   trabalhei lá durante 4 anos."
good,"good benefits and they also work with your schedule, easy to move around"
good,"Its a good company to work with, but you recieve little pay for the work load."
good,"Customers come and go, but when a manager is need it seems to take forever."
good,"i really did have fun working there i had learn a lot from the people that i worked with"
good,I workd with customers managers wasnt good work was hard. I love it there but unorganized.
good,"This was a fun job, I was given directions at the beginning of my shift and left to do my job for the rest of the day with no interference from other people. I was in charge of stocking shelves and inventory control for my section of Wal-mart."
good,I really enjoy working here. The people I work with are great and make working fun.
good,"I have worked for Walmart for almost 3 years now and in that time I have been able to advance in pay grade while learning several skills within the store. As a college student, working at Walmart is extremely beneficial because the company will work around your class schedule, or any given day you may need off. Management is fair and I have not once have a problem with a manager. I have moved several departments within the store by my own choice. Therefore, if you are uncomfortable in one department then management will help you find an area you like. "
good,"I would stock sporting goods and straighten up grocery."
good,"loved my job, flexible worked well with my family, easy to learn , loved my co workers and management, customers are my favorite part of the job always something new and exciting"
good,Overall working at Wal-Mart was good very respectful and enjoyable to work at.
good,"Came in and did your job. Unloading trucks, Inventory, stocking shelves."
good,This was my first job and I learned the importance of working and how to interact with others in a working enviroment. 
good,I love to be busy and work hard. Keeping all personal business outside of the office. I love to learn all duties at the office just in case help is needed in other departments I am always willing to lend a helping hand. The most enjoyable part of any job I have ever had is being able to meet new people and making a difference in someones life. Even if it is for a short time. Sometimes a smile is all it takes to brighten someones day.
good,"Coming to work on time and being punctual is very important part of any job not to mention Walmart employee. Making sure you got all the tools and knowledge thats going to help you, make your day easier. coming to your area making sure you look professional and you have smile on your face since the moment you walk in that door till you leave for the day. Attitude has to be nothing but positive. Making sure all the customers are being greeted politely and all the questions and concerns are being addressed. "
good,"What I like about Walmart is that it teaches you early on that you can do much better. I mean this as a compliment, as you will learn early as to whether you might want to advance further into management, or just plain go towards a different job. Retail in general is a hard job to get used to, but the people I work with and management know that and they're good people to work with."
good,"Job was informative on many levels, and it taught me very valuable skills as an employee. I would highly recommend this position to anyone looking for a good job for both part time and full time compensation."
good,"A typical day would consist of me and my co-workers"
good,"I've noticed with all Walmarts, once people are upgraded to management they turn into complete snobs. They rarely work with hours.  "
good,Greeted customer when entering the establishment. Operated cash register and issued receipts and correct change. Answered customer questions and resolve complaints. How to resolved conflicts the satisified everyone. Management and co-workers took the time to explain policies and producers and give you the extra help if need. Communicating the right information to the customer was the hardest and enjoyable part of the job.
good,aqui aprendi mucho empese como axiliar general alimentando estibando limpindo luego subi de puesto me dieron rapido mi planta a los 3 mesescomence a escaner despues fui tomada en cuenta para el area de sistemas y aprendi a configurr los escaner a entrar al sistema para asignar usuariosme gustaba mucho mi trabajo 
good,The job was good. You did not have to break your back to get done what needed to be done. Room for advancement but at a very slow and steady pace.
good,As a cashier checked out a lot of customers.  I learned how and how not to deal with the diversity of people.  Loved all parts of my position.
good,manage inventory in the store. also helped out unloading freight. i kept record of products going in and out the store.
good,"Wal mart is a fast place organization. At any time of day there are hundreds of people in the store. It is loud and busy, but that also keeps the place going. I learned how to temper my temper and bite my tongue (which is a very valuable lesson). I loved my co-workers and did not have any problems with them. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day and keeping your tongue when someone has a snarky comment about you or the company. I enjoyed meeting a variety of people."
good,"I work in a fast-pace job that is always dealing with high demand in patients. I multi-task all the time and do it quite well. I enjoy my current job however, I am looking for better hours due to my oldest getting ready to attend school this fall."
good,Its not a bad place to work steady income just not a very big one as an hourly associate.
good,Greet and checkout customers. Stock around my area. Fun fast paced place to work. everyone was very friendly.
good,I enjoy working for Walmart. the people that I have gotten the chance to work with are great individuals. The company was founded on great values and does its best to stay true to those values.
good,A great place to work over all. Teams are in place and they promote growth in the individual. Best first real job ever.
good,Management was good and the pay and hours were okay. I would work at this company again if I was looking for a part time position with a low stress level.
good,"Cuadrar la bóveda, entrega de prestamos a las cajeras, supervisar el área, archivar y mandar informes pertinentes, manejar los cambios de monedas y billetes que solicitan las cajeras, realizar retiros de dineros, autorizarlas y sacarlas a colación, recibir su recaudación al terminar el turno y cuadrar sus entregas, cuadrar y entregar bóveda a mi colega."
good,"I have enjoyed my time with the company. I have been there for 12 years and have learned so much when it comes to dealing with people. I have learned excellent customer service skills, management skills, and many other skills. My co-workers are great and I have built lasting friendships with some. The hardest part of the job is difficult people, but that is easily overcome."
good,I learned a lot while I was working. I had to take lots of complaints from customers and we were always short staff. Some of the managers had favoritism and they looked out for certain associates.
good,A typical day at work was busy and fast paced. I was lucky if I got to sit down for 30 min. I learned a lot about problem solving and time management. The management there was fair. Some where good and some would just not care. I loved some of my co workers. That's what made it easy to get up at 3 am to go to work. But there were some that would sleep at their desk and get away with breaking rules which I didn't like. The hardest part of my job would have been having to wake up at 3 am every morning and not know when I was going to get off that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I only worked 3 days a week.
good,Its a family work inviroment. It has a lot of opportunites for career changes.
good,I liked working here because it was a great place to challenge myself and learn new skills. Plus advance my customer service skills.
good,Clock in and go to my department to start stocking shelves and helping customers. I learned a lot about toys. Management was to busy caring about the overall store then to take time and care about the individual employee. The hardest thing about this job was trying to get your tasks done in your department when getting called to the registers every ten minutes. The most enjoyable part is working with customers and providing them with that special toy for there little one.
good,"A parte mais agradavel trabalho em equipe ,aprende muito na empresa ,me possibilito a conhecer novas areas e novos departamentos"
good,The company teaches striving beyond your expectations. Completing the daily tasks assigned is very important so that you are able to assist other departments as needed.
good,• Effective in stressful situations
good,I worked at this store before and loved it and the managers. This time the managers were not polite and forced us to do stuff that we shouldn't have been doing.
good,"Empresa que investe no colaborador, com culturas sólidas."
good,A normal day working at wal mart would consist of using a register and checking out customers in a timely fashion while providing great customer service. i learned a a lot about retail business. management changed all the time and each manager had different tactics and ways the wanted stuff done so it was difficult trying to keep changing what pace and details you show. Co-workers were fairly decent. a lot did not stay but the ones who did were great and i learned faster and new ways to get the work i needed to done. the hardest part of the job was holidays. the most enjoyable was meeting new people and having customers get to know you that they will always want to come to your line when at work.
good,"On a typical day, we have to make sure work is complete. We have 2 15 min. breaks, and an hour lunch break. We are all working together as a unit throughout the night."
good,"I learned fro m this job, how to maintain conversation, to have adequite and work in a timely fashon for the customers. The most enjoyable part ,was developing a 'bond' with customers, to where they would become 'regulars' at my register. Knowing that a friendly smile and be able to make a possitive impact on customers."
good,"Worked 8am to 8pm three days on and three days off. Did many aspects of the job from hiring to firing, schedules, paper work, and cash handling. Customer service good and bad."
good,"ambiente de trabalho muito bom, aprendi muito de medicamento e minha gestora me ensinou muito, a parte mais dificil foi o começo, eu não sabia nada e tive que me adapitar muito rapido por que estava sem funcionario para atender os clientes"
good,Good first job; wouldn't recommend staying there forever.
good,"llegar a walmart e ir directo a tu area de trabajo esto es en el caso de ser cajero, aprendes acerca de ventas, de como tratar a los clientes sin ser ten ensimoso."
good,Would handle the cash transactions on a day to day basis. Would usually be the last person that the people would talk to so i would always be nice.
good,I loved working at wal-wart because of my customers. Most of them were very nice and made it easy for me to do my job. The management wasn't the greatest but it was a job. The hardest part was management never agreeing on the same thing. It was so frustrating because we never knew what to do or say.
good,Management and co-workers were great but the job itself was very humbling and required alot of physical labor for 10 hours straight every night.
good,"I worked the overnight shift at Wal Mart, so I would be a cashier at the beginning of my shift. The second part of my shift I would stock merchandise and/or clean the front end of the store. Hardest part of working here was the overnight hours, trying to stay alert was very hard. I enjoyed interacting with all co-workers, from maintenance up to the management."
good,"Balance change alottment, Distibute change, Audit registers, initiate tasks to employees, customer service returns,complaints, purchases. communicate tasks with management,Reset registers, administrate breaks and lunches, Clean, Straighten and stock merchandise.

good,alot of friendly people and a great opportunity to grow from nothing up.
good,"fast pace, good feeling at end of day for work completed. team works good together."
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits with openings for advancement. Be prepared for long working hours as job advancement goes up This company even though large gives you the family feeling that people care."
good,"Wal-mart is a great place to work where one can interact with various sorts of people and work with a great team of co-workers. The hard part of the job was when the store was busy and not enough associates on the floor. This lead to customers becoming impatient and irritated and made the hours difficult. Apart from that, the work enviroment is very interactive and there is always something new to learn. Management is very flexible with work schedules providing that they get enough notice."
good,"Hola,la limpieza y siempre hay alguien a quien preguntar si hay alguna dudas"
good,loved meeting the customers and waiting on the customers needs
good,"I enjoyed working around all of customers, I enjoyed being a cashier and helping others"
good,A lot of different departments to work in and learn from. A good employer to advance in.
good,"El día comienza con el cierre de las aplicaciones y programas como el resumen de actividades diarias, cuadraje de efectivo, vales y Boucher que se reciben a diario al igual que el envió de valija. Todo me gusto del puesto, aprendí a detectar billetes falsos a simple vista entre otras cosas."
good,"Fast paced, unpredictable on HOURS, worked year around no hollidays off."
good,Estressante com cobrança desde o primeiro minuto de trabalho.
good,was a good job for the time while i found something better. got me started really in the customer service environment.
good,"I lived in a small town so they were very family oriented, if ever something happened in someones home life that required help the managers and other associates were very supportive and helpful."
good,Walmart over all is not a bad place to work. Our management people are approachable.
good,"I staged and distributed shopping carts as designated by self, preformed costumer services carry outs carry ins keeping lot cleared"
good,"On a typical work day, I cook food for sale, slice meat for customers, and clean all dishes, ovens, fryers, slicers, and floors when am closing."
good,"A fast pace working enviroment , dealing with 80k customers per week , controling and coaching my direct reports , dealing with a huge variety of issues and problem solving with customers and colleagues at many levels ."
good,Managed boys and menswear. Supervised five employees. Ordering and doing inventory. Price changes and working freight.
good,I enjoyed the environment but management wasn't clear on what tasks to do and they wanted you to do things their way even if your way more efficient.
good,"customer service, inventory check and review, stocking. and ordering."
good,"A typical day involved reviewing sales, viewing web sites and looking for new items to list on the web. Reviewing our own site and look for things that are out of place."
good,A typical day would be for me to open up the fitting room. Thin I would go check for any returns from the over night and check the fitting rooms to make sure they are ready to be used. I would also check to see if I have any assignments on the computer at the counter. The hardest part of the job would be when you have multiple calls on the phone to be directed as well as customers needing to try on clothes. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that I have helped someone and that I have done my job.
good,walmart is a very busy place to work if you don't know how to manage time you will get nothing done. You have to learn various departments in order to do a job. the hardest part is not have enough departments to help but if I can help I will learn as fast as I can
good,"Shipping and Receiving, working the floor as a Supervisor 2."
good,es bueno el trabajo positivo pero no hay posibilidades de crecimiento!!
good,"working nights for many years, was a very good growth experiance."
good,"Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, com vários benefícios."

good,"busy, less then 32 hours sum times. you lean to face all types of customesgeart place to learn basic skill"
good,Was in charge of inventory control on the grocery side. Also assist guests with finding what they are looking for.
good,"It would start out by having a meeting talking about what needs to be done for the night. Taught me how to be a team player, best management I ever had, co-workers were to work with, hardest part was leaving (due to a higher paying job). And the most enjoyable part of the job was that they gave me a chance."
good,"Regular days tend to be a little slow. I've learned that you must be extremely patient with certain customers. The management at Walmart can be a little rough sometimes, but someone is always there to answer any questions or concerns you may have. The hardest part of my job would be getting customers to realize that we are just retail sellers of the cellular carriers we provide and not the actual corporate stores. Last but not least, I enjoy helping the customers the most. Some are elderly and don't quite understand how the electronics work that they purchase. We are always glad to be of some assistance to all of our customers."
good,Se me caya una tasa asi mismo la tuve que pagar
good,"I was working for Walmart for almost 2 years, the managers care about you and your family."

good,Unloading and stocking point of sale products and performing inventory and customer service when needed.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. They treat their employees with a lot of respect.
good,"My typical day at work would, to start i would stock items that have been returned or out of place. Look at that days goals to be completed. help any customers find things. Sometimes look after automotive and hardware while looking after my own section. Keep workplace neat and clean."
good,I worked as a cashier and on a busy day it was very fun. I enjoyed seeing people and making them laugh. I tried to make it as fun as I could to be standing in the same spot all day.
good,"Overworked, understaffed while cutting every corner in service and regulations."
good,Working at Walmart you have to be able to multi-task and be able to work fast when the store gets busy.
good,Great place to work if you want to work in retail. People are friendly and nice. You can advance up in the company if you want to.
good,"Nice place to work part time, coworkers are nice, management could use better leadership skills."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was a very exciting time for me. I learned a lot, I met a lot of wonderful people who are now close friends of mine. It was always very busy at night. Thanksgiving & Christmas were the best working times for me. You see a lot of crazy situations and encounter with a variety of personalities when it comes to customers. Some bad but mostly good! Love my co-workers and I miss them dearly. We all got along very well. I miss organizing our monthly potlucks and celebrating co-workers birthdays. One thing that I disliked about working was coming in on my shift to see that the shift before me never completed their task and our shift held responsible to get it done along with out nightly task. Sometimes it was too much to bare but we managed."
good,"a typical day for me was scheduling, paperwork, keeping inventory supervising my employees. I learned how to supervise people, communicate with customers, manage my area. management was ok we were bumping heads. the hardest part of my job was working with the assistant management. I enjoyed working with the customer."
good,"The other workers were wonderful and very helpful. Some of the management wasn't very good at leading, but only because they hadn't been trained in leadership."

good,"Good place to work, but due to a life change need full time work."
good,As soon as I walk in im surronded by friendly faces. coworkers and regular customers are what I look forward to each day. The open door policy so far has been a big part in my achievements in the work place. Difficult customers are character builders to me.
good,"Walmart gets a bad rap, but in my 5 & 1/2 years with the company I have to admit that I enjoyed it there. I did work in the pharmacy though and this could explain for my bias. I worked with great people and the enviroment was fast paced and professional."
good,"es una empresa responsable con valores y los ase valer ya que como prevención que era no debe aver ningun error ya que es una cosa seria porque tienes a cargo un acceso o los monitores de la tienda, en un dia normal es llegar y preguntar que novedades hay y que pendientes para a si seguir con las indicaciones, las cosas que aprendí es a manejar monitores, hablar con un cliente que se esta llevando alguna cosa actuar en una situación de esas, lo que se me dificulto fue sacar los inventarios por escaneo, lo que mas me gusto fue la convivencia que hay entre el personal ya que puedes contar con ellos"
good,Aprendi bastante sobre gestão de pessoas e principalmente a como gerir um grupo extremamente diversificado de maneira eficiente e empolgante.
good,"In management, you can afford the benefits easier but even as an hourly they are still good. Have health, life, dental, 401k, stock purchase, etc. Very rough to be in a mgmt position and have a family (esp if a single parent). Loved my job there and the people but I was a single mom and it was just too much being away from my son. I especially love working with people and helping them to grow and learn. The most rewarding was watching them get promoted and that little old lady that would stop you in housewares and tell you her life story :)"
good,"A typical day on the job consisted of: changing oil, fluid checks, replacing tire, flat repairs, tire rotations, balancing, cleaning the shop, stocking, and customer service.

good,At this place its very easy to be overlooked as an associate and there isn't much room to move up into management.
good,"A typical day on third shift consisted of stocking freight in multiple areas. There was always something to be done. Some days were more intense than the others and there were only two or three times that I can recall not being able to complete the work that was assigned out of the 90+ days that I worked there. For the most part management was pretty good. There was only one manager that I had a problem with but that was because they always had a bad attitude and never knew how to talk to the employees in a proper manner. My co-workers had the tendency to spread rumors and cause problems so I stayed to myself the majority of the time. There were however a few co-workers that I was able to grow a bond with and I enjoyed that. The hardest part of the job was being by yourself for a good 8 hours just stocking freight. If you are not in tune with yourself, it would be difficult to get things done. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to make friends with some of my co-workers. I still go back and visit them from time to time."
good,A typical day at work was unloading the truck and stocking and managing inventory. Management left us alone unless there was something outside of our usual jobs that needed done. My co-workers were fun people and made the time more enjoyable.
good,Overnight stock/ Sales Associate. This was my first time working overnight. I did learn how to deal with a lot of different personalities. The hardest part of the job was working overnight.

good,"This job has been a very solid job for me over the past 19 years. I have learned many new things, including the Accounting experience which I hope to take with me to a new career."
good,"The job has set hours, but random days. I go in to work at 4 P.M. and head to the backroom to unload the general merchandise truck. All the freight is organized onto pallets to be wheeled out later. The truck can take anywhere from an hour and a half to three hours to unload. Usually, management begins to wonder after about two and a half hours."
good,"Stocking shelves in random aisles around grocery. Chatting with co-workers during work sped the day along. Nice long lunch, and decent breaks."
good,Good company to work for.
good,"I have worked at the Neighborhood Market for seven months now, and I can confidently say that, while not the most interesting job in the world, it is not a bad one either."

good,"I go in have a morning meeting with upper management, get notes, pass them on to my department managers. I handled any customer service issue that came up during the day. I would help out in the departments where I was needed. I check with my department managers on where we stood with the notes at the end of the day report back to management. I learned a lot about dealing with stress and customers in a management role. I had a great group of associates that I supervised.The hardest part of my job was making a choice on how to deal with a situation and then management come behind me and over ride it.

Management were great and always influence me too work harder and stay positive. Co workers were generous and always willing to help. The hardest part of my job would be leaving because I like to work. The most enjoyable part of my job would always remain the customers and meeting new people."
good,It depended on the day. It could be crazy busy or dead.
good,A typical day at work was long but went by somewhat quickly when we were busy. The management was okay. They were always extremely busy so it took awhile for them to get back to you. Co-workers were friendly. Talking together and laughing was an everyday thing. The hardest part was dealing with the angry customers. The most enjoyable part was just having someone to talk to during the work day. Being able to laugh and meeting new people every 10 minutes or so.
good,"changing management can some times hurt the work relationship between the staff- because they are not trained, and take everything personal- you have to learn its a job and not a personal attack-try to work every one equal-its not walmart, the employees do not have a clear understand of their job duties-i wish i could be the voice of reason in the work place, to help fix emplee magament relatioinship- i'am 50 i get it!"

good,"My typical day was always productive cashing out customers or anything else my Managers needed me to do. I learned that some customers can not always be easy to deal with but when you keep calm and try to resolve it for them and smile a lot and be nice it can usually be resolved easily! I really loved my co-workers and they were always very helpful and nice, we all helped each other and got along wonderfully! The hardest part of this job would have to be some of the customers that were not so nice but as long as you do your job right, smile, and resolve the problem quickly, you usually didn't have any problems! The best part of the job was helping others and being like a family with Managers and my co-workers!"

good,"Whenever I leave from class, I immediate go straight to work. I would identify the tasks at hand before I jump straight to my duties. I have performed many duties such as stocking, dishwasher, and server. After the shift ends, I would make sure that everything within my station is as clean and neat as it should be."
good,"Normal days would include helping customers, checking them out, things of that nature. I'm learning that sometimes with this company, it takes a lot to further yourself. Management is okay. My co-workers are fun. The hardest part of the job is trying to remember what's needed for the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers as best as I can."

good,looking and observing for shoplifters and any safety valuations inside the store.
good,"jornada de 6 horas diarias, 6 días de trabajo y un franco semanal, llegaba siempre antes de la hora de ingreso porque me gustaba interactuar con mis compañeros de distintas áreas, aprendí el respeto por el individuo, la búsqueda de la excelencia, y tratar de siempre superar las expectativas de los clientes; la dirección se mostraba conforme y existía, el dialogo fluido, mis colegas dejaron huellas hermosas en mi corazón, justamente cuando quede sin trabajo después de 6 años, lo mas difícil fue despedirme de mis compañeros, y lo que mas me gustaba es que la diversión en el trabajo era casi un requisito."
good,"Needs to work on better implementation of company priorities and support for their managers, employees, and customers."
good,I am trained in many different departments in Wal-Mart. I am able to help customers all over the store. Each department I work in offers lots of work to keep me busy through the day. I like working closely with the customers and helping them find items they are looking for.
good,"scan department , count request, merchandise product"
good,"A typical day for me was to issue out prescription medications, and handle register transactions."
good,Walmart was when I was younger. It was great because I didn't have any children or major responsibilities. They gave me a lot of hours and the pay was bearable. The managers weren't always so great though. They felt they could talk to you any way they wanted and when I felt I was being discriminate against they didn't do much about it. I had a supervisor who was really cruel and even threatened me and I was the one in trouble. I loved meeting new people and the hours were great :)
good,"-Fast-paced, always keeping busy, friendly atmosphere."
good,It was a steady job. They gave me an opportunity to work up. There were both good and bad managers. Not all of them got back with you on questions you needed answered.
good,Didnt really do much but you had fun while at work. Every one played around and joked around while working
good,I like working with all the other associates. I feel the management requires to much out of all associates beneath them. I don't feel they give us ample time to complete the tasks that are assigned to each of us.
good,Just had to deal with alot of insurance companies and working with alot of customers. Some of those customers would be easy and some would be hard to deal with due to sickness or children being sick. Everyday was different.
good,I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. I am 63 years old and in the baking season ( Nov to Jan ) more goods are shipped and with as much as 2000 lbs of sugar to put up each night my hands were taking a beating. I had an pperation on my foot in April 2012 and pulling heavy loads were hurting my foot.
good,"I would cashier, write service orders for customers, stock shelves, pull freight. Had some really good co-workers and management was fair."
good,come in clock in and get to work. go to your department and put up stock. keep my area clean. go and help others if needed. work the register when it got busy. my co-worker were a lot of fun to work with. hardest times were doing christmas. the people
good,A typical work day was about an eleven hour day. It was something new to learn just about on a daily basis. I learned how to keep up with the orders and to make sure that the order was sent to the correct department so they could get to the correct customer. My co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the cold temperatures. I enjoyed learning about the different departments.
good,"a typical day was just regular sometimes long and productive always ...although sometimes i think the jobs can be a little complicated , overall fun experience!"
good,"I worked overnight stocking shelves, displays, inventory control."
good,Pull pallets from backroom and stock the store shelves. The hardest part would have to be staying up thru the long boring night hours. The management is fair. . .
good,"Basically customer service everyday, I've learned to widen my patience as a customer service associate the fact that I am dealing with different kinds of people with different races. Management is so far so good and they give employees an open door for them to express their apprehensions and concerns. About my co workers they seem nice and respectful and the hardest part of my job is when I am attending to 1-2-3-4 persons/customers at the same time since sometimes I work all by myself in the department and yet felt proud to have given them the service they deserve."
good,"Typical day consisted of processing wire tranfers, sorting returns, performing exchanges/returns/purchases. I learned how to further help customers in receiving the best service possible and how not to take things so personal. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. We made the job fun and worry free.The hardest part of the job was not having a consistent and united management team. I enjoyed interacting with and even getting to know some of the more regular customers."
good,I worked in the pharmacy filling prescriptions and inputing patients information into the system on a daily basis. Some days I worked 12 to 13 hours but always stayed busy because we were a high volume pharmacy. I was very close with my co-workers and we worked well together. What we had great management most of the time and they were fair with the schedule. The best part about my job were the customers. The worst part was always being understaffed.
good,it a constuction job lots of work but good pay it a cool place to work just because you get to do your own thing at your just show up and work hard
good,its a good place to work but it depends on the store your working in due to management
good,its a real cool place to wok if u like to stand for along time. the staff was ok when I was there. I really like it in the began but as your past it got to be a very big headache
good,Cutting Meat and handling customer is what I did working for Wal- Mart. I only work there for 5 months because I was moving to Kentucky. I would take break on time that if we have time but we was busy I alot. I cooked a lot.

good,"Good place for young, not sure it is good grown up job. Unless you can move up to management that is."
good,The job on a scale of 1-10 would be a 4. Pay is not equvilant to job duty's. No overtime allowed and benifits could be better for the time and energy put into the job that you are drastically under paid for. Managment is not what it should be by far. Very unappreciated for the diligent efforts made.
good,I enjoyed my experience at Wal-mart. Some of the managers I had saw my potential and allowed me to train in other positions.
good,This job was ok. I liked it cause I met great people and was able to help people.
good,Can be an ok place to work. Could be better! Needs better management in some stores.
good,As long as you get with the right store and management then you will have a pretty good place to work. But the only thing I don't like about walmart is that the managers are trained to lie to their employees. The managers promise you something but never come through what they promise that is what I don't like about walmart managers.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. You have to be a team player, and very flexible. I enjoyed my job there, but they laid me off right after Christmas."
good,I've learned excellent communication and cash handling skills from working in Walmart for 3 years.
good,- A typical day at work was always a new one.
good,It was good company to work for they had great benefuits that you could look for to.
good,"My typical day at work involves helping customers with purchasing and finding what merchandise they are seek. I have learned to work with all types of personalities and to understand how those personalities effect people's work ethics. I enjoy training new staff and helping other associates with questions. The hardest part of working at Walmart is the hours, not the four or five hours a day it is being away from my kids while they are home in the evenings and missing the family dinner. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers and getting to know them and there families."
good,"Walmart is a hard working enviroment. Ive learned to stock, help customers, and stay busy. Management was helpful at times. Co- workers and I got along to get the job done how we was told to do. The hardest part was working in the heat. The part I liked the most was the good compliments."
good,"A great company to start with. Only real issue is that some. Not all but some of the managers are twisted. They are masters of double talk, and make most White House politicians look honest."
good,management not to hot but good benefit. get to meet new people everyday dicent pay
good,"Busy, fast paced work place with good people to work for and with. The hardest part of the job is the job policies and procedures in which are extremely detailed, and this is because of the size of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,they seem to treat the workers pretty good. very physical work
good,"I love the challenge of learning something new and Walmart gives that opportunity to those who are willing.I may be sheduled as a Cashier but because I've manged to train myself in different areas,I'll also have to help out at Customer Service and relieve the Money Center Cashier for his/her break.The most enjoyable part is being of great value to the company,and the most difficult part is getting management to promote you to the next level.Walmart has taught me that with the perserverance and strong drive you can gain persnal development."
good,i felt as if the dock workers were underpaid because we unloaded trucks VERY quickly in a competitive environment and only got paid 9.00 per hr
good,"Manage the performance of direct reports and recruit, hire, and retain Associates"
good,"get there and start putting merchantdise out keep i out on inventory , management assign you tasks,co-wokers are very good people to work with.the hardest part of the job is probably some heavy lifting but part of the job"
good,"A typical day at work would be working woith different people and getting to learning how to establish a relationship with different people and providing communication & social skills with excelolent customer service. Management and co- workers were all fun to work with and always been assisted with help with needed from co-worker and management, the hardest part of the would be trying to find an item for a customer and we dont have it in stock.The most enjoyable part would be seeing a customer leave with a smile on their face and see them return to the store again, providing excellent customer service was also another enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day of my job at walmart consist of managing the front end including cashiers and service desk associates. I am also a cashier. I help a lot with customer service throughout the day. I have learned not to let anything get to me and if something upsets me either go to management and let them know what is going on or let it go. Management is very helpful at this company. I love everyone that I work with. They are very nice and help you out a lot with any problem to the best of their ability. The hardest part of my job would probably be all the notes that we get in the beginning of the day that need to be done during the day before we leave. Also, balancing all of the projects and getting the customers taking care of. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the people that I work with and all of the help that I can get when I need them."
good,It was a good work environment you could move from one position to another if you did a great job.
good,"Responsabilidade exigida , tornando a responsabilidade presente no dia a dia. Gostei de ter trabalhado na rede Wal-Mart para adquirir experiencia."
good,Answer phones take care of customers I do contracts and credit applications
good,it was my second job in my entire life and i was there 3 yrs. it was a rough 3 yrs but atleast they give u opportunities to learn and move up in the company. they motivate u and give you the time and tools to learn. you may have to learn on ur own sometimes but atleast you get the chance to do so.
good,"On a typical day at work, I put out freight to the floor and direct other scheduled associates to their tasks. Once the floor is filled, the momemtum shifts to the cooler in the backroom where we put the rest of the freight away in a neat and orderly fashion. I work on price changes, look at reports, change modulars, direct associates to other tasks that need to be done. Review notes given by management and prioritize them, delegate and make sure those tasks are accomplished. I have learned to be a leader, fair but firm. Have high expectations of myself and lead by example. I learned to do things orderly and neat, while managing the time given for best production. For the most part, management has been there supporting me when needed, but sometimes the communication is lacking. I have a great group of co-workers and they help me get the job done. The hardest part of the job is correcting an associate when things aren't done to expectations. The most enjoyable part is the ability to plan and make the department look inviting for the customer."
good,"I was customer service/ shipping recieving,stock,retail, i got the chance to do a lot of things at this job, i worked closely with shift supervisor."
good,"Managers usually have certain duties already planned for you, but most of the time, all the associates already know what their tasks are for the day. Its a really calming enviroment, not including our black friday sales or food stamp day of the months. Its basically goes to serving the customers and making sure they leave pleased and wanting to come back."
good,Stockining old as well as new products
good,"I found the experience level needed to do this job to be very attainable. Some of management was caring, the other part wanted to show their power and were difficult to work with."
good,"My work day consists of checking for tasks expected to be completed on that particular work day. I like to check to see what is featured on the sales floor. Speak with co-workers and management to see how the day is progressing so far. Start working on the tasks that need to be taken care of in a productive and timely manner. I have learn a totally different side of business in retail, the back room and how the circle needs to be completed. I make it a point to know how to perform my job in a manner that compliments my co-workers, management and myself. The way you perform your job and how you conduct yourself, not only reflects on you, but also your co-workers and the company that you are representing or working for. The hardest part of my job is the heavy lifting, but I do enjoy the challenge. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure I am helping all involved to provide the best quality of work. To maintain the highest customer service to our customers. I love to smile. Doing my job correctly is very important to me."
good,Like any job you have your drama but it's a nice place to work. There are friendly people to work with and there are a lot of friendly customers that come in on the daily. The management team is cool. If you come to work on time and do what your supposed to do u won't have any problems
good,"Learn new things everyday, stocking shelves, cashiering, solving customers' problems, and interacting with customers"
good,Uma Empresa com culturas e valores responsabilidade social. Agradeço muito! Pois tive muitas oportunidade de aprende e ser o profissional que sou hoje.
good,"employees always are in need of some form of guidence, and it was a pleasure to assist them."
good,"A lot of Wal-Mart stores are now open 24/7, which means, you will need more staff to accomodate the store's needs. However, having a store open for 24 hours means, constant staff working, which can be a little overwhelming for even customers to witness. Thus to be said, having items constantly stocked is promoting great customer service. Having a great company doesn't just simply detail profits but also includes; feedback from staff and management. Depending on how management treats you will determine how staff may view their feedback on working for Wal-Mart. It can be tiring to work long hours however if you enjoy working in a specific department, the hours may go fast. It all depends on each staff member's viewpoint. With that said, I enjoyed working with staff and management and I had a good time interacting with customers as well."

good,"Walmart, has a great working environment it is for people who are customer oriented and customer service based"
good,"Modular Maintenance is easy job..anyone with logic can do this. Consisted of shifting item locations around, deleting items, moving shelfs, and stocking empty locations. Management was fairly good except sometimes we got pulled to stock, which was good too, we were a variety of roles. Hardest part of the job is that it's night shift."
good,The place was filled with busy work but overall it was an experience
good,my daily duties were running the cash register and stocking
good,i learned how to recognize associates strengths and weeknesses. competent however not always as effective as possible. i worked with a solid team that was very sucessful at producing good results.

good,"It was okay just not the job I needed at this time in my life, the pay is desent and hours not bad if you dont have a kid but I am trying to go to school and provide for my son I dont have anything bad to say I would go back if the job was for me."
good,"As a Walmart Associate, the work I do is a fun job. It's a fast paced enviornment. I love what I do. I do my duty in my department."
good,"Me gustaba trabajar en el turno matutino debido a que llegas con todas las pilas puestas, esta empresa tiene muchos valores lamentablemente a veces los gerentes de tienda lo tiran a la basura, en ocasiones se trabaja bajo presion y eso era bueno, aprendi muchas cosas como a hacer puntual, responsable, y tome mucha experiencia."
good,good benefits friendly people good pay plenty of things to learn and lots of experience
good,"Trained new employees in the proper and efficient way to accomplish the duties of the position. Sweep and mopped sales floor to maintain a clean and safe shopping work environment. Scrubbed, waxed and buffed the sales floors using industrial equipment. Emptied trash and maintained the employee break room. Greeted and interacted with customers. Stocking store merchandise efficiently."
good,I just didn't find myself able to branch out and do what I wanted to do.
good,"Stocking and cashiering at the electronics section.as well as giving good costummer sevice,and greeting. i have learned some differences on T.v's. some managers can be a little unprofessional at times or treat new employees unfairly compared to the full time employees with any explainations. hardest part of the job was working with unprofessional employees. but enjoyed working for great costumers."
good,"When I get to work, I usually see at least three managers walking the floor before I get to the time clock. My co-workers are friendly and enjoyable to work with as well as the managers. I have learned how to work in the public with satisfactory service. The hardest part is dealing with upset customers because I want them to have a good time shopping with us. The most enjoyable part is when the customer leaves happy."
good,"a typical day for me at work is not knowing if i will have anything to do that day or not, or even if i will have a job anymore because wal mart is going through so many changes lately"
good,With always something to do days went fast. I learned Inventory systems and people skills. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was definately around the holidays. I really enjoyed when my customers left completely satisfied with their experience with me.
good,This is a very stable and secure company to work for. The work life balance is very decent. While there is ample opportunity to move up it is still very hard in metro areas because of the saturation of people trying for the same jobs.
good,"Muchas cosas no me gustaron, por lo que decidi salirme, pero entre otras que me gustaron mucho fue el reconocimiento de mis clientes, lograr alcances de 1,000,000 de pesos arriba del presupuesto mantener unido a mi equipo de area, saber que podia contar con ellos y ellos conmigo, estar propuesto para jefatura de prevencion y tambien en otro momento para una subgerencia por lo menos de palabra de uno de mis gerentes, lastima que se fue antes de concretar, siempre lograr evaluaciones de 3.5 Que era calificacion perfecta para las politicas, que aun cuando mucha gente consideraba que era un mal empleo a mi me enorgullecia, algo dificil de hacer era dar resultados con poco o casi nada de recursos, entre ellos los humanos, nunca entendi como era posible que dieramos el 54% de ganacias para la empresa y tubieramos los peores sueldos"
good,"had a great time working at Wal-Mart but I think it was mostly due to the people I worked with. The people in my department made it a really fun place to work but If they weren't there, it wouldn't have been as worth while. The management definitely has some problems because one manager would tell us one thing and another would tell us a completely other thing. But benefits and pay were OK. Altogether an OK place to work if you are looking for a part-time job - not a career."
good,I moved up fast with this company and learned alot.I started as a cashier the moved up to customer service than department mgr. within one year
good,The managers didn't always follow the rules and used them to their advantages. They picked favorites and let the other employees get away with things they shouldn't have.
good,"Just a slow work day almost everyday. I learned how to use a different program of a cash register system. The hardest part of the day was working in the heat. The most enjoyable was lunch. Co-workers were nice and very helpful, and management was always busy."
good,Being an accounting office employee I was behind the scenes and i would have worked in that position for very long time if it wasn't for the low pay
good,"Everyday was busy with checking in orders and filling prescriptions. I learned a lot of people skills and how to multi task. Management was great and easy to work with. My co workers where very helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, but i soon learned how to adapt. I really enjoyed filling medicine, answering the phone, and working with the customers."
good,I enjoyed my job they have wall of heroes for the employees that are vets.they also have safety awards. I was a 2 time safety associate of the month
good,"At Wal-Mart I provide great customer service, which is the mean goal of the company. My main focus is on the inventory to control stock level. I have learned how to interact and deal with different people. The managment and my Co-workers are the best idea generators. Although we have different backgrounds we still work as a team, in respect and colaboration. There isn't a hard part to my job, I do my job efficiently as it is and i feel good about it. Generally I enjoy everything about my job."
good,"While working at Wal-Mart, I learned a lot bout how the company works. I learned about the work put into making the company a success."
good,"My managers liked me because i am a very hard worker, i go above and beyond to get the job done. They helped me in so many ways, i learned so much working there."
good,Typical day is like an early rise of the sun. You are bright and awake once the customer arive
good,"Une journée là où l'entreprise reçoit beaucoup de clients , le patron demande du support des autres départements de la compagnie, par exemple; le remplacement des caissières par des commis ,ainsi ces dernières pourront prendre leur break."
good,"I would clock in, go to my assigned area, and proceed to see if anything needed to be done or anything I could be of assistance to. I mostly stocked shelves, cashiered, helped customers find there merchandise, and help keep our facility clean"
good,I enjoyed working here but there were up's and down's as far as communication and leadership.
good,"There's a lot of consistency and chance to learn how to think positive. Ethics are good but leadership is confined to following procedures. The hardest part of the job is having little control and co-workers not showing for scheduled shifts. The best part is getting to leave at your scheduled time, safe and without major stress."
good,"A wonderful learning ground to build experience, respect for the individual,striving for excellence,service to the customers,associates/employees, & the importance of servant leadership. Wal-Mart helps build a strong foundation for any endeavor or career you choose inside or outside the company. It is a fast paced environment, constant change & new programs & operations to coincide with trends & customer demands."
good,"this was a great place to work, made a lot of friends here. The only thing I had an issue with is their measures used for promotion."
good,Fast pace company with the opportunity to advance to higher pay.
good,I enjoyed working in Walmart. It was fun seeing different people of the world and dealing with all the customers needs.
good,Didn't mind working there but working third shift took a huge toll on my life so I had to get out while I could.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart. I loved my coworkers and the management were very fair with me. It was not an easy job. It was extremely physical and tiring. They were very fair with break times. They were just cost cutting too much and cutting jobs and hours, but expected remaining staff to work faster and harder to compensate for being short staffed."
good,"ordering and stocking freight, management was always around you and looking over shoulder, coworkers were ok, nothing hard, the most enjoyable part was unloading trucks"
good,"Although they did pay well, it was not a job that I would suggest for someone that puts church above all things. When I told the hiring person that I have church on Sunday mornings, it was as if it went into one ear and never had a chance to get out of the other. They scheduled me to work on Easter Sunday morning (which was and is important) and I was not happy. It also interfered with my substitute teaching post as well."
good,Typical day of work includes taking care of customers and making sure your register is clean. I have learned how to handle tough situations and have learned how to do other things in the store.
good,typical day was catching up or running behind
good,all in all walmart is a good place to work if you just want a temporary job while your in school or just needing some kind of income or a part time job while working some where else if you like a wide varity of things to do and doing the same thing three times over because manegment cant figure out what to do than walmart might be for you
good,The ethics of Walmart are on point. The envirment is flexible.
good,my most joyable part of my day is working with the people....
good,The job was ok but too much was required of you because you had to work every job in the store for a little pay
good,"A typical night at work was to get there around 10pm and have a cup of coffee with the old timers and talk about life until the time to work arrived. I was in charge of the water and soda aisles everynight and also responcible for making carboard bails and participate in aiding other departments through-out the store including pulling freight from the various trucks, pushing carts, and keeping my area in the back stockroom area organized and clean. Management is the way most people like it, not micro managed. The coworkers were ones you will never forget, especially working overnight shifts. Everyone gets close because around 3am everyone is too tired to be something other than themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work and the people. The hardest was the 10p-7a full time schedule."
good,"My typical day started at 2pm and I would walk into the afternoon traffic at work. Carts would be low, cashiers breaks would not be done, and our cash drawer would not be balanced. I felt like I had to pick up the pieces almost every day. I learned that pleasing different managers that want different things was very hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I had a day with acceptable coverage and things would run semi-smoothly."
good,i would restock items and help customers. i learned how to handle talking to people who were upset.
good,I enjoyed the job. It was fast-paced and very educational to me. I was fresh off the street when I received my certification so I learned a lot about the drugs and what sir uses were. I also learned how to fill prescriptions and working the computer system.
good,"In general on a typical workday I would be supervising 50+ cashiers in all depts of the store. I was in charge of handing out change to all cashiers as needed, giving money center loans for cashing payroll checks, checking out customers when we were extremely busy, push carts in parking lot when shorthanded on cart pushers, clean registers, conduct 20+ registers daily to reduce theft, assist at the customer service desk with refunds when backed up."
good,Working in stocking a typical day was placing merchandise on the shelves and helping customers find the items they were looking for. As a cashier at Walmart my typical day was checking out the customers items and to make sure their last impression of the store was good. The over all staff at Walmart was very kind and understanding. The hardest part of the day was trying to please each and every customer.
good,Ela é boa de trabalhar pôs me deu uma grande oportunidade de trabalho.
good,"the job was easy if you knew what you was doing. never had enough people working, management was horrible."
good,"Good hours, decent pay, poor communication, very strict, works around some schedules"
good,Walmart was a fairly decent place to work but also has a lower pay scale than other places. If you are only seeking a job Walmart will suffice.
good,"it was a fun yet mildly stressfull working location with constent changing of rules and thoughts, not very outgoing but can pt on a great front."
good,"any day at wal-mart can be different from the next.some days i run register,some times i do dept.82(candy in register aisle),other times its the service desk.i enjoy doing different things but ill never get full time there."
good,A productive work day would be; when everyone is happy and work is getting done.
good,"Walmart is a very structured company. We had our job duties that needed to be performed in a timely manner and projects such as moving sections around, updating the weekly new released movies and video games. Also maintain exceptional customer service, push the newest products, be knowledgeable about all the current electronics. Maintain the section by organizing, restocking and keeping the area clean."
good,I worked for walmart for 4 years. i worked in vrious departments within walmart. hardest part of the job was the overnight shift. the best part of the job was my coworkers and how we balanced worklife and homelife together.
good,"I would go in and check customers out of store with their purchases, zone floor and shelves for stray merchandise. Help set out new merchandise in a good layout. Most of my co-workers were very easy to get along with and the Management team we exceptional most of the time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers that would get mad over something that you couldn't control and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that were fun and joking with you while you were waiting on them."
good,"Wal-mart is a place to learn numerous set of skills, from customer service, cash handling, as well as managerial duties. During my years at Wal-mart, I have learned how to resolve problems in stressful situations. Wal-mart has learned me skills in management in pursuing my future goals as top management."
good,"Values- this company still follows many of the values that its founder Sam Walton founded the company on. Sam Walton believed that Wal-Mart most valuable asset was not the money in the cash register, not the merchandise on the shelves, but the associates who work in their stores and at least in my store treated them as such.In general I found executives to be very knowledgeable and approachable. Lots of people have worked their way up from the stores, because they're always giving opportunities to advance, or to cross-train. I learned to work alone and in teams, to set goals and execute them, and how to communicate effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others and giving back to the community."
good,The days were started off with looking at sales ensuring the store was ready to open. typically you would have a morning meeting to inform your associates and recognize associates for accomplishments. Managers did minmal training of their subordinates but they would do daily walks of areas in your depatments for instruction and to ensure compliance of the home office/district layouts. Most workers were hard working and dedicated to succeed my first Wal-Mart job had associates that had averaged 10 years or more with the company. The hardest part of the job was the long hours as a manager some weeks you worked 6-7 days. The most enjoyable part was changing the store during the seasionality events and having fashion shows to show the new fashion for the seasons and the envolvement and excitement that was displayed by the asociates.
good,Good place to work if you love working with people I enjoyed it.
good,I enjoyed working there co-workers are friendly and helpful. I enjoyed no safety viloation bbq and christimas time potlucks.
good,"protecting the assets of the company including the associates through prevention, awareness, communication, and deterrance"
good,"Very high volume and pace pharmacy. I have learned and improved many skills while working here. The hardest part of my job is not having the ability to work manageable hours and attend college to pursue a career as a pharmacist as well. The most enjoyable part is the patients and customers, you develop friendships with the many people you come into contact with."
good,I love working at Walmart .sometime there was a lot o hour and sometime there was a lot of hours..I hate zoning time I love been a cashier because your time goes by fast
good,"Overall I have enjoyed the experience. It's like most other work places, there is good and bad but that's part of lie itself."
good,My responsibilities at Walmart consisted of maintaining a clean and enjoyable shopping environment for all store guests while at the same time ensuring a timely and safe unload of all stock from delivery truck. Working at Walmart allowed me to be an integral member of a team within a friendly environment. I learned the value of team work and saw how my every day efforts benefited customers. The most challenging part of working at Walmart was being on my feet all day however the most enjoyable was seeing that everything I did in a day made the shopping experience that much better for each customer.
good,Working at Wal-Mart is easy. It's not a hard job anfd you are still able to be off when you need to be b/c there are so many employees in every store they can accommodate vacation requests.
good,"Its a high volume work place, with lots of customers. Perfect customer service is a must."
good,"A typical day involves stocking, keeping department well maintained, and customer service. I enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,"Each customer is different so you have to be able to read customers to know how to treat them (playful, serious, business), Many of the co-workers are great but as with any employment environment there will be some that complain and do not understand customer service,"
good,"I loved my job. The work was easy. Yet, like any other work place it had its days. A typical day would be me and at times another co-worker (I was full-time, they were part-time) would open the office. We would do our daily routines from start to finish. We had certain deadlines we had to meet on a daily basis. We had daily paper work for management to sign. Once that was done we could file that paperwork. My management team was good. There were great managers, then there were managers who I personally felt they could care less about their staff. There were also the managers that would say or do one thing and turn around and do or say another. Since I have lost my job working with Wal-Mart, I have learned to trust nobody. I knew that before Wal-Mart. However, due to certain managers that work at Wal-Mart, I do not feel I will ever be in the position I am in now - jobless. There was not really a hard part of work. The hardest thing for me was certain circumstances arose and at times it became hard for me to get to work at 5a.m. on top of a 45 minute car drive one way. These circumstances have since been taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers and customers. I had an amazing co-worker who shared the office with me. I just hope there is someone else out there as amazing as she was that I can get to know and work aside. I am glad to say I remain friends with her and others."
good,"I looked forward to going to work and interacting with the other managers on a day to day basis. The labour shortages forced us to take on many rolls and engage associates in ways that made the store atmosphere fun to be in , even when there were days with very trying workloads.We all pulled together to get the job done and had some laughs along the way."
good,This is a good company to work for. I always felt secure in my job and management wanted me to continue up through the management program. I thought they should have paid their employees better though. Other than this it is a good place to work.
good,"I have worked for Walmart for 8 yrs. I have held many positions and performed many job functions. A day at Walmart changes at anytime. You need to be willing to change a task and work on what is needed for the customer and store. The people I work with have great ideas at times and are willing to help others with a given task. The managers for a store change often. The moves are due to company demands. The new managers come in with many new ideas. Some are great and some are not. They treat people with respect and let the team voice ideas for creating a better shopping experience for the customer. The hardest part of the job is several managers on one task and they all have different ideas as to how they want it completed . The most enjoyable thing I do, is work with great people and being able to provide great service to our customers."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is stock shelves,complete tasks assigned by management."
good,The work was ok. The employees were nice there. I liked having regular customers.
good,"loved this job, great coworkers, great managers, a job base that pushes you to exceed everyday. put on time limits to get a job accomplished made this job more enjoyable beacuse we worked together as a team and would get it done. very respectful and family based enviorment. i learned alot at walmart. there wasnt ever someone new that you couldnt learn."
good,A typical day was receiving inbound calls from consumers about their banking needs and providing customer service.
good,Lots of wonderful people working at Walmart. Walmart is very customer oriented. They believe the customer always comes first. The only difficult part is standing for such long hours.
good,I enjoy working at Wal-Mart but would like to pursue a career in either accounting or Payroll. Wal-Mart also does not seem to have much room for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working with WalMart. I advanced my position within the first year of employment. The overall environment of the store was was positive and I had a great working relationship with management.
good,My job is a easy going sociable place which invites me to stay connected with the public.It has great co workers who are willing to assist with any problems that may arise.
good,"I was a cashier and a sales associate, I learned how to handle money, work with customers, the management was good but not great. My co-workers were great anytime I needed help or had a question they would help me. the hardest part was that the management won't work with me when I had to go on early maturity leave. The most enjoyable thing was dealing with the customers"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. I was always busy. The management would take advantage of the workers as much as they can get away with it. I took on a lot of work. I was hired as an overnight stocker, but I was also doing the work of other employees.....unloading store trucks, down stacking merchandise, cashiering, taking merchandise to the floor, clearing the floor of merchandise by taking it back to the backroom, and covering for other employees by helping or doing their work."
good,Here is another place you get to meet a lot of different people. The pay really wasn't fitting for my experience.
good,"A typical day would consist of unloading trucks for the entire 5 to 6 hour period. Some stuff light, some stuff heavy. Always fast paced."
good,Wal Mart is a very busy place to work and i worked there during the holidays. Some co-workers were ok and got along well with others not so much.
good,A lot to do with very lil time to do it. Not enough help in dept to supplement the workload.
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart for me was enjoyable for me at the time.
good,good people management could be better they could have listen tothe people more
good,It is a fun place to work. Love working with my co-workers. Very easy to get along with. Outstanding management team. Always willing to jump right in. The hardest part of the day would be not enough product coming in. All in all not a bad place to work.
good,"You are always busy and Wal-Mart. You need to always greet the customers with a smile and say ""Welcome to Wal-Mart' and ""Did you find everything alright""? Good place to work."
good,A typical day at this job is walking in and going straight to our daily scheduled activities we do at which ever time we come on.
good,i enjoyed working there .a typical day at work would be working as a cashier.the hardest part of the job was when you had a unstaified customer.
good,"After clocking in, to walk into a meeting to learn what my job duties were for the day and address whatever issues they had the previous shift and from the previous night we worked. I however, learned alot about job responsibilities as well as some important values I can take away from the workplace there. Management was kind of poor, they couldve taken better care of there employees. Hardest part of the job was constantly being checked on by not one but atleast four managers in a night recieving four different assignments from each manager. The best part of working there was the overnight team I had to work with, great and very humble people and fun to work with."
good,"Would wait on people all day long checking them out. Would help people find items and would restock shelves. Management was not always that friendly, and it was hard to ever move up in the company."
good,My time working at Wal-Mart was a great experience to learn new things and work with new people. I learned many things while working there. A lot of things in that working environment changed but it was not hard to adapt to them. I am looking forward to another job experience to learn more about the working world.
good,Loved my customers. They seemed to come to my line no matter how long the line was.
good,Focus on the good of the employees and not their mistakes because
good,I loved when I worked here! I wish I could get back on! I would love to help rebuild what I once built up when it was first opened
good,I enjoyed working for wal-mart a lot of advancement opportunity if you are willing to show you can do the work. Pay is a bit low even for department managers and insurance wasnt really that good for how much it costs per check.
good,"i have learned alot about managing others, ordering, merchandising."
good,Fast paced and inventory driven. Great customer service training.
good,"In my store, some of the employees whom have been there longer seem to take more charge over the new employees or employees of younger age at a very strong rate. They are not respectful, they try to get each other in trouble in an immature manner, they are not team oriented, and make it an unpleasant environment."
good,Walmart is a fast pace workplace for a cashier or any worker. The company focuses on customer service and the customers come first. You can advance in this company if you are looking to pursue a career in retail. In this company you can move up within six months of employment there.
good,Nice people good team players. Not always good about scheduling your hours.
good,Really enjoyed the busy and fast pace as a cashier. It made the time fly by and you got to meet all kinds of different and interesting people.
good,I worked at 2 different store locations. I was a cashier at both stores and I liked it. It was an easy job that was willing to work around my school schedule.
good,They gave me several tasks to perform during my time with them.
good,Enjoyed helping many customers and meeting many other co-workers
good,"My time spent at Wal-mart was very rewarding. There is a good atmosphere, great people, and tons of opportunity. Wal-mart is always pushing the envelope and looking for ways to deliver a better shopping experience."
good,Wal-Mart was fun to work for in the beginning but the longer I worked there the more stressful it became. Some employees seemed a bit uptight so there stress was passed on to others.
good,Wal mart is one of the leading stores in america and the world but when it comes to communication they are not there yet. wal mart is a good spot to work if you can get over the fact that you have like 20 people telling you to do different things all at the same time
good,The company as a whole could be better if they could keep their managers.
good,"I pushed a lot of carts. Wal mart has a lot of opportunities, and is a great place of employment, I would refer someone to this job."
good,There are three shifts that is available for any person to apply for. The overnight positions does pay a compensation for nights and has it's good points and bad points.
good,This was a good work environment for me I learned good customer service skills and how to keep calm and work well with others in certen Secom stances. This job also helped me learn how to keep track of money and also how to manage my time and become more responsible for myself and my actions.
good,Wal-Mart has great opportunities for associate to further themselves toward reaching a career.
good,"Working for Walmart was a good experience. The fellow associates made the day go by faster. Always had something to do and you always stayed busy. Always had that crunch time before the store opens, it was exciting. Everyday you finished your shift, you go home knowing you earned every dollar. Customers always got great customer service too."
good,"Forget the stereotypes. Walmart is a great company to work for if you are someone that works hard and can think on their feet. When I lost my job, Walmart was there to help me transition from part time as my second job to full time. The pay is the only downfall. Unless you are salaried management or put in the years to earn raises, it doesn't add up."
good,Can be a great company if everyone was on the same page. Sometimes Management does not know what to do or which guidelines to follow!
good,"Because of the work load (550 to 700 prescriptions a day), most pharmacists find working at Wal-mart rather challenging. However, I am a very hard worker so I excelled at productivity, customer service and team building. All of the stores I worked at really enjoyed having me as a floater pharmacist. I had to leave my position because of an illness in the family, otherwise I would have stayed with the organization."
good,"Walmart is a stable company, and can provide job security for a good employee. However, the work-life balance with this company is not desirable, as you must be available for any shift, which is subject to change week to week, and weekends are required. Additionally, all holidays other than Christmas day are required, and black out dates for vacation apply. They do give their employees more breaks than most employers, and promotion into lower supervisory positions is pretty easy to obtain. Walmart is a company that will require you to work in any other given position at any time. This can be both good and bad, as the experience in another position can help you become a more well-rounded employee, but the constant removal from your own duties causes you to be unable to complete work on time. No consistency between policy and enforcement of said policy by management."
good,Wal-Mart is a very stable company to work for. Management can be very understanding and flexible with your personal life.
good,WALMART is a great place to work with excellent opurtunities to advance. The only con was was the pay I ended my job at Walmart due to only making $8.00 an hour for managing there pet department.
good,"I was there since they open, so I knew most of the people. They are always trying to make you feel like family. Sometimes we did have our struggles but we work them out and it was always nice to feel safe and loved even in your work. I gaing a great deal of experience there."
good,"Fast paced, the opportunity for advancement, ability to transfer to other locations if needed."
good,Overall this place of employment was very enjoyable. I got alone good with the management team and the other co-workers. The pay wasn't good.
good,I really liked the on going training modules they used to train us after our employment.
good,"Working at Walmart was fun, and fast past. My co-workers were nice and respectful."
good,Management will help you advance if you would like to.
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for.They are family oriented and work with employees.They take the time to do the training required for a specific job.
good,They worked well with my school schedule. They also were helpful when I needed something.
good,Walmart is a good place to work though in the past few years they have taken some of the benefits away from associates and it is a lot tougher to move up with the company. Very few employees are given the opportunity to start full time and so If you can accept part time work and the willingness to work hard and be productive you can advance with the company.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers as well as the staff. I learned that, some people come into the store to just be around friendly people for a conversation and to feel wanted. Management slightly fair. The job is only hard if you make it hard. Meeting people and making sure he/she gets the best service when needed."
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart was positive. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a job. The schedule was a little erratic. If your single with no kids it will be fine. If you have a family it will be alot harder to"
good,Working with they company is easy but most of the people dat works there don’t like people of color and they hardest part of the job is dat if u need help u don’t get it
good,"Walmart is overall a good place to work, but the management is kind of out of touch. They’re on hand when you need them for customers, but otherwise they are scarce. The people in the electronics department really help you get used to it because it’s a lot to take in and a lot to learn. They do pay the customer service based departments a good amount but they also use everyone around the store for different tasks just to please the store manager Who demands a lot of work done with no time to do it. Coverage is usually bad and they don’t really have many closer. But depending on the people you work with daily it really makes or breaks you’re working experience."
good,It’s a good job there’s always something to do they are really good at making sure it’s something u want they don’t want u to leave so they try to find the right department your happy with
good,I think that the hardest part of the job is dealing with managers that they have little clue on what they suppose to do. I like to help my coworkers when they have a question about what they suppose to do or how to do it faster and better.
good,A cultura do Walmart é fabulosa quando aplicada na prática por sua liderança.
good,"working with other associate and serving the customers are fun, but maintaining the speed can be stressful for some. I developed my communication management skills learnt how to serve a customer better."
good,Good place to work. Flexible hours and decent pay. Profit sharing and stock. Quarterly bonuses. Flexible absence policy. PTO hours and protected pto..
good,"I enjoy working here, I would recommenced other people to work here because it is fun and it pays well for a part time job. Coworkers are great to get along with, managers are understanding."
good,Get in work hard and network het in with a manager that likes how you work and dont let them dnow and when u see a  Position you want I know what you need to do to get it
good,"My work was maintenance to clean and wax floors, outside pick ups if needed, help others and customers if needed. Pick up in store help stock if needed."
good,Working at a chain like Walmart is a great experience for anybody looking to be in the customer service area of work! You interact with a variety of different people.
good,"I work at a Neighborhood Walmart, and I am sure it’s different than a Super Center. It’s small you get to know the store quickly and you get to know all the associates that work there."
good,Agradecida de la oportunidad y el crecimiento. Es un buen lugar para tomar experiencias
good,"This job is just right for you if you are looking for a good and stable job, also the managers are very under standing and the hours are very flexible especially if you have any extra curricular activitiesgoing on"
good,"Sales, cashiering, stocking and facing shelves, maintaining photo lab and orders, helping customers with items in locked cases and checking the back stock room for product availability."
good,"This is a great job to do for  those who are task oriented and require little oversight. You  will be mostly left to your own devices to unload pallets and stock shelves, and those with the ability to quickly do so will see great success."
good,"Working at Walmart is fun at times, you'll get to meet some fun people with great attitudes and test your limits as a worker. You can always apply for different positions and learn new things to expand your knowledge. People you work with are a mixture of attitudes, you'll have people who are bubbly and cheerful, and people who are just plain miserable. The management team is slowly making their way to being on the same page but its still chaotic. The hardest part of the job is being thrown to different positions throughout the store. You apply for one position but they will make you do every job there. It's a learn on your feet type job in most cases unless you find someone who's willing to train you correctly."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to start a career. They provide full benefits, full time, decent pay for a grocery store, willing to be flexible with hours and your life. downside is different work hours somedays. would have you there until 11, then to come back at 7 the next morning. I also have to work second shift which i am not a big fan of. I would prefer first but i cannot get moved to first, because of no openings."
good,Walmart has pros and cons like every company. They have good benefits and good management. I like the people I work with. We are like a family sometimes.
good,Working for the company is a great experience for myself and for most of all assistance for my children school in my room managers system was a little poor
good,It was definitely a learning experience for me and really enjoyed the people I worked for and with a lot of good times and meeting good new people daily
good,At my time at Walmart it challenged me to work beyond my work load and what I thought I could handle. I was surrounded by people who pushed me to be better daily.
good,I would like to see an increase in pay for hourly associates. The benefits at Walmart are really good and management is friendly a majority of the time.
good,Worked there for 22 years. Great benefits and stable work environment. Learned valuable lessons about working as a team. Helping our drivers be the best
good,Working at Walmart was a delightful experience. Extremely flexible hours and understanding management. Coworkers were very pleasant and treated each other like family.
good,It all really depends on the location (as with any other job). It is a very good entry level company to work for. It offers many benefits as well. Several locations have the issue of not advancing dedicated individuals.
good,"No hay crecimiento, limitan mucho al momento de crecer dentro de la empresa"
good,Easy going culture where no previous experience is required. On the job training will easily help with the required skill set. If you arent with the organization for many years there is little room for advancement.  Since most positions are entry level a rigid professional culture is not thoroughly enforced.
good,This walmart in particular was an okay place to work they were fun and friendly there but was very unorganized. You can barley find a manager when you need them. The bright side was they made sure that thier employees and customers came first.
good,Walmart has helped me a lot grow as a sales associate and a person. Helped with my communication skills and my abilities to help people in need! I would say my job is fun but to me I feel I need something more outgoing or challenging!
good,"Constanly  learning "
good,a day at work was helping costumers with all of there eyewear needs. It was a steady fast pace day. I learned many thing about the eyes. I enjoyed working with different people everyday
good,"It was a good place to work. I liked all the other employees, the managers, the hours, benefits, and pay. They are real fair and encourage movement within the company."
good,"Could not talk management into proper tools to do some of the jobs that needed to be done, they did not care about there Employees in the automotive shop."
good,Walmart is a good company. The issue is the management. The people they have in place work off of emotions not for the growth of the business. Store Manager was rude and unprofessional. He showed a lack of appreciation for his workers.
good,I liked being outside attending to bring carts back from the parking lot.  I got to help many customers load their groceries and purchases into their vehicles.
good,"Very professional environment, everybody was kind and you knew what was expected of you on a day to day basis, and for the most part you were given the tools and resources you needed to fulfil."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the job done at a timely manner and satisfy the customers. I learned to how to retail and become open as a person talking to customers.
good,They schedule you 3 weeks in advanced which is great especially when making plans but they had a first come first serve when it came for asking for time off which i never liked but experience was great
good,"Overall my experience working for Walmart has been fine. It is a pretty productive place to work. Job duties are pretty straight forward but it's WALMART, so patience and customer service skills will take you a long way and save you a lot of stress."
good,"Pretty good job, you get plenty of hours when you begin & the pay checks are pretty good but it is hard to try to convince management for some days off."
good,"Typically enjoyable experience, most of the managers were flexible except for a couple of them. Co-workers were easy to get along with and the system would flow pretty smoothly. Little to no technological errors and most issues were fixed relatively quickly."
good,Great place to work. Pay is ok nothing great. Atmosphere is pretty good. Can have a life outside of work so that's a plus. Overall great company to for in my opinion.
good,"Will spend hours fixing things other shifts mess up, then come in the next day and do it all over again. Management never does anything about it because it is not their problem. It is a physical job because of how many tasks you are assigned to do. Is not a boring job either, day goes by very fast because you are busy all day long."
good,I loved working here with people from different backgrounds. I enjoyed the flexible work hours and the pay isn't bad. I could alwayscome to work focused and knowing what I needed to do to be successful that day.
good,I like Walmart as a company. This company wants everyone to succeed and to move up in the echelon of responsibility. One thing is sure is not not all the stores's management the same.
good,"Working at Walmart in multiple positions gave me opportunity to learn more about the company and get experience in different areas."
good,"Management could use alot of work with helping associates, and falling through with their words. But besides that benefits are a plus. "
good,A great place to work - lots of employee help and encouragement. Sometimes the hours can be long in order to complete incoming merchandise although this usually only happens during holiday season.
good,"Walmart used to be very good under the operation of Mr. Sam Walton. Nowadays, the company has been changing a lot and I feel that my wage does not equal to what I do for the company. Work pressure, lack of help from management, work load is too much but the payment is not what I expect."
good,"I was surprised I liked working at Walmart. I really enjoyed work and the people who I worked with at the time. I get along really well with most people, so the whole time I was employed there, I had maybe 3 grouchy customers."
good,Walmart Could be a better company if they listen to their employees but overall a cool place to work I would recommend my friends and family to work there
good,"Wished I had my job back. Loved working there for the most part, pay should been more for what was expected.  Need to be more drama free! Mgmt changed"
good,Walmart DC is a good company to work especially if you’re looking a job with great benefits. My shift had trouble with management so I didn’t have the best experience
good,"Good team members, change of management wasn’t the best idea, employee and shift cuts made the job much harder. But an overall good experience. Due to personal reasons I was forced to relocate in short notice."
good,Not a bad place to work if it’s only temporary(no more than 5yrs). Great for college students. Not sure if it’s even worth trying to make a career. Good luck trying to get benefits. Your only able to receive benefits if your full time. They’ll give you just enough hours so you won’t reach full time and qualify for benefits. Be prepared to work every position if hired. Just because you’re hired for cashier you could be stocking shelves or maintenance
good,"The environment and overall enjoyment of working at walmart really depends on your attitude towards customers and towards co-worker. It also depends on your store. The management can be stressful and cold but some people there can also be nice. If you want a place to strive in and be friendly, you can do that. If you want a place to clock in, do your hours, and go home, you can do that as well."
good,"The only problem is that nobody save for management is allowed to work full time, leaving most associates having to work two or more jobs in order to support themselves."
good,They are a good company to work for. They try to work with every situation that you may have arise and work around it to accomadte you better. If you show your a hard worker and reliable you get better guaranteed hours.
good,Walmart is a nice jobs to have they pay ok and they know how to treat their employees respect wise. It's just sometime employees act more professional then management.
good,"Whether its busy or not, there is always something to do to help the day go by. Coworkers make it a fun work environment. Management could be a lot better."
good,"With better management and communication, it would be a great job. Working on the front end and being told to do one thing from your customer service manager but then being told to do a completely different task first by an assistant manager because they feel their task holds more weight can be somewhat overwhelming. Half the time I wasn't even doing my job as a cashier because they would place me somewhere else"
good,"The job was linear.  Same thing everyday.  What kept it interesting was getting to know the co-workers.  The hardest part was the lifting.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers.  It was a good workplace.  Management was sometimes tough on the employees, but always complimented the bad with the good things that the employees did."
good,"It’s fun , coworkers are fun to work with and I’m happy that I have great coworkers ,who also love their jobs and to have fun with work and to helping people with their experience at Walmart better"
good,typical work day consisted of cleaning aisles and helping customers find items. management constantly changed and were unorganized. very friendly and ethnic coworkers. most enjoyable part of job was talking to new customers everyday.
good,"refilling the milk shelf, stocking the eggs,cheese,yougurt. cleaning the freezer, customer service and helping the other employees "
good,"The fact I never got any of my over time hours pay ! It’s still a really good company to work for ‘ teach you a lot a lot Customer  service . I’d de work here"
good,"Walmart can be a rewarding place to work. You simply be willing to show up to work on time, keep a steady pace while working and also be willing to interact with customers."
good,Walmart was nice place to work at. The only thing i didn't like about it was how the some of the managers talked about us being behind schedule and but they never really tried to help up
good,While working there was indeed an enjoyable place to work. was always being micro managed. My experience was decent. Upper management did not back up my discipline of employees.
good,"I love working retail, the Walmart I work at has a very poor upper Management team. My peers are fantastic.  The new things Walmart is trying is going to push a lot of current employees away."
good,"The environment is hectic and there are usually not enough Associates to handle all that needs to get done. Otherwise, helping the Customers in whatever way they need is always satisfying."
good,Lots of different teams and departments to work in.  Hours are not stable for hourly employees. Will increase around Christmas to full time and then go down to 2 shifts a week in January till about June.
good,Work everyday hard and learn about has much has posible of warehouse process including inventory handling the merchandise and re stocking it or stocking it in the sales floor
good,"Really like working at walmart always had something to do whether it was inventory, stocking, helping customers, setting mods/prices tags, never not doing something highly enjoyed that"
good,Okay job for a college student that was easy to apply to.  Don't expect to go home for breaks. Make sure all on site training is done on time and before the end of your first six months.
good,"Provides leadership with exceptional learning in their roles at the Academy.  "
good,If you work hard and prove yourself there is lots of opportunity for advancement. It’s hard to balance work and life since this company is open 364 days a year
good,The questions are simple and straight forward. They thoroughly explain your job duties and title. They are nice and can be helpful. The Walmart family is welcoming and friendly.
good,I think with my few months of working there the workers there were actually pretty friendly. This was one of my favorite jobs even if i was just a cashier. I was always happy to come into work and work with some of the people i worked with.
good,"Not terrible if you need a job.  If you put forth even a small effort, you'll shine like a bright star cause most people don't.  They get a lot of bad press, but have been good to me"
good,The mangers was not really helpful and some the people that was there wasn’t helpful they was really all for them self and they had favorites they let them get away with anything and everything
good,Necesito más beneficios y mejores oportunidades para mejorar nuestra economía
good,walmart was good if you wanted to try different things and wanted to start working there as a first job but there is no place to make a career in. they pick and choose and not always for the best
good,The experience was overall positive. The responsibilities provided in my role were engaging and varied. I considered myself part of a team and had a lot of support from my fellow employees.
good,"Working with the customers. Work environment. Opportunities to grow."
good,There was no genuine connection between the employees and management. The hardest part of the job was the call volume. It was extremely high with incoming and outgoing calls.
good,Es buena y tranquila solamente cuando empieza la temporada en algunas sucursales se vuelve a algo caótico
good,"This is the easiest job I have ever had."
good,"Working as a CAP2 associate was physically demanding and your job is very important to the company. It has decent wages but like most retail stores, the upper management makes or breaks your jobs environment."
good,"In my time at Walmart, I never really felt that necessary. I was simply a cog in the machine. My only concern was coming to work to get the job done. It didn’t bring any sense of family atmosphere. It was very, machinelike. Everyone had a purpose, and if you failed to complete it in its entirety, you were replaced. Nobody really cares about anyone else. You’re just there to get paid"
good,It’s a good work to have as a first year worker everything is so smooth flexible hours.Also Management it’s really good with employers.They like to work as a team.
good,Management didn't communicate the best at times but the environment and my coworkers made up for the stress I had with the job. I worked as a cashier and most of the time I loved it. I loved being able to make my customers laugh and have a better day on their way out.
good,"Colaboración, honestidad, paciencia y entregado al trabajo jamás tendrás problemas, ( si buscas relajación y sin compromiso laboral, no es recomendable)."
good,Managers often lack communication with one another and pull associates to work on other projects instead of the one a different manager asked them to do and leads to unfinished projects.
good,Walmart is a good place to work but work hours are too short to provide for my family. More young people are coming to work there and all the elderly are leaving.
good,"Ok place to work. It has its pros and cons definitely. "
good,Tienen muy buen ambiente y te entienden sineres estudiantes
good,"The pay is great however the work can be difficult, there is next to no forgiveness for attendance regardless how long you've been there. great benefits."
good,Nice and beautiful working atmosphere. I loved working at Walmart and will love to continue working there. But when I needed assistance to transfer my HR wasn't there to help me and I ended up forced to quit.
good,"Awesome job enjoy working there they treat the employee fair and enjoy my job. It was something different for me because could different work previous years,"
good,I can say that Walmart pays good but they dont care for there associates at all they don’t take doctors excuses or care about anything important going on they don’t accept anything no excuses they will fire you with no hesitation
good,Walmart was the only place that would hire me since I haven't had a job prior. I learned a lot from them and gained great experiences working there. I always wanted to improve and they gave me that.
good,Let all spread love for this 2020 season and beyond. I need a job right now please lol real talk tho. I love working for Walmart. They are a team for all
good,"É uma ótima empresa, paga seu salário em dia tudo certinho, nenhuma reclamação de funcionários e pessoas de dentro  da diretoria, pelo contrário somente elogios. Mas vc não muda de cargo de jeito nenhum."
good,"I enjoyed the hard, honest work I was doing before my MS diagnosis. Management and staff there have all been very supportive of my ongoing fight with this disease. I've learned a lot about proper stocking techniques while I've been there."
good,Honestly it's a good job if you're willing to work hard. The pay is good and they offer raises often as well as bonuses based on warehouse performance
good,This is a work environment where motivation and focus is of utmost importance. Never losing track of what's going on or things get thrown into chaos. The people here can be very helpful but the customers may get on your nerves. You must be cool-headed to work here. but it is fun once you get the hang of it.
good,The company that I worked for is overall a great company to work for but they can have better managers to managage (never got to take my breaks for the time I was given)
good,"Have worked there for almost two years the first year and a half great, currently hard to go to work new manager in charge , has no.people skills, rude disrespectful,  not a likeable person."
good,The great thing other working for Walmart is rhe many different departments. It gives you the opportunity the learn many areas and also move up in the company.
good,Working at Walmart is easy transition for someone like me who had no experience in a retail atmosphere the training was quick and easy a little bit over-the-top but overall good the stable inn reliable hours
good,"Working for walmart is based on each person personal need."
good,From the time i started to my last day there Wal-Mart underwent several changes from removing Sunday premium pay to implementing the point system and reducing several job positions within the store.
good,"Based on the daily deliveries it set the stage for the unload processes, this was non-existing. Reviewed the next days deliveries for features, special orders and event items for planning purposes. Working with various members of management for day, afternoon and night was challenging."
good,Made good relationships with coworkers and also always had enough work to get through the night and stay busy. Room for advancement seemed fair as well.
good,"Its decent pay and good for anyone, but very stressfull..depends on the manager. Some will help you learn new things and take on new roles, but some just sit down all day and dont do anything."
good,"At my Walmart, we are really close. We help each other out and over all it's a really great place to work. Manegment is really great and understanding."
good,"This Walmart company is just as if you walk into any other Walmart, you get what you expect out of the staff members for the most part. There is nothing spectacular about this Walmart location"
good,It was a decent place to work the customers where awesome the hours where ok my coworkers where saportive I'm a people person to getting to know the customers to help them find what they need or to just help the was really fun for me
good,"Es un buen lugar de trabajo, pero muy mal manejado hay un exceso de tolerancia que provoca desigualdad entre su personal y las decisiones de gerencia casi nunca son las adecuadas."
good,"I enjoyed working overnights, time went by fast, and management respects employees, as far as I knew. I would really enjoy working for Walmart again soon"
good,Great place to work and move up with the company .. I started out as a cart pusher then went to an unloader and then garden associate and the manager of three different departments...so I know alot of areas
good,I loved my job and what my responsibilitys were at walmart. Met good people and the customers were great. It was fairly easy to catch on to the work load. And i enjoyed learning from my co workers.
good,There are a food truck and merchant truck that comes once a day I work in the back room. Stocking was a cool thing to do it's not a rush 8hr shifts give mr time to do everything correctly.
good,Management could be more respectful but other than that it's a great company. Walmart definitely needs a better security system because of all the theft that happens there.
good,"Great for coming in as a first job, easy to move along with the company, for the most part very fast paced and an excellent place to meet different people and if your looking for that team coordination its there. Not too much of a challenge once you learn your position."
good,Just like the title says okay place to work you get paida food wage  are okay shifts but the people that work you work with they don't pull their weight
good,"A somewhat great place to work, but has it's pros and cons, You just have to weigh in what you want. Work and life balance is hard working here. You work Holidays and no time spent with Families. A typical day is spent on your Toes for 8 hours. You get 2 short paid 15minutes breaks and our 1 hour Lunch Break. Every day is challenging depending on which department you are. Some Management are awesome, some are terrible. And some much expectation as with all jobs. They cuts hours at wills lot, and then they expect 2 Associates to do some tasks, that could have taken 4 men."
good,"I loved working there, the managers were decent and the job wasn't that bad. The job keeps you busy, theres always work to do. I had to leave due to personal reasons."
good,When working you had to work fast and efficient with a smile and friendly attitude. When your job is done there is always another task to be done. Management made sure you always had something productive to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was my fellow associate and the team i was on.
good,Customers are wonderful and most are good wholesom people that will help you push through the day. Alot of the management staff are caring compassionate individuals.
good,Walmart is a good place to work for with a very caring team. It is a good place to proceed in life with having good communication skills and management opportunities.
good,They are always changing and are trying to do the right thing. The down side to that is as they loose employees they automatically assume the next in line to pick up the work instead of hiring someone. If you work for them you will have to assume many hats and it’s ever so changing in a bad way!
good,I like walmart as a company and i understand their busniess directions. Fit for the future it a motto that is true. I am looking for more real world work experiance and the next step up.
good,"When 1st started working, I got 32hrs a week. After about a month it changed. Was lucky to get 14hrs a week.  Then I started taking shifts to make more $$. Then I was offered new positions within the company.  I believe because I show up and do my job. Now I work 4 days a week. Have weekend's off. If you do your job ask questions if you don't understand. You will be rewarded"
good,This job was very bad and stressful the management team will not help you in any way they will always tell at you or cut your hours because your not doing what they want from you
good,The front end is usually always really busy either that be on cash or customer service. On a daily basis you are bound to encounter some rude customers.
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work,  I had a really great staff.  Many of my co-workers had been with Walmart for more than 10 years. I feel that you can grow with Walmart if that is something that you desire.  You simply must show interest."
good,It was a good company to work for. It was high pace and had good hours. They were flexible with hours. They have good benefits and also vacation time. You can also accumulate paid time off
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Walmart until the Management staff began watching me constantly. Watching cameras, following me and even monitoring my bathroom and lunch breaks. I couldn’t  even use the restroom without being interrogated. Ask any employee there and they will say I was a prompt and hard working employee. Managers will make sure that if they don’t  like you, you will either quit or be fired."
good,"I learned how to be effective with customer service and run a cash register     Had some issues with management because of my dad and I feel I should be monitored alone as a person and not because of who I am related to"
good,Will bend over backwards for you if you are a good employee best place i have ever worked at ! A large opportunity to grow and move up! I'm looking forward to going back in 2 and a half years when my daughter starts school ❤
good,"Fast paced environment . Skills i had to access was time-management, communication, and active listening skills. High demand of duties to completed within the time of the shift. I enjoyed communicating with others in the friendly environment , i also enjoyed being apart of the company's organization."
good,"Walmart can be challenging at times. I worked there for 6 years and honestly never thought I would leave. A change in management drove my decision to make a change. They are flexible with hours and days off. The pay is decent, especially for minors."
good,Su administración y trato a empleados es de buen agrado
good,"I worked at one location for over 14 years at many different positions occasionally felt overwhelmed but always had a sense of accomplishment"
good,"I’m three months in now and it’s pretty stressful but I do get paid time off and benefits so it’s still better than my last job. Only problem I have is the management, except me to do a lot of work as fast as possible by myself but if I was in another location I would probably like it more."
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart. The pay was great for the job but the hours were terrible. It’s like the hourly pay was good but you couldn’t seem to get enough hours.
good,"Working at Wal Mart has its benefits and drawbacks. One benefit is that it has a productive work environment.  No matter the weather, the job will be finished."
good,You make the judge of how your day will go.  The hard part about the job is when associates do not come to work and areas are short staff but the best part is when everyone come to work and a team.
good,"Job be on time and do your job"
good,We could work more as though we’re of a unity or family/teammates whereas the job would be easier and less tense. Also customers would be moreover happier due to associates being more relaxed.
good,"Pay was good, benefits were good, very challenging, "
good,"I feel like it’s easy to move up if you show you can do the job.  I feel like the managers can let their emotions get the best of themselves.  Overall I think the company is good to work for , I think they should be more careful who they make managers."
good,"Pros- Walmart has always been good to me and my personal life.  I have alot of friends I've made there and 95% of the time I like my job"
good,"Unloading truck every day can be very difficulty, paired with the high expectations and fast environment, it can really tire a person out. The management can be very hard to work with at times but there's always someone there to help you, and nice workers."
good,"I would probble still there if it wasn't for the poor management team at the"
good,Most people can't handle the job. 10hr days back breaking work for those who can b on the go back n forth all nite. Very strict on everything making it a safe work place. But not appreciated for the work being done. Manager communication between shifts is horrible. not the best company!
good,"My time at Walmart was mostly enjoyable. They were flexible with majority of my hours and the employees they had were wonderful to be around and also encouraged you to do better. The customers there were mildly difficult to deal with, but like I said previously my co-workers made it incredibly better when we dealt with difficult customers"
good,"is not the worst place to work, however not the greatest either.. salary is decent if you don't mind working a schedule that is constantly changing ... good people to meet as well"
good,"I actually enjoyed my time there, they have a lot of positive perks for workers, the employee discount isnt the best, but they teach you other ways to save money. They promate a family /team environment and seem to have several employees that work there for decades."
good,"About Walmart company is a good company for work, with great benefits, but if you are a young person, trying to get good money and reach high personal and laboral goals you need to find another company for work."
good,when I first started they were very flexable with working around your schedule but changed to working only there scheduled time you have to be able to work any shift now
good,Job with advancements if you're willing to work for it. Competitive pay and associate programs. Good Warehousing work if that is your interest. Comparable and consistent work hours.
good,"though imperfect, a family oriented company. overall, a busy atomsphere. management lacked in some areas. must be open to working in multiple areas. some good benefits."
good,"fast paced, production driven, quarterly bonuses, excellent training program, managers are fair but not likely to work with you. job is physically demanding and due to the size of the warehouse(2.3 million square feet) expect a lot of walking."
good,This job mainly requires the employee to have a smile on their face and just go through the motions. There typically is nothing excessive to do. Would suggest wearing comfortable sneakers with cushions soles since you will be standing/walking majority of the time.
good,This was a very easy job. All I did was make sure my team was clear on the guidance of the day. I handled price changes and overstock as well anything they asked me to do.
good,"working at walmart was a good learning exp. i enjoyed working there."
good,It was exciting at first but all these new managers and new rules were to come about . They didn’t care about how their employees feel and they just talk to you any kind of way .
good,"Could always have something to do regardless of the day, over a wide array of tasks such as cashiering or stocking to even psuhing carts. Never too much to handle."
good,"Es un excelente lugar de trabajo, aunque los salarios no son los mejores, se compensa fonmkuchas otras situaciones como el apoyo que dan para casi cualquier situación"
good,It was a very welcoming place to work. Everyone was really nice and they always tried to get their jobs done quickly as possible but with good quality.
good,"I checked out customers on a point of sales ystem. I loved my job. On my way home from work a deer ran into me and totaled my vehicle. It took so long for the insurance company to decide what to do, I couldn’t depend on somebody else to get me to work."
good,Was a good company. Not enough qaulity help. The upper management relyed on dept managers to do all work that wasn't done by regular associates. Did not give enough time for dept managers to do their job
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, but huge stores can be unorganized sometimes. Management is poor. Good hours most of the time . Hardest part About this job is some people may have an attitude with you."
good,Buen ambiente laboral pero poca promoción sin importar tu experiencia!
good,"The job itself isnt too bad, you meet great ppl and some entitled people, you get to see a different side of reality. Everyone should at least try retail to see what the other side looks like"
good,"Fast paced ,always something to do ,meet new ppl daily days went by fast ,issues with promotions though , stressful a lot of being short handed gotta be light on your feet"
good,"The job is easy if you're going for cashiering or self-checkout host, its not bad. But if they try and put you in the coolers, ask for either another position before you agree, or just don't work in Bessemer in the coolers. They treat their employees in the back like nothing."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work. it slow pace if everyone is doing their job right. management are friend and approachable. benefits are great but salary is not.
good,"Easy advancement, good pay, clean friendly. Open door policy with management. Great learning environment they send you to the Walmart academy to Foster your education and increase your likelihood of becoming upper management."
good,The other employees were nice and helpful. It wasn’t too much work and i never got tired of it. The management team there was always available and flexible when it came down to changing schedules or helping when you needed them to.
good,Great company with lots of support for associates. A few bad managers mixed in but overall good. Poor work and home balance as you go higher up with the company.
good,Liked going in we would unload the trailer it take about 2 hour for each one some thing 2 truck in total and a truck in grocery after that we hit the floor and stock til it time to clock out finsh early clean and then zoon I thought I was there best employe from the unloader
good,"I have been working for a while as overnight receiving stocker associate in Alvin (TX) although my primary job was in the I. T. field. So, for me was like playing a game: pretty easy but lot of efforts for sure. Enjoyable environment full of colors, music and good teammates. The salary is not enough and we are not payed depending on our performances."
good,Es una empresa que me ayudo a crecer y el campo la lavoral aprenti a conoser todolo relacionado con el area de supermecados
good,"Great team, really enjoying working with and getting to know them. Really great start to work for. It was good while it lasted. Just feel like I should move on"
good,Great work family. Lots of different opportunities. Erratic hours & few employees become full time. The aforementioned means many employees do not have health insurance due to not eligible through Wal Mart but make just enough to not qualify for Medicaid or afford the marketplace.
good,"Working for Walmart has been an experience worth taking, I have learned many things and meant great people who are looking to better themselves as a person. If you want to move up in the company it is your discission and management will not put more on you unless they feel you are reliable."
good,"clock in and help ring up customers I learned a lot of self management and how to manage people, sadly managers are not as professional as i would l like but work was work and it was fun, the hardest part was management, I loved selling products to customers."
good,"When I worked there I didn't exactly feel right with the company. I loved my fellow employees, regulars, and the job. Management wasn't the best and the pay was low at the time. Improvements have been made in both areas, so I'd recommend working here for sure"
good,"I am happy with my job at Walmart. My fashion team associates are great to work with. I feel I am treated fairly.  Management is good. Except for  a couple. But, that is pretty much wherever you work. I  feel the pay could be better.  After Christmas my hours go down. As a part time worker, I am guaranteed 12hrs/ week.  So now I am working 3 part time jobs."
good,there's a bunch of favoritism in Walmart. some things that happen just get passed over when problems get reported. and management need to work on their communication
good,"I only worked a short time at Walmart as a Cashier/ customer service employee. Its your typical job, show up on time and do your job, type job. Be prepared to miss your breaks or lunches due to you and maybe one other cashier at all times. "
good,With working in a multi billion dollar company sometimes certain things become a priority and that was customers. I have learned how to grow within the company and also as a a person. It has its ups and downs but what job doesn't. Holidays aren't all that great but i can say once its over its all great from there.
good,"I like it here but it is very hard to pick up hours/ get any hours during their slow season. I loved the employees, a lot of them work their heart out to be where they are in the store."
good,"Walmart is an awesome place to work. In pharmacy, pharmacist work with you and your personal life to ensure that you are getting what you need done."
good,"I enjoyed working at the service desk where returns, refunds and many other things are done as it stays so busy at all times and it's very demanding. However, that's why I liked the Service Desk. I did not care to work the registers on the floor. I had 4 or 5 things that I was getting accomplished at the same time and to me that was fun, kept me on my toes and held my attention the entire time which of course, made your day go by faster. Management was satisfactory, hours & pay had room for improvement."
good,entrevista entrega de documentos evaluaciones spicometricas
good,"Excelente empresa, aprendi muito no período que trabalhei."
good,"Stock area, keep area clean, fill photo orders that came in through printer. Assist customers if they needed help. Call customers and let them know their orders were ready for pickup."
good,"great place to learn and move up. hard work . Must be willing to multitask. Move quickly and be a team player. Be on time, be ready to work, bonuses by quarter"
good,"The actual job of stocking merchandise itself was easy, but there are lots of customers who will come up to you with many questions and/or want you to take them to the exact location of an item. This takes up lots of time from doing your job and finish stocking all the merchandise from that day's freight. The managers are very strict about finishing your task on time and will quickly give you a coaching for not finishing on time. This mde it it very overwhelming most of the days.m"
good,"Very easy-going atmosphere, however very unlikely to advance unless possessing certain advantages. Very cooperative with balancing work and personal life."
good,As a whole i enjoyed this job all though i did find it somewhat difficut to move up or around in the company for some and not others so that did seem a bit unfair almost like being at a big high school separating people into certain groups.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work with great benefits both long term and short term. The work environment is welcoming, however, the management needs to be more well rounded and trained accordingly."
good,"Its a pretty fast paced job and you can learn a lot about retail also learn a lot about people. The culture is very diverse some people are nice others are rude. The hardest part of the job was staying busy for me the most enjoyable part was learning how to operate fork lifts, scissors lifts, walkie stackers, electric pallet jacks just a good first job experience and i learned a lot."
good,Engage with mismanagement and your Co workers and get to know your job well. So u can perform. At the best rate possible ..ask. question if you don't know something
good,"My supervisor was hardly ever around so you have to have self control & discipline when working in ""OGP"". The coworkers i came in constant contact with in my department were terrible. some of the nastiest personalities I have ever worked with. The treatment was not fair nor professional. I would recommend the position under different circumstances."
good,I loved working for Walmart and would still be there if family issues didn't arise. I would refer any friends to apply for this company. They also have a great retirement plan with other benefits and stock options. Great company
good,Job was good was very enjoyable. A lot is done by employees and I was one of those people who had a lot to do. Even on slow days you could easily be kept busy.
good,"I liked it there, they told me I hired as full time, but accidentally put me in as part time, so I got my year in and put in for vacation, it was approved and I went on a trip. When I got back I found out my vacation wasn't paid for because I was part time.  The human resource lady admitted that it was her fault but Walmart still refused to pay my time off so I quit."
good,"Great job for everyone. All ages. Benefits are exceptional! Had a fabulous 5 year run...very rewarding, great team members...more like a family. However, the company has changed...some may argue for a future assimilation based on self checkout and online orders, which is eliminating customer service based positions. I left on a positive note."
good,"In Walmart, the environment for working is very busy and we have to manage customers and other tasks as well at the same time. The whole management team is very supportive."
good,I worked at Walmart twice & both times I was terminated.The first time I think I could of handled the situation better.The second time I felt I was wrongly terminated.
good,Yes it is better then other but the salary is not good management is good they cooperate with employees but the rate of returning  the items is very much and due to it company has to suffer loss
good,It’s a little fast but managed pretty okay you work with great people they are kinda like a family with is really nice the managers could use some work but overall a great bunch of people
good,journée de travail agréable pas trop de stresse. Une équipe solidaire et à l'écoute toujours là pour t'aider et que tu te sente à l'aise
good,Working at walmart is too stressfull.  They put too much work on one person to be able to get every penny paid to them.  I only stay because of all the benefits they offer.
good,"If your thick skinned, and you work hard, go above and beyond, then you'll probably shine over most of the people at Walmart. I work hard, but only about 1 day a week out of the 5 i work, i might up it to 2, but probably not."
good,Earned forklift certification while working here.  Gained customer service experience.  Accrued paid time off and protected time off.  Benefit package for full time employees.
good,over all experience with the management is excellent. but the way how they make schedules is really bad. work life and balancing life is very hard. except that everything is good.
good,"Walmart is a good job especially for a first time job. Its a bit stressful during the holidays because customers get really angry but overall walmart is easy on most parts especially getting the hang of working there, management are really good with people. Ive learned a lot being in retail, what i love the most is stocking,"
good,This is a fast paced job that is ever changing and evolving. The work life. Balance isnt so great with the requirement of needing to work a minimum of 50 hours a week while usually blowing past this.
good,I learned how to deal with customers while providing the best customer service possible. Management is not very good about making sure every employee knows new and sometimes necessary information which is frustrating at times.
good,"When you’re a full time associate, you are offered insurance, guaranteed 40 hours and PTO is accumulated faster. You’re better off being a full time associate rather than part time."
good,"Work/life balance wasn't working out there. I was hired for full time but ended up needing a part time position. In the end Walmart became ""walmart needs first"" and didn't fit my needs. Plus time off is extremely hard to get, you need months in advance to get the day you need."
good,"Though this company has terrible reviews by many, I found it to be a decent place to work.  The management wasn't great, but the employees were generally pleasant and fun to be around. I felt as though the company (not necessarily my store) truly wanted me to succeed in life, and at the company."
good,The workplace culture is great. You'll get to meet people every day from everywhere. Then in the lunch roomthere a big screen TV that everyone can enjoy while eating.
good,Enjoy working for the company.  I have varied responsibilities that make the day go fast.  Enjoy serving the customers.  Walmart stock inventory at multiple price points.  Thus there is something for everyone.
good,Working at Walmart has its good points and bad points. The company itself is okay to work for but I feel as though management cares more about making money than it does about its employees or its customers. Very hard to get time off when you ask for it so many employees quit or get terminated for attendance. Customers are generally pleasant enough to work with  as is management
good,"I liked Walmart, other then the fact that I was hired on for dry products, but when I started I was just in the frozen room and freezer area. I hated it, I asked to move multiple times but they refused."
good,I enjoyed my time with walmart. I was here for 2 years and I tried to keep my nose clean but some of the other workers like to start drama and one worker started drama with me and tried to stop me from leaving to go do my job but I was able to get in my forklift and drive away so the worker claimed a fight between us and even though the cameras showed there was no fight I was fired along with the other worker.
good,Long work hours is the typical due to staffing and turnover.Advancement is available from hard work. Hard to make goal with a lot of new people in orientation.
good,It is a comfortable entry level job.  Walmart provides job training and benefits to full-time and part-time employees; including an employee discount card to all employees after six months.
good,"Communication with other associates, lots of lifting, great management, have to follow safety rules, learned to have customer service skills, good overall"
good,It's a great company! Very professional environment with great chances to get promoted and achieve better positions. It's very challenging and it's a company with values and focused in goals.
good,I like what  i did. we had 3 different managers while i was there. The way it was run in our department changed a lot over time.   It started fun but everyone got competitive over time off and breaks. sometime we had to stay late. We had to cover shifts so it was hard finding a way to work sometimes.
good,I would work at Walmart again but would definitely want higher pay to be able to pay my bills and daycare. It was a great work experience and I thrive in busy and fast paced work environments.
good,"I was hired for the Christmas season, but stayed longer due to lack of manpower at the store. Everything was like clock-work during the normal smooth days. "
good,Due to my Injury I was let go. I did have a second job at the time at UNO but everything sorta worked on its own. I had no complaints I would recommend to anyone in need
good,This is a fun and exciting job. From building displays and taking care of customers. Lots of Metrics and flexible hours for all ages and nationalities.
good,"Overall I had a good experience working for walmart. Other then one manager, management was willing to hear about any issues that were going on around the store.  It's a friendly work environment and can provide you with the knowledge you need or want into the retail world."
good,Learned to inventory and stock shelves. Learned how to judge produce for sale. Received stock on delivery days. Assisted customers with finding products or to offer advice on merchandise.
good,"Learn a lot at Walmart. Good managers. Busy work, constant movement. Loading and unloading trucks. Stocking shelves. Helping customers with carry outs."
good,"I loved working for Walmart until my life circumstances changed.  I loved interaction with the customers  The team work with the other cashiers, we really help to motivate.each other to be the best. The management was concern about the employees professional and. Personal concerns.."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good job but the people there are not people I would trust. They act nice in person but talk behind yoir back, it pays good but is stressful."
good,"Starting out I didn't think I would be here long. "
good,Ok buena empresa oportunidades de desarrollo y carrera
good,"working at store level you have to be prepared for anything.  as long as you have a strong leadership team, the jobs can be very rewarding.  working with the public can sometimes be a challenge."
good,My days at Walmart go very productive. I learn better communication skills at Walmart. Management at Walmart is appreciable. People at Walmart is very welcoming and friendly. As a greeter I sometimes found my self less experienced for back store activities. I enjoy interacting with people most.
good,"Worked as a seasonal employee for the holiday season. i absolutely loved it and got 40 or close to 40 hours per week. After the holiday season hours got cut by over half and i got moved to a grocery position, which i was not hired for and did not enjoy at all. I eventually decided to leave because of this."
good,"Buen salario y facilidad para ajustar horarios, sin embargo, algunas personas con puestos con más responsabilidades no tienen buen trato con las personas a su cargo."
good,"Schedule was flexible"
good,Would unload morning trucks full of produce with hand jack would take it to the fridges separated and rotated product according to date older to the front newer to the back and would load carts and stock merchandise on the sales floor while taking out bad and expired product.
good,"I was happy to be granted the position as a Pharmacy Technician and truly enjoyed the work being done, however I do feel the need to progress and move onto bigger and better things for myself."
good,"As I have worked with this company for three years I can honestly say that the job itself is not all that bad, management is just not the best and don’t treat their employees fairly."
good,"Super easy job, nice people because most of them are regulars so you see them often. It’s rare to get an upset customer that’s mean or tries to make your day worse."
good,It’s an ok place to work. I would still be there but my baby had to flu and I had no leave time and no one to keep him so I had to make a decision. I really miss the company.
good,"Good to work at walmart. Learned and cleared training sessions. "
good,De l cultura Walmart puedes aprender varias cosas y trabajar en el lugar es bastante agradable
good,Walmart is one of the largest companies on earth. Walmart is a great place to work. Everyone kept smiling faces and worked as a team to get day to day task complete. Great opportunities and chances to move up in positions. Unloading and stocking is not a problem at all. Although the management team is not the best. They could work on that and that and be more organized and act more like supervisors
good,"This job is a hands on job, and that is one thing that interested me the most. This job keeps me on my feet and keeps me working fast. I also love the fact how I learn new things each day and I can bring it to future reference."
good,I loved working with very knowledgeable people in the pharmacy.  Flexible working hours. I had always worked in hospital pharmacy so this was a new experience working retail pharmacy.
good,"If it were not for some unforseen issues. I would still be working here. Yes some issues do arise, but if you are doing the right things, someone always notices. If a hard dependable worker you will do just fine."
good,Working as a door greeter is slow and sometimes boring but other areas are more fast pace liked meeting new people and talking to the ones that return time after time
good,"it was work. not much to say. the pay is ok. good hours for me at the time."
good,"It was a good experience and i liked helping people around the store find items they needed and couldn’t find them, they were directed and polite once taken care of."
good,"I have been introduced to many people my age, and I tend to get along very well with my coworkers, who all have outgoing personalities, making it so fun to be there. However, current department manager likes to cause drama, takes a ton of smoke breaks during the day, making us pick up her slack, which stresses us out a lot."
good,Very nice people and respectful customers and very fast pace but decent pay and great benefits and understanding management and caring bosses and loving people.
good,I loved my job at Walmart. It wasn’t the job. Some of the other management didn’t like that I was a manager. I felt it was a problem with ethics. Walmart is a great company to work for.
good,I was a sticker for 2nd shift and the job was relatively easy. The work was slower paced and didn’t require a lot of brain power and unique skills to get the job done. Very straight forward
good,Hours differ from hours offered for work with no reasonable explanation. Goal expectations don’t match time frame in learning. Assistance for employee access could be better.
good,My five year experience with Walmart was never a dole day.  One day you can be in AP and the next day in AR; or even TAX.   Walmart is constantly restructuring and trying to implement new technology to drive innovation and sustainability in the work environment.
good,"Most positions pay fairly for work load. Employee discount, insurance, and yearly pay raise. good benefits for retail. There is some lack of communication between store associates and upper management however. Resources available to you as an associate are not clearly given outside of first week of training that covers part of what Walmart provides to their employees."
good,I enjoyed work most of the time. I worked produce first then started helpin out in meat and deli. Meat and produce were my go to and I hated being in the deli although I was good at it it was understaffed and the others were not as clean and thorough as should have been.
good,Hours were going to be cut..personal reasons why I left. The company is good fair..i wasn't there long enough to experience any benefits. I feel the front end could of been more helpful.
good,Can be accommodating to your life schedule  paid vacations. Good dental. This has always been a good work place for me but it is a work place with business needs. Must work holidays which is unpleasant
good,"Empresa boa com bastante benefícios, salário muito baixo"
good,I enjoyed the job in the beginning but my begin to get cut especially when I needed 40+ to become a full time employee. I felt as though I was lied to during my interview.
good,It was a good job when i was there. I love the customer that came in to Wal-Mart. I love work counting the draw down and putting people where they go.
good,"lots of ways to learn new skills and improve skills you already have. friendly, helpful staff almost family like will help you in times of need. no better retail place to work."
good,"I will say this, there are some good people at the Walmart I worked at. very few bad managers, but overall a good experience. The managers do need to address the lack of communication and responding over radios, and that I feel bad for them when I left. The bathrooms will never be the same. The hardest part was honestly the bathrooms just because there so many people just keep coming in. Other than that, it was fun walking around the store spotting messes in the store and dealing with them before they can even call you for it."
good,"The first thing you would do is check-in, of course, put on the correct attire for the job, including a jersey and a name badge. Afterward, I would set up the pallets and the line for the truck to be unloaded. Once the truck arrived we would get in are designated positions on the line and categorize boxes by departments on the stores on pallets (stacked neatly and safely). Sometime I would be the one to throw or unload the truck and get the numbers checked into the computer. Next, I would do cloth processing, or stocking or the floor in a multifarious of different departments where I would give excellent customer service to individuals who needed it. Every so often, when needed I would operate certain machinery such as a forklift, etc. to move things in the back rooms off the shelves. Toward the end of the day, we would pull the merchandise on the pallets to the floor to be stocked. Sometimes we would stock the merchandise if we had the time to do so, or they would be left for the overnighters to stock. if everything was finished we would either zone aisles or collect carts from outside.  There was no particular difficult part of the job, maybe then rather unloading the boxes of the truck yourself depending on the size of the truck. The culture was friendly and had a lot of diversity. The management was sub-par; certain things could have been recognized more, such as work ethic or safety. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job would be some of the people I worked with and operating the machinery. It gave me something to stay focused on and I was rather good at it. Like I"
good,"I enjoyed the work I did at Walmart. I answered phones, and helped customers when needed. I organized clothing kept my station clean. I made tags and labels for clothing and accessories. "
good,"This was a good first job i had. Back then when i worked there at 2014 the pay was awful. However, back in 2016 they made a new rule to raise the wage for all workers. So no big problem anymore..."
good,The management was great. Everyone was helpful and fun loving. However there is no room for growth. I only worked there there during high school......
good,"hours went by fast, constantly learned new things, managers not afraid to get in and help do a task, enjoyed the hard part that is always on the move."
good,"It is a strong job, but rewarding with the pay, you must be a person who can work under pressure and in a team, work for productivity and competition day by day is about breaking previous tracks."
good,"I had a good time working there. and I was glad to have an hour lunch, even though the job isn't too demanding and you get to make some goof friends...."
good,This is a really good job if u are Abel to work at a steady fast past and Abel to help at the same time as completing your own job task. Must fallow rules and be Abel to understand the role you are given
good,"Se agradece poder trabajar en una empresa donde culturalmente se pueda trabajar desde la casa y el clima laboral es muy bueno."
good,Laid back in most areas. It is harder to make production in others given the inconsistency of the trailers. jobs that require any type of unloading are less straight forward.
good,Good job to get by on. Employer does not take in to work life balance and don't accommodate needs to support emergency life events. Staff was great otherwise to work with.
good,They gave me a seasonal job but I wasn’t supposed to be seasonal but they never fixed my hours. It was never my intentions to stop working there but they took me off the schedule completely.
good,Walmart was my first job I couldn’t complain.That job with work we cause I was in school. Walmart is a really good place for your first job they are flexible with you .I really like working at Walmart I injoy it a lot and I made a lot of friend and meet new people and amazing customers.
good,Good environment to learn and use your skills to enhance process flows and positively impact the overall business.  Great co-workers as everyone is a pleasure to work with.
good,"The company overall is a great company to work for, the management needs to treat associates in better manner.  I  believe in team work and at times it doesn't seem to matter to other associates they are there just for a paycheck"
good,Walmart is an okay company. There are good and bad with the company. It has good pay. The  benefits are good. You have opportunity to go forward with the company.
good,Was an interesting job. I recommend if your looking for full time its in the nite shift only. Day shift is all part time. And the customers are funny and always important.
good,"They pretty much hire anybody so if you’re looking for a job here, just show that you’re actually willing to work. It’s not bad but it is retail and not all managers are great. The managers each have a different way of thinking and would tell you to do things different ways instead of the “one best way”. You can move up but only people who actually work, which is a given. Most days in my store, I had a lot of overtime but most stores won’t ever allow that and you would have to cut it. I have worked there for four years and the only time my pay matched my work was when I was promoted to Support Manager. Otherwise than that, the pay was too low for the stress. They’re doing away with a lot of positions, including mine, which is why I left but I honestly would have stayed if they didn’t."
good,"In a small town who's business is focused on factory work, Walmart is an excellent alternative.  The pay is good and usually the hours are plenty.  Weekends are required sometimes."
good,"I loved the management team and the associates there, I've spent 12 yrs with the company and I felt it was just time to close that chapter in my life."
good,"Walmart offered the ability to work close to home and as well was able to provide a safe working environment with many opportunities to advance in the workplace. There were times where I struggled to meet demands yet the management team was lenient in their managing, and helped guide me to find more success during my work."
good,It was amazing at first I love talking to customers and staying busy but they would not work around medical appointments or my school schedule. They gave a attendance policy where you are only allowed 4.5 points and I had to call in for school twice and they chose to put that as two of my points.
good,Nobody wants to work as a team or do as their told by their managers. Been even told to do things that is against the law where you could get fired for too.
good,"I worked at Walmart for around 4 years and I had a wonderful experience. Yes, the pay can suck and the benefits are just terrible BUT the people you work with are amazing... or at least the ones I worked with were. We were a family. I left due to lack of hours and my manager refused to allow me hours regardless of coverage. She has since left as I hear but it was still a poor experience at the end of it all. You will be required to work Thanksgiving weekend, it is mandatory unless you are one of the lucky few who just so happen to not get scheduled. The holiday season is also extremely demanding, exhausting, and busy but like I mentioned before, your coworkers are what make everything worth it. Lean on them, rely on them, confide in them (with what you feel comfortable with) and remember... It's WALMART. It won't ever be pretty but it's a job."
good,"Normal day"
good,It was everything including a multicultural experience to me....great working experience!  Want to reunite this season!  I would promote this company to others as well!
good,"Walmart is a very nice, slow, then busy kinda work place. Hours are limited to their convenience. I recommend working there if you want something simple and easy."
good,"Love my job a cashier, helping customers and hearing their stories.The compensation was not great, however I enjoyed my job, Some things were high priority and others should of been. The culture their is mixed no problem I get along with every one."
good,"great job overall, some managers make it super tough to get stuff done."
good,Walmart is a company that fronts. Nothing is as what they tell you when you first start working there . But the pay is good. I just can’t work there anymore because I moved cities.
good,"Its a stress free work environment at most times. However, there are a lot of employees who think they have an advantage over other employees who have the same position. I do recommended this job to anyone who is a college student due to flexible working hours."
good,"A typical day as a Walmart associate is always being on your feet and always available for the day ... That means customers first and area developing and organization second... "
good,Had a issue with a asst. Manager...I was still in tranning ask Him about how to do something and He Told me He didn't have time to help me an had a disrespectful additude
good,I am a personal shopper so I shop for the online grocery customers.  Management helps if needed.  Other associates in the store are also crossed trained to help if needed.
good,"normally understaffed but everone tried their best to keep everything going. lots of cleaning and returns. customers tended to be very nice as well as co workers,"
good,It was laid back was my first job while in high school so I was happy about that. Co workers there help me have a good work ethic. They was always positive and we pushed each other so it kinda helped me become a hard worker.
good,"A day at work would include me putting away freight from the previous evening truck"
good,"The job was overall easy work, you know what's expected of you from the start, but it doesn't always stay the same.  Hours are inconsistent at best, but company policies change frequently and not always in the benefit of the employee.   When management stops caring about their employees the environment entirely suffers.  Change in store management, job position availabilities, and hours ended up with many people losing their jobs or leaving them.  The new store management at the particular store I was at sent the store environment downhill. Management was not always there when you needed them to be. Almost everything is out-sourced so going to HR usually results in a 'you have to call this number and talk to this other company's representatives'.  Employees with disabilities are not looked out for as much anymore either.   The pay is great for my area starting out, but cost of living vs pay makes it average out.  Benefits are great, but you have a period of time you have to wait before they are active. Many employee positions changed or were cut just in the time I worked there."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work. The management treat you well and provide flexible scheduling for you, too. Probably one of the best places that I've worked at."
good,"empresa com salário bom,horários por escala mas gerencia deixa a desejar"
good,The benefits are the only reason to work there. They do care about their employees but not when it comes to upgrading equipment.  Like I said the benefits are top rate ...
good,"It was and ok job, you were on your feet all the time and they kept you busy, and if another department was not staffed you helped out wherever needed"
good,The Walmart team was very helpful to it's customers I would love to work there again. The personnel wasn't the greatest help after moving and management could be a little better.
good,"Loved people and managers I worked with, the job was fairly easy for me, could do more than just my job, helped out in other departments including the customer service desk, taking returns, money Gram etc, trained new front end employees"
good,"Really nice coworkers and the overnight shift can be enjoyable. If you're able to stay headstrong and reliable, you'll do fine here. Don't let others get to you and keep your chin up!"
good,"Poor management. After constant tries of moving up. Working hard, staying overtime, working crazy 4am-1pm & 2pm-11pm hour shifts and still didn’t get the recognition I properly deserved. I (fairly) got interviewed for Customer Service Supervisor once which is what I had been aiming for since the beginning but did not get the position. After that, my manager started using my hunger and motivation for the position as leverage towards harassment."
good,I enjoy working at Wal-Mart. The other employees are friendly and there is a real sense of belonging and being part of the team. There management are very approachable and easy to talk to
good,"Loved working there , enjoyed my coworkers and enjoyed the experience. "
good,"Walmart is a fast paced environment.! If you want a career in retail Walmart is the place to work.  I personally had a different experience. If, as an individual you want to become manager you can at walmart."
good,"My experience while working at Walmart was a good one. The environment is faced paced, which makes for a busy work day. There is also a lot to learn. And they will train you.  I enjoyed meeting people from all walks of life. The pay isn’t adequate and the raises are annually. But there is definitely room for advancement with this company. Overall it wasn’t a bad place to work."
good,"A typical day at work usually went by fast"
good,Being a typical cashier has its ups and downs. Having to deal with a guest that needs a price change but is in a hurry can be a challenge since you have to wait for an override. CSM are helpful and keep you going through your shifts. They answer everything you ask.
good,"It is a very good job but there are many areas to improve, Unfortunately they do not do doping test. They give employees a discount after 6 month, we have 401k."
good,This is a Great place to work. Sometimes people are overlooked for position due to limited time at current store instead of based off experience and time with company.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Enjoy the people there, relatively small crew. Work can get stressful due to it but we have each other’s back. Management is pretty good from what I get to see. Makes the night go fast. Wish they paid more then what the starting is, and that is was a bigger pay bump as the years went on."
good,Walmart's a good job with benefits and friendly works its a place where u can move up pretty fast  and can learn a lot for workin at walmart...................
good,It was good for the most part. Pay always on time two breaks and evry month they would have cupcakes for those celebrating their birthday. you will need a lot of free time because around the holiday you will have to work 6 days for a few weeks.
good,"Well I started and it was a very fun experience. You like hard work? You get it. Wanna get payed to do nothing and gossip all day? You get it. Unfortunately, both those types of people get payed the same. I worked hard, met some cool people, etc. But I quit because of the management at the time wasn't very honest. I'm not low iq and know when people are keeping on the backburner and lying. Anyone can become management here, even dumb people, which was the problem. "
good,Walmart is a good place to work. I have work there for 7 years and worked my way up to an assistant manager. They have great benefits. They match your 401k up to 6%
good,Better respect.  They should bring a daycare for walmart works. Every body she get respect no matter what they job title. Some employees spend most of they time at work then home. It should be a big family day for Walmart works.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is like all business, it was work orientated. We came in did what we had to do. We helped out workers whenever things were slow, then we went back to our jobs."
good,"A fast pace environment but rewarded. Great management, and the store manager a great person that is always available with the policy of open doors. The rules and policies are the ones that made things a little hard to move to different departments."
good,Work would be steady every day except for the holidays. It could get stressful. Management was helpful when you needed them. Other co-workers were pleasant for the most part. I liked that I got to work with people all day long.
good,Your week is usually pretty busy.  You have your everyday duties plus more. You always want to make sure the customer is taken care of and that you help the associates when needed.
good,Decent pay for the job.  Schedule is not always right.  Job is very dirty.  Work well with school schedules.  Store discount.  Always have to work holidays.
good,"it could be a nice place to work but one must pick the right store."
good,Working in walmart DC 07006 is  relatively safe. There are always some unfriendly aasociates but overall I haved had no problems working here for the past 27 months.
good,"Probably best for an in-between job. Would not have been worth it if not for the people I worked with. At the time, it was minimum wage, but I've since heard that the wages were raised and the duties altered, so it's more likely to be a good job to stay at if you like manual labor and repetitive tasks."
good,"this is a great first job. it allows you to interact with the public, as well as have business experience. it is a good paying job. but the hours can vary from week to week"
good,"Not that bad of a place to work. I worked at Walmart in St. Mary’s GA and I was asked to do layaway almost a month after I just got hired, which I really liked. Then I was promoted to customer service, which is a lot better then being just a cashier. The only part I did not enjoy is the drama people I worked with would have and a lot of people did not like me because I just got hired and was being promoted when people that have been there for a few years we’re stuck in the same place. I even had a manager who I really looked up to promote me to customer service and then when someone asked her about it she told them she had no idea how I got promoted. Just keep in mind a manager has to approve the job change and she clearly approved it. When her and I talked about it beforehand she told me to keep it a secret so people wouldn’t get mad at her then she tried to act like she had not part in promoting me. It was weird. But other than that, it’s a good job if you’re a hard worker and want to advance."
good,overall a good place to work.  culture has shifted and is not the same as it used to be which has led to alot of long term associates leaving the company to pursue other opportunities.
good,"The managers have good standards, they help with putting out stuff.they are very respectfully n they communicate with each other. They mean business when it comes to the job."
good,Company constantly changing but only new associates are getting more from the changes versus long term associates. Expect the unexpected all the time.
good,Great place to work any shift that works for you The hours are great easy work great people to work with keeps you busy very good on giving you personal time
good,"Working there was good, it was only that some members of management were using there title as “managers” as an advantage to do whatever they wanted. But besides that most members of management were nice and leadership worthy."
good,"Walmart provides a flexible schedule that will work well with busy people. You are able to change positions and hours if you talk to the managers. As an employee, you work with your coworkers to accomplish given tasks."
good,"When I worked, they were looking for more hours from me. Management can be unhelpful sometimes, but depends on who the manager is. Work environment is a little fast paced especially on weekends and closing shifts."
good,Se aprende mucho de las distintas areas y el contacto directo con los consumidores te proporciona gratitud
good,Normally you go in you cap bins. If there fresh freight from night shift you half to put that up as well. work fast depends what department they want it done at a specific time.
good,"I would be a back stocker, making sure the juices were stocked for the customers . helping customers find what they needed. making sure the yogurts were not expired."
good,"Your'e on your feet all day just standing and greeting customers and checking if they have all the items on their receipt. Customers can rude at time and not want to show their receipt but, as part of the procedure as a door greeter you are required to check all receipts to make sure no shrinkage is happening to the store."
good,If the management was like my other Walmart I would had stood longer but this Walmart @ Fall River has been the worse I’ve ever work for. I hope I can find another Walmart I would like to
good,"I learned to Establish performance and service goals and hold associates accountable for individual performance"
good,"The management was nice, and it was a great environment to start my working career as my first job. I am still friends with several people from there."
good,They were ok management wasnt the best. The bonuses were great. They need more help with registers and associates. Most of the co workers were great also its a great experience for some people
good,I m really enjoy working at walmart which is a giant grocery company that afford good incentives benefits and advancements for the employees.but my character personnel loves to explore new fields this was the main reason that pushing me to put this application in your company plus the good things I heard about working for your company
good,This job was perfect for getting your feet wet when jumping into the work force. Teaches you customer service care and how to deal with people in general
good,"A typical work day at walmart is helping out any customer that needs help with assitance or directions. I learned alot while just being in the short amount of time. The management is great. Also there was nothing hard about this job, it was my first job and i loved it. I enjoyed being apart of a work environment."
good,Walmart is a great company for starters but if you're looking to stay in the long run you'll need to and get to higher positions. I enjoyed helping customers as i could kind of help them at my own pace. Management was great there.
good,"Walmart de México es buena empresa para tu primer empleo, los pagos son puntuales, brinda horarios flexibles para estudiante, en cuanto a sus detalles a mejorar son sus protocolos de seguridad."
good,Strong culture of caring for the customer and having a productive work environment.  Comfortable working space with collaboration areas and ability to focus.  Management styles vary by leader and can be overbearing.
good,I learned very good customer service from this job and how to be consistent. Although it was hard to work while in school I’d recommend it for the pay.
good,Working has had its challenges especially with management. Thus company is all about structure and making sure we are doing it the Wal-Mart way. But they dont really give you any time to get a grasp of it or to try and fix turnover so you can learn and adapt.
good,"Several areas to work in and multiple shifts. Most areas are production.  Good pay, however the work is very physical in the production areas. Promotions and job transfers available."
good,Its a good starting job. It can be a fast passed place to work or it can be slow depending on the day but it intrsduces you to people and gets you working experiance
good,It’s as good as you’re willing to make it. Sure there’s some things that could be improved upon but it’s not a terrible place. Easy to move up if you make an effort to do so.
good,Was a nice job everyone was very nice and friendly. The job really helps with social skills I would decently recommend it for a shy person and the pay is worth the work
good,"Walmart isn't exactly the place i'd recommend if you have bad feet, but otherwise, depending on management of course, it's a pretty okay place to work."
good,Respectful place to work. Many opportunities for hard working associate to be promoted to leadership roles. Varied schedule presents some issues with quality of life.
good,Empresa con mucha experiencia en sus procesos. Al ser tan grande uno trabaja con muchas áreas y hay gran aprendizaje.Buena cultura organizacional.
good,Always have open availability. No dress code unless inappropriate. Quarterly bonuses. Always busy unless put into a slower paced area. Continuously helping customers.
good,good work place. would recommend if going to school or just want to have a part time job! but not for a career unless you want to become a co manger then yes go ahead!
good,It was what I needed for the time being. I enjoy the family environment there. The front end was always pretty busy. We worked as a team. Some days was very challenging.
good,Walmart was fast paced rushed and I felt in pressure  I just need somewhere good paying so I can go back to school and really do what I want to and be very succesful
good,"At Walmart there was free dress on the floor, we had a meeting everyday about 5-20 mins. before work. The description of work needing to be done for the day was easily understood from the manager(s). The hardest part of the job was stocking after unloading the truck (18-wheeler), because the time left determined how much time we had left to stock the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being left on my own with a task to complete."
good,Walmart has floating work hours per associate which changes week to week.  Hours are directly associated with sales and profit.  If the store you are working for is not making sales they will cut hours.  If sales are in the green then the hours wont be cut.
good,I loved working there I was very comfortable managers were great they worked with you. Only downfall was when I was switched to remodeling I was not told.  But working with the remodeling team was a very good experience .
good,"Great company to work for. Well paying company. Always putting there customers first is key."
good,"I do like my job and most management but the physical aspect, for me, is becoming more difficult. Have tried to transfer but no luck so far. Been there 9 years"
good,It's like high school sometimes. Manager was great but overall could be more competitive when iy comes to pay rate. Everyone in the auto care center thinks they're a boss and knows everything.
good,"Great starter for building job experience. Good source of income. If you are permanent and need be relocated, they will give a hand and help to find the next best possible location."
good,"If you can survive working for Walmart, then you can work anywhere. Walmart will equip you with the fundamentals of job employment. You will be disciplined to arrive to work on time and finish task in a timely and efficient manner. Perfect for youth trying to transition into adulthood. A great stepping stone."
good,I made the mistake of not maintaining separate records of my attendance at Wal-Mart and I fault my error for my termination . I enjoyed my customers and socializing.
good,I learned how to work the mule they use to collect carts and i always had team members to help with task. Management is okay but it could be better. The benefits are really good though.
good,"There isn't really a typical day at work in Asda some things happen each day but some days anything can happen to make it interesting."
good,"This work was okay, and the benefit was not the best. I liked working with other people in the cashier drawer. CMA was okay but sometimes they did not get along with you."
good,Great place to work for. Management can be a little funky but just deal with it and move on because you are there to do a job and do it correctly. Other co-workers may get different treatment like favouritism. But all in all great place.
good,You always have to be prepared because everyday was different for me. Some days I would stock and others I’m a cashier. Some days is business and others aren’t.
good,"my immediate supervisors and managers were very supportive and helpful and i learned a lot, and i also loved the people i work with. however, the store is understaffed and overstocked to the point of freight just sitting in the warehouse unable to go out because nobody applies to work at walmart so almost every department is understaffed. the store is a mess because of this. but good pay per hour and good benefits. but overall good work experience."
good,"Hard work but fair, good teamwork,  mgmt varies from location to location,  having hard time transferring to new location to accommodate family needs."
good,It's a job. U can advance. Sky is the limit. If u are a go getter this is the place for you. They do work with you on your schedule if u need that. Overall a nice place
good,Working for Walmart was a great experience.  There were lots of advancement opportunities.  You work every holiday except Christmas.  I worked with some really great people.  Customers were mostly friendly.
good,Walmart has really stepped up to help create jobs and develope culture. They try hard to drive teamwork and work with people. You will work very fast paced in various departments and hours are not guaranteed and pay is at very minimum with very little increases through tenure. It’s not a very rewarding job but it will keep you employed and has benefits as a strong surviving company.
good,Glad to work there family at that store wish there more ways to help people with leave due to family issues that aren't medical was able to advance quickly jobs changed all the time
good,Working for Walmart I have learned many things. With Walmart I had an opportunity to lead and guide new associates. Training them to become the best associate they can be. Walmart taught me a lot about customer service and how to handle stressful situations.
good,"Walmart gives a young person the best look into the public workforce, starting them at the lowest position, but offering easy advancement. The simple training instructs you what to be on the lookout for and makes you more aware of the stresses and difficulties of an hourly retail associate."
good,"Very good culture here for young people, however the pay was very low for the work that they wanted us to do. The management staff was ok to work for and they did try to make it easy for us at times"
good,Always be on top of your duties. The more you know about your store and department the better. can be a very enjoyable environment if everyone is working as a team.
good,"A mix between an enjoyable and stressful workplace. I learned to go with the flow and work whatever job was given to me. I enjoyed having a variety of things to do and learned something new every day, however at times it got to be a bit stressful. Having many people to work together was always very helpful and there was always an associate or customer to help make your work shifts more enjoyable."
good,"I enjoy working there, the employees are friendly. And the supervisors there are fair. It’s a great work environment. I enjoy it, there’s different ethnicities and a chance to meet new people. Gives you a good experience in the work field & opens up new opportunities!"
good,Walmart was fun very fast passed during the Holiday managers can be unfair at times but pay was very good and would work there again if same position was available
good,"Depending on where you work in the store, there is ZERO support from management.  You will be treated like a work-mule, with no consequences, if you attempt to point that out to management.  The work is fun, most coworkers are good, customers can be interesting and benefits are great."
good,In the 5 years I've technically worked at Walmart seen 2 black Fridays and have unloaded said trucks aswell as stocked almost every area of the store at least once.
good,A typical day at work was stocking shelves. Worked over nights so they expect you to work fast. Thought the store i worked at had a good work place culture.
good,Walmart is a great start to earn and learn more about your own possibilities in for a future and they are willing to work with you no matter the issue.
good,"After transferring to a second store, my experience with Walmart began to fail with the lack of knowledge coming from management. The years of experience from Associates were greater than that of the new management that was hired and as an Associate, I felt we were training these new Managers that were supposed to be in charge of our departments."
good,"Good starting pay. Often people call out then management push more expectations on to the workers that came to work. Training could be better. Some leaders need more training, either they are lazy or don't know what they should know."
good,At Walmart we had minimum downtime other than the few breaks they gave us every couple hours and were expected to stay working at a fast but steady pace.
good,Working at Walmart is a preference be sure if applying make sure it is something you will like to do and will have fun to do through your work schedule everyone is really nice and friendly there.
good,Working here is a great start to learn multiple task to get you prepared. The tasks keep you on your feet and is a hands in environment that helps you learn fast.
good,"fast pased not enough help wouldn't rehire me based on my experience"
good,"Honestly its not a bad place to work at, it treated me fairly and was recognized for my work ethic in more then one occasion it a great place to build a resume if you are willing to put the time and place."
good,I really think management needs to do better with dealing with their workers and treating everyone in every area equally because I feel when your environment is good and work as a team things flow better team work makes the dream works
good,"Liked the people i worked with alot. It gets busy during holidays and such but, i had fun in what i did. There were days were i had trouble understanding some tasks that were given to me but i got through it."
good,"I had a pretty good time working there. The pay was great, I made friends, the customers were friendly and I liked the atmosphere. My main gripe was my supervisor and a few associates I worked with. My supervisor played favorites and made my job in receiving so much harder than it had to be."
good,High intensity pace can be stressful at times.  Pay is competitive for this type of work.  Culture greatly depends on the management team.  They can make or break your experience.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for as long as you have a good management staff.  Some managers feel they have to be mean and miserable to get the job done.  Make you do things that go against one of the core values Integrity.
good,"Walmart has high standards when it comes to its employees, requiring both speed, customer service, initiative, and especially attendance. Once you start working there, they expect you to be present when you are required, and not after, or even before. They’re also very testy about initiative which I’m not exactly sure what they are looking for."
good,"I unloaded semis, Forktruck operator, Easy once you get the hang of it. Did it through college. Sat-mon Nights. Pay was well starting and went up in the First 6 months. 12 hour shifts and your moving sense you start."
good,"A fun place to work as the people are great in general but you have to really be committed to want to stay with lower pay and more. Management was understable but not always in tune with what was happening."
good,.....stressful cause our store couldn’t keep the lanes open for nun it used to be 3 lines pulse self checkout ... they never had any night shift the stock people had to run self checkout all night
good,"The management was horrible but the overall job was pretty good . Loved the department I worked, Felt like management took advantage of those who actually worked"
good,"I enjoyed being a team member as well as working independently as a team leader. Setting up displays was challenging, but also was a chance to use your imagination. Being manager of the arts & crafts department was fun and interesting. I learned how to complete projects,baking techniques,floral arrangement, sewing with or without a sewing machine, and many other areas of arts and crafts."
good,"Typical day at work just consists of talking with my co-workers while stocking shelves, and after that we pretty much just make the store look presentable for when it opens at 7 am."
good,"I like working with my co-workers and helping with customers."
good,Helpful innovative and a relentless pursuit of bettering our future.  Change is very fast paced information is constant must be available and able to adapt quickly.
good,working here was pretty typical. the management could have been better. there was poor team effort as well as poor decisions from management. also no offering of any great benefits at the time of employment.
good,"They prefer to ""Hire Up"" from inside.  It's barely possible to move up if you don't know people and started there.  As an external Asst Manager I'm on the outside of the click.  This adds a level of difficulty that shouldn't be there.  If the Store Manager understands this and helps with the transition, this can be a great starting step."
good,Walmart offers flexible schedules but it can be challenging to have a good work/life balance. There is also plenty of room for growth if you're willing to work various hours/shifts.
good,more benefits better paying jobs looking forward to learning more things in life other than retail need to have more experience more on hands jobs around the world around the United States
good,you would have a meeting at the beginning of the work day and then go to the maintenance area and prepare the machines for that day. sometimes the managers pulled me to go stock shelves when they needed me to. And I loved it. I learned to use a pallet jack and a card board ben and a hand held scanner to locate where an item goes. Sometimes you will have managers that were cool then sometimes they weren't the nicest but that is ok. They are not there to be friends but to get a job well done. The hardest part of the job was some of the other workers there. Sometimes other workers just don't know how to show respect or work ethics and work like a team member to get the job done. I loved working around different kinds of people and learning new things all the time. I like hearing new ideas and knowing how to do things differently. Everyone has a different way and opinions and that is ok.
good,There are plenty of chances to learn multiple department and there are extra training provided by the company such as first aid and power equipment training should you choose to take it. There are not very many opportunities to advance within the company and the environment can get very toxic within the co workers. Management is horrible at communicating with each-other or with the employees. Overall not a horrible place to work at.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart I liked to spend time with the people I worked with. I learned a lot about the machines I had to use. Such as the buffer and scrubber to do the floors. I also had to pressure wash the bathrooms.
good,"I started with Walmart back in 1983 I left in 1986 to go to back to school for retail management and marketing went back in 2004 as a dept.manager stay until 2010 due"
good,"Enjoyed many years there - changing to meet new customer demands. Many jobs being eliminated "
good,Just do your job. Don’t understand ask Questions. First day pray you get someone who’ll train you and  Patient with teaching. Everything is fast paced but working you have to help customers. Always show up for work on your day or else well you’ll find out. Has long as you do your Job you’ll do just fine.
good,Walmart was a good place to work at and learn basic skills for doing well in the work place. It taught me a lot about being professional and take the job serious.
good,"Some days would be fine, a little slow but always busy when it came to lunch and closing the deli. the hardest part of the job would be going into the freezer and lifting 50 lb boxes from the top shelf."
good,I enjoyed working there it was fun and repetitive but I did think we were getting paid enough a lot of us was cross trained and was only getting paid for 1 position which the position you are hire as I was promoted twice but the attendance policy is ridiculous
good,"As a cashier, I tried to keep my head down and just do my job. A typical day at work has you see all sorts of people from rich to poor, nice, rude, bigots, and openhearted people so that was pretty cool because 90% of the time customers were pretty chill. If you get a customer that's being difficult however, management has you bend over backwards to make them happy anyways. Coworkers spend too much time trying to do anything but their jobs. Too much idle time, even the CSM's kind of slack off. Being a student, I needed them to change my schedule often to accommodate my classes. Management had me working full time hours as a part time worker. It felt like management didn't really see any sort of humanity behind their subordinates, kind of treated us all like drones."
good,"Great work environment, where  you can learn a lot make  friends  and  meet all types of  people from different walks of life. If a position is not necessary for you, you have  opportunities to transfer to your ideal position,  or location  for  more  convenience,  great discounts for  employees on merchandise, lots of paid time off just over all a great place to work."
good,"management need improvement, need improvement with scheduling. There are so many changes going on.   I use to love working here, I will stay if wasn't looking for career growth, I no longer want to work in retail my education is not in this field and I do not see myself making this out of a career."
good,They pay well. Most of the employees are helpful and polite. There is a casual dress code making the job a bit more comfortable. They will work with your schedule when possible.
good,"I began as a cashier. Then I transferred to deli, stocking, inventory, and finally working at the Customer Service Desk, where I continued to work until I relocated to Florida."
good,The overall experience depends on the people that work with you. They either make or break the experience of your job. I was fortunate enough to have met very good people here.
good,Friendly environment. Tasks are not too difficult to complete. Very strict on the attendance policy. Management is very kind. Good about giving a good schedule
good,"At first I really liked working here. I was at a Super Walmart and started before the store was even opened. I did my online training (3-5 days) and then did some receiving in the back until the store opened and I started as a cashier. You had to be cashier for 6 months and then they decided whether they let you go or put you in a department. I was wanted by three different dept managers so I went with the highest paid dept, which was deli. I liked working in deli for the first year. I worked there about 13 months. After one year, when I was able to and did sign up fro my benefits, everything went downhill. All of a sudden, I was getting in trouble for other being being gross and not cleaning well enough. But I got a write up because I WAS THERE, you know, to do my job. So I was written up for the other girl not cleaning the area she was cleaning (I was cleaning the front and her, the back). Then I got written up for the sandwich case not being full when I had like 30 sandwich orders I had to complete first. It's impossible to do both when you have that many orders. They need a secondary person to do the case on weekends because there's no way. I was told by another associate that our new dept manager (the third I had in 8 months in deli) was told she had to fire someone and that's why the heat was on me as I had just started getting benefits. I'm not one to make excuses. I go and do my job to the best of my abilities always because I have bills! So then one day I came in to make my sandwiches and there's no bread. It should have been baked the night before. So I had to grab"
good,"conveyor machinery seems to malfunction a lot. "
good,"It has its good days and its bad days, just like any other workplace.  Management needs more diversity training."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in at 8pm, have a staff meeting, go over what we’re going to be doing for the night. Head over to the area of the store, wait for scorpions, attach the scorpions, move the counters, wait for the floor people to redo the floor. Then go stock, move other counters for the night."
good,"I worked at Walmart for almost two years in Fremont, NE. I had a great experience as an associate and then as the Cap 2 Supervisor. If I could get that job back I would in a heard beat."
good,"I like working there it’s just too far for night shift, nothing really wrong it’s just stressfully when you have to take a bus everyday from far and you have to make it work"
good,The area that I worked in was very demanding but also time consuming. But I still put pride in my area despite being short staffed. After sometime the demand became more to do more work in less time and wasn't quite possible
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. I worked customer service for 6 years and everyday is different. Management is very professional and understanding.
good,"Long days.."
good,Walmart's a company that's growing and evolving to stay ahead of the curb with technology and new ways of thinking for customers and associates alike.
good,It's a good place to work if you want to build your career they are always updating the way they do things so you have to be able to adapt to new rules and regulations
good,"Great place to work "
good,Walmart is always busy so there will always be a high demand for workers. There are times when we don’t have enough staff for the amount of customers we have so it can seem pretty crazy in there at times. Overall I think I’ve had a good experience working at Walmart & I’m grateful I had the chance to learn from working here.
good,"Hard work load, short of staff all the time, so much shrinking. Still Walmart hires you even with no experience and they get the benefit. Mostly foreign workers, still at times it’s fun to work there. Night shifts are horrible. Morning people enjoy more perks."
good,I loved my job and my customers but the position was boring and it was hard to move up to another position if you wanted to my job was also dangerous and I was pregnant
good,Company offers advancement opportunities. Best opportunities for those willing to relocate anywhere. Currently changing jobs and responsibilities.Fast paced .
good,I had a okay experience with Walmart. Some of the Supervisors should be monitored carefully. Due to none training on how to treat associates and customers
good,"Primarily production-paced retail established environment. Hard working individuals forming a delightfully diverse team atmosphere. Though, at times bit low in associate appreciation, there was an ample availability of benefits, as well as resources for professional and personal development."
good,I loved it at first going to get my things put them up. Unloading pallets until the truck is done unloaded it was all fine. Then a manager wont stop harassing me about how my performance wasnt satisfactory and saying i dissapeared sometimes. So i quit because of the disrespect and didnt want him to fire me and make me look bad. I have talked to walmart and they do not think i was a bad worker they actually wanted me to stay but i refused because he still would have been my boss.
good,"Literally, all you have to do is show up on time and you'll have a job forever. Everyone I work with is amazing and my Cap Team Crew is like a second family to me. I can't imagine working without them! I can only speak for Desloge, MO though. I have a good friend over at the Wal-Mart in Farmington, MO and from everything he's told me, the crew is alot different. They have a higher turnover rate as well if that tells you anything."
good,"The place is awesome! great pay, good benefits, work is pretty laid back and fairly paced. Management is pretty bad though, very neglectful of their employees and it can be extremely frustrating."
good,No one was hard on me for being a newbie when I started but started expecting more as time went on but that's usual.  The people that I worked with were great too.
good,"It was a fun job, but it was difficult physically. Those cement floors hurt. After the new attendance policy and everything, it wasn't worth it to stay. Attendance was rough. And they didn't replace people they lost, they just wanted the remaining people to pick up the balance."
good,I would prefer not to answer.The truth about walmart. A good place to work. But only work ther if you cannot find work elsewhere.  Work there as a last resort
good,I love working for Walmart if you work you can get where you want to be and I work there for two years and I started as a cap2 Associate and now I am a support manager
good,It's easy as long as u don't mind over night or being on your feet a lot. Working over night could take a toll on you if you don't manage your days correctly
good,It was always a job to do i stayed busy which i liked the co workers give you a helping hand if needed we worked as a team i was an backroom associate so we always worked together for most task
good,"It’s a really good place to work at, but sometimes management acts poorly and sets impossible expectations for other associates and stay in the office just to see them at the end of the day before they leave."
good,The managers were amazing and the coworkers were great to work with. I had a wide variety of jobs given to me on a daily basis. If given the opportunity i would definitely work here again
good,"Walmart is a great job with multiple benefits, Pay rate is awesome but when it comes to reapplying the management is not so great with it and they don’t not want to rehire you but if you leave walmart you can apply back in 6 months"
good,"My time at Walmart was definitely a year I will never forget. It took me awhile to come out of my shell but once I did, it was nothing but enjoyable despite being the busiest department in the store. I'm sad that my time there came to an end, but management was top tier and everything that is done through them is completely fair. It was definitely an enjoyable entry level job."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart would like to get my job back. I loved the customers and most of my coworkers. I wish they were more understanding of my situation and weren't so quick to let me go.
good,"Busy workers, fast pace work environment , no hard tasks, 2 nd shift, 10% discount, clean store, good management ,good distance, hour lunch, two 15 min breaks"
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work. As soon as I wanted to move up in any position, they helped it to happen right away. Every Walmart is 24 hours, so there are many times when they need volunteers to do overnight projects. Management as a whole was decent. The training program for managers is thorough, but even still, most of the learning was on the job. Once I became management, the pay was good. The dress code became lax and the tuition reimbursement plan really improved. Like anywhere, it is what you make it. Each store is different, as many of us worked at multiple stores. Embrace change!!!"
good,"I used to not get along with one of the managers there so they moved me to another department, and once I was there I found my place in the company and loved it."
good,"The experience varies with each customer,It can be stressful especially when it comes on to meeting deadlines within the given time for your schedule."
good,Work has its good dad and it’s bad it we all get through it some way. Go to work and play your part is all I’m about. The only hard part about working is the customers are like a non stop distraction to you as your working.
good,"Personally, Walmart is a great company. Starting out, I was pretty excited about working for the company. After some time,  I began to realize that it just wasn't for me anymore."
good,"I highly enjoyed working for Walmart. The training was great and my coworkers were mainly older women who were warm and kind. I got an interview through family friend, who informed me that Walmart was hiring students. Left shortly after the previous students can back for summer vacation - because I wasn't getting as many hours."
good,"It was an great atmosphere most of the time it was great "
good,My job position at Walmart consist of green customer purchase on computerize cast registers assisting self check out and greeting customers and assisting with star related questions
good,Hugh company and offers good benefits. Like any big company you have to be very flexible in order to move up. Their training needs to be improved. Most of it is done through computer.
good,"Good first job, flexible hours for class, got raises early on, they pay 11 now starting in OK. Could use better management tho my manager was good, decent person."
good,I would recommend this job. If only you're made for it. I personally had to quit because they cut my hours & I was only working 30 to 32 hours  and getting paid every two weeks. But If you're just looking for a second job it'll be great
good,One of the easiest jobs I've acquired. Very easy to get along with everyone. Always made sure my job was always done correctly and as efficiently as possible.
good,"Was a decent place to work, with a fair mix of people. Days progressed at a reasonable pace, not too slow or fast. The hardest part of the job was irate customers but management primarily took care of these issues."
good,"I honestly enjoyed this job, it was at a distribution center and not a store so maybe that's why. If you like being left alone, just getting your work done and don't mind sweating then its a great job."
good,"I worked here for over 4 years and enjoyed the work environment.  A typical day at work was filled with joyous coworkers. I learned how to supervise an entire team of staff alone. The workplace culture was diverse and everyone got along. The hardest part of my job was leaving sometimes, because I felt like I could work all day."
good,Walmart is a company that wants there employees to succeed and to achieve a higher position within the company. They will always try to follow their mission statement
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work it is stressful during the holidays, but the benefits from walmart are great. Just for working black Friday you will receive a 15% off one time use that can be combined with the 10% off you already get."
good,As long as you’re willing to relocate and you preform well you can advance with Walmart. It’s very demanding and numbers based the higher you go with the company.
good,"Worked in two different stores in FL & GA. Mostly, Garden Center, and Overnight Stock. The people who work their are mostly friendly, as we all knew we were in the same boat. Underpaid, and under appreciated. It can stressed, but that is usually due to some panties in a wad customer. We did the best we could, with outdated broken equipment. I had to leave due to knee problems, but could of stayed with reasonable accommodation."
good,I needed work and Walmart offered me a job. I had a good supervisor and enjoyed my work and new friends I made there. Would recommend to a friend and the discount was a nice perk.
good,My big complaint about walmart is they require you to use MC40 or TC70 to do your work  but the don't have enough for all employees.To print labels or check stock is hard because of the shortage of TC70/MC40 and printers.
good,"Sometimes you get a good crew, and sometimes you end up pulling all the weight. Management is worked pretty hard at times."
good,It’s defiantly a good place to work. They have good benefits where it counts. It pays pretty good as well I believe they are up to 12 dollars an hour which is high for a job like this.
good,"Apoyo para los empleados,excelente servicio,compañerismo y muy buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Walmart was a very competitive atmosphere. Growth in Walmart's warehouse is based on numbers, the higher your numbers the sooner you may excel. The pay at Walmart was okay."
good,"I always showed up when i was scheduled, always early..never tardy..but i would always be released from my register 30mins-an hour after my scheduled leave time which was very difficult on my home life because I have 2 children."
good,"Design and develop phases of the application using C#, JavaScript, SQL, JDA, PowerShell, Teradata, DB2, XML, SSIS, .Net framework and visual studio IDE."
good,"The management was amazing when I started, everyone was exactly where they knew best, but shortly after the manager for the back room transferred and  it left the fulfillment team with a under trained and inexperienced manager. The work was quite simple though."
good,The company is good to work for but sometimes can have poor management. Depends where you go. Most of the people i work with are great workers and work very hard.
good,Nothing bad to say. If ur just entering the working world then this would be a good hob to build experience. Management was ok when they did show up to work.
good,I enjoyed working 3rd shift at Plymouth Walmart.  We all worked well together .I stocked shelfves and helped whenever I was needed. All the shift managers were helpful and directed me to easiest way to get this done efficiently.
good,"I loved working for Walmart. Excellent benefits and fun people to work for. Only downside is the new store manager Beau who cares about nobody, but himself. I worked there for a year and a half. They have a point system for attendance which allows 5 points or 5 missed days. If you hit number 5 you're fired. Well I had 3 points and got very sick with Strep Throat, Brochitis, and Tonsillitis. I needed 2 days off and he wouldn't approve it. I was termi ated for being sick."
good,"Walmart is a very friendly fast pace working environment . you learn a lot about retail very quickly. We deal with a lot of customers and maintaining a good, clean and safe environment for both ourselves and our customers is a very important daily task."
good,"Lots of standing, bending, cleaning. You greet customers, process transactions and hope you don't get a grouchy-pants in your line but smile anyways if you do. Management is very helpful and pay is decent."
good,"Good benefits, they do their best to accommodate your hours, co workers are easy to get along for the most part. Job is easy, and others are always willing to help when asked too"
good,"I’m really glad that Walmart gave me the chance to work at my dream job as my first job. My time there was enjoyable, some of my coworkers may have not been the best people yet getting along with them was not hard. When things really got hard for me they really stepped in to help me when I needed a hand. It’s a good place for a first job."
good,"As a whole Wal-Mart is a great place to work and, as many do, retire. Lots of benefits and the longer you work there and as your seniority increases there is definitely room to advance as well as the benefits get better the longer you’re there. Pay could always be better but it does pay more than average for my area."
good,"I enjoyed my time working there. I made some great friends out of my coworkers and I was sad to leave. My only problem with them is their attendance policy. When you're new you are given 4 days that you can call out before you are terminated. I came down with the flu and was out for the four days with a doctor's note. They declined the doctors note and told me I needed to apply for sick leave which u did not qualify for. Needless to say, I was fired on my first day back to work after being sick."
good,"You never knew what you’d be walking into when you stepped foot into work, but that was the beauty of working at Walmart. My favorite part was that I gained a whole new family there, and I was part of a team who always backed you up, and that’s what made me so passionate about working at Walmart was the people and the customers you met along the way."
good,"not bad culture good pay, just poor management at the radcliffe asda store, work place not taken seriously and cut my hours due to lack of business and also sent people home when over paid on wages"
good,Wish I hadn't let one jerk get to me and quit. I have regretted it ever since.I am 70 yrs old and use a walker to get around. Walmart was good enough to take me and I screwed up. I have regretted it since. If you need a day off and you apply for it early enough they will give it to you.
good,"Wal Mart is a fast paced place to work there are always more things to get done than you have time to do. It's a challenge. I enjoyed it. My last manager was one of the best people I have ever had to pleasure to work with.They are not all like that though.The pay is fair, Don't know if you could rely on Wal Mart wages alone to live unless your management though"
good,Your job is what you put into it the grass is never greener elsewhere just different grass make what you want someone should tell all these ungrateful associates you have to work to get where you want to be if you dont like the hand you were dealt draw 5 new cards and get out of the way cause the business  has to change in order to succeed so change with it Walmart is a great place to work but you will work hard and if you can survive nothing will stop you from being the best this place grooms people into being the best and just a side note Doug the CEO isn't paid enough and he started as a associate and became CEO cause he wasnt afraid to work rock on Doug do what you do best
good,"walmart was my first job. i loved it. meeting coworkers were cool. i was stressed at first but once i got the hang of it i was good. i’ll never forget my first job because it taught me a lot about myself and others. decent pay, the dress code is so flexible, and it’s a fun place to work. eventually i started to hate dealing with customers and the stress ultimately lead to social anxiety for me. not a place i would stay unless you want to be apart of management."
good,"If you can get your foot in the door and your looking for a career then Wal-Mart is a great place to start.  If you work hard, dedicated, and show interest in total store your opportunity for advancement can be fast paced."
good,"its retail, so there is all the garbage that goes along with retail and it is not the perfect employer, but it gets a bad rap. Its a solid place to work, but would like to see more staffing to assist. Customers range from nasty to extremely nice, although most dont seem to bad. I would recommend working here for many people, although it is not for all."
good,It was my first job ever. The most enjoyable part were definitely the people but at the same time they were also the problem. The work was fine. I stocked shelves and kept track of inventory using a handheld computer. I also worked frozen and dry grocery foods. I also helped customers with any problems they had. I left because even though my fellow associates and some management was absolutely awesome most weren’t. They were rude and disrespectful all the time and my hours would be taken or given away at a moments notice. A few of us had enough and left.
good,I had one of the easiest jobs but what makes Walmart so hard is the people you work with. The management doesn’t really care and everything is a total mess at Walmart. All management like to hide unless there is someone big coming like from corporate. My boss was very cool someone you could talk to but all others weren’t great.
good,I worked in a freezer which was negative forty degree temperatures so I was often sick around a newborn baby. Got written up in my first week due to malfunction of headset from being in the freezer due to a miscount due to the headset not reading my counts correctly.
good,Well I come in and I see what schedule I have for my shift and then I go get my keys. I come up to the front and see if my co works need me to do anything and then I check on cashier and see what register I have open and what I need to take care of through out my day. And I'm there to answer and question my cashier need or my customer in the store.
good,Overall great company. At the time I was advancing in the store quickly which was great . But over the time i found better job and opportunity and that is why today I found work elsewhere .
good,"As an Overnight Associate , I was required to stock new items on shelves before the store reopened .As a Module team member , I reconstituted the sales for to reflect change of season sale display and locations."
good,I started from the bottom and worked my way into department  manager. It was challenging at times  managing several people at once was a challenge and making sure everything was to standards.  I succeeded in all of this and was happy to do my job
good,"As I started to work as a teenager, this was a great job to get to know stocking, cashiering and technology learning; for future job. I would recommend."
good,The two stores I worked at had very good managers. Employees were promoted from within. Training was excellent. You were encouraged to do volunteer work. Walmart gives back to the community.
good,It's alright now but there attendance policy is a joke if you are seriously I'll and can't work plan to be fired immediately the discount are nice though
good,I worked there for around 2 to 3 months and it wasn't bad. It was a good job for a first job. The people were friendly and would help if you had a question about anything.
good,At the time of me working there it was a great environment with great co-workers but management was conflicting with the employees of removing from there stations slowing down productivity when we where short handed or never had enough people on the schedule to complete a task they wanted done in a certain time limit.
good,Walmart was great to work at minus the management and there corporate office. But the good thing is you can move around to different positions there..
good,"A typical day at work consist of going in the back to clock in then heading straight to your register. You help check customers out, answer any questions, and provide the best service you can to them. You also have a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch break. Management is pretty good overall. The hardest part of the job is around rush hour when the lines get extremely long. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and putting smiles on their faces."
good,I won't complain about working at Walmart. It paid the bills for many years. As long as you do what you're supposed to do within the company standards.
good,Overall my experience was good at a Walmart I’m just looking for something other then retail. It’s a great company to work for and good  benefits. Great place
good,"Being a CORPORATION, they are ALL structure and rules.  Very little ""give"" as far as being a person doing a job.  Good training programs,  Good benefits, if you can afford them."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy but rewarding. "
good,Buena empresa con oportunidad de desarrollo y capacitacion constante.
good,"management will constantly show favoritism towards certain employees and also dont evenly distribute work between employees. management also have a bad reputation of not listening to work related problems. besides this it is a fairly easy job with a great work environment, with great co workers"
good,if your looking to make a paycheck in between jobs or just to start out in the work force it is one of the better place to start with. fair warning they do go through a lot of people so there will be nice faces almost all the time.
good,The primary problem I had working at Walmart was that they put the customer over the associate and management. They will allow the customer to treat associates like absolute trash and still reward the customer and do nothing to demonstrate empathy for the associates who are often verbally abused.
good,"Ii definitely enjoyed working at Walmart. They do have somewhat a complicated attendance policy. They don't also accept doctor notes if your sick and need to be out ,they judge it themselves basically, of if they feel if was that serious, which counts against you & can lead to termination if they decide they won't accept your doctors note. If my doctors note would've been accepted, I would still be working there.. But in my case, I also believe had it been a different manager, they would've accepted my note. so overall Walmart was great but some of the managers allow their superiority to take over , just because they have that ""power"". I wouldn't allow that one person to keep me from a job I enjoy and I would still definitely go back. The was 11/hr for cashiers/self check."
good,"Good company would work there again"
good,"Experienced, Hardworking, Honest, Always on time, Have my own transportation, Flexible with any hours, Willing to work any time or over time, never call in"
good,"I'm my four years of working there, it was actually a pretty good work experience. The work itself wasn't very difficult, and my co-workers were very nice people and willing to help one another at the drop of a hat. Management was for the most part, great people, only problem I had with them was that they weren't around enough in my opinion."
good,"Walmart is strict in their attendance, performance, professional policies. They excel at those competencies. The one thing they needs improvement in which is managing the number of employees they have on daily basis. Right now they rank 1/10 in this area because when associates do not show up for their shifts management drops the work of two associates for one person to do alone"
good,"With all the bad press, Walmart is not a bad place to work ! It’s not a job that most people,hire on to be the store GM."
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart, it pays the best in this area for similar jobs and on a whole the work isn't too demanding. My only real gripe would be it all depends on what sort of management you have, if any accountability is present. "
good,The workday was always fast paced but it was always nice to get the know the customers. When the regular customers came in it was relaxing and fun to have conversations with them about the store and about each others lives it was a good way to make conversation and get to know people.
good,"Great place loved my job...Great company to work for. Good environment. People are friendly, discounts, good hours. Cares about their people great first job also offers good careers"
good,"Walmart is a common job for the young work force, there are complications and sometimes seem a bit out of control but it’s the basis of work in general that tells people what they are getting involved with, the company holds good safety measures."
good,The work at Walmart can be tedious and repetitive as can any retail job but the managers are what make the job harder then it needs to be. I have worked at numerous Walmart facilities and it is always the same. Managers try to act like they know everything that needs to be done and how but they fall short. To give them advice and try to help them insults them so they just shut you down and proceed with what they believe is the way.
good,"Overall I’d say it’s a good place to work, it’s a great starting job or permanent job if that’s your plan. They teach life skills that will help you move on to other jobs or you have the option to stay and move up."
good,"Working at Walmart as a Stocker was alright. Management could’ve been better. I worked the third shift which meant the store was close, that made it easier to unload the pallets in stock the merchandise on the shelves"
good,Great workplace for someone who's looking for a career not just a job. Awesome benefits and terrific atmosphere of diverse cultures. Number one in customer service in retail.
good,It was a good place to work.I loved learning new things. I liked meeting new people and helping customers. I just did not get enough hours. I would recommend working there.
good,"Easy job, associates are nice. However some staff from management aren't too nice"
good,"I had a lot of fun working overnight at walmart. I had a great crew and management was awesome. We worked hard to keep out store up. Even though we would have a set time to finish a mod, we would most likely get the job done."
good,The associates I work with are nice and they do anything to possible to help you get through your shift. Their attitudes are exceptional. All of the managers work as a team.
good,Good place to work offers a lot different positions and hours applied for part time but get almost 70-80 hours a pay period work isn’t to hard some days better then others
good,The training was very detailed and hands on. The only thing I didn’t like is the amount of hours. I was classified as a full time employee but never had any hours due to all the people they hired at one time.
good,"Lugar bom para se trabalhar, com bons benefícios. Porém, infelizmente, como em qualquer outro lugar, existem algumas pessoas, que transformam o ambiente num lugar difícil e fazem as outras criarem uma imagem negativa da empresa. Por isso eu digo sempre: quem faz o ambiente da empresa, são as pessoas, preferencialmente as lideranças, que a representam. "
good,Ótima empresa para trabalhar e adquirir muita experiência.
good,I worked for Wal-Mart for almost 20 years and loved my job up until I got a new manager.  New manager made life impossible and when I needed help and went to upper management they just fired me and didn't bother listening to my open door issue.  After being their for so many years and having such a good reputation with fellow employees and management team I couldn't believe how I was treated when let go.  Was fired very unprofessional.  Felt like the truth about working for a corporate world ended up being true... after working their so many years they find anything to fire you and replace you with someone they can pay on the down side of the pay scale.
good,"Walmart has been very good to me. I started working here while I was in High school as a cart pusher, and now I have worked my way up to a department manager. It has been a good journey but I feel like I’m not fully utilizing my skills and need a new environment to fully explore what I can do."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Walmart, it taught me new skills. My coworkers were great and we were able to complete in a friendly manner. They gave us sufficient time to stock and organize the isles we worked on for the night. It’s overall a good workplace. I do feel the pay could be increased due to the job functions."
good,"It gets busy on the weekends but when it is not, it's really relaxed and you kind of just stand there and zone. you get two 15 minutes breaks when you work 6 hours or more."
good,"In 13 years I had 10 great years, In past few years the company’s direction has forced management to take short cuts to complete daily task. When you are expected to satisfy the company and the customers needs it was a pull, especially when a retirement community don’t want to check themselves out and management lets them stand in 1 line and instruct us to make them use SCO."
good,Walmart isn’t too bad of a place to work. It’s actually a good place to move up in. I’m just looking for better opportunities and a better work environment.
good,Entrei na empresa trabalhando como auxiliar de perecíveis fui promovido para auxiliar administrativo e depois gerente de loja.
good,It's a busy but a nice work place. It's a well run business that has high expectations for itself and its employees to make sure they meet the expectations and satisfy their customers and give them the best shopping experience possible. They are a great business to work for.
good,A typical day at work for me was gathering the carts and putting them inside for the costumers. I learned good costumer service skills. Management is ok. It can be because you meet a lot of people but also hard due to staying outside all day in the sun.
good,Walmart was amazing when I first started but. It’s changing and isn’t so family oriented anymore and expect open availability to schedule you whenever they want even if it’s for 5 hours
good,"Interact with customers in a friendly manner, checked out customers, helped answer any questions or concerns customers had, handled money, bagged, kept a clean work area."
good,Not a nice place to work. They do not care about their employees. The Management team is rude and not understanding at all. Benefits and pay are great.
good,"good work placw depending on managment you have  and team leads so it all depends on your team  good hours great enviorment lots of oppurtunitty"
good,Overall Walmart has been a good learning experience. You learn how to work with other associates and also customers. There are always ways to stay busy at work.
good,Great place to work if you like a fast paced environment. You meet different people daily and them you have the regular customers that come on a daily basis or several times a week!  You build relationships while you working!  It's a plus to have a great staff of people to work with you.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. The atmosphere is really laid back. They need to offer more compensation for the various jobs you do. There is no overtime and when you do you have to take it off you lunch.
good,"I am still in the proccess of learning this job so I dont think this review would count. "
good,Safe and comfortable shopping environment customer friendly respectful management and team members are cordoral to one another as well to customers but overall great place of business
good,"In a time in need it can pay the bills. It is as all places are, dramas and egos. Stand your ground on your availability but keep in mind it is retail. Holidays are necessary evils in retail."
good,"Walmart provided a nice and comfortable atmosphere to work at. On a typical day, people will have a nice attitude and work as a team to get the work done"
good,"Empresa ótima de se trabalhar  com estabilidade na função, oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"For the amount of time I was employed at Walmart, I found I really enjoyed myself. I am a people-person, so I enjoyed interacting with my peers and customers."
good,"I enjoy my job just don’t like working every sunday"
good,"Good overall job, good workers, management has favorites atleast in the store i worked at easy job to do wont get in trouble as long as you do your work"
good,It was an overall decent experience. I got promoted after only a year of being there. Very good at working with schooling. Great opportunity for college students.
good,enjoy talking to people helping them with location in store of products they can't find. Making sure all goods that are in basket are paid for. meeting new people
good,"When I worked at Walmart, every day would harbor a new adventure, some kind of change in the normality that would teach me quickly to be quick on my feet, and determined to do everything in my power to do my best."
good,I would hove to say that there is no typical day working at Walmart. Every day is new and has it own challenges. Working for Walmart will really change the way you look at everything.
good,"It's an okay job. Not a career, but it pays the bills. The store I worked at had several cliques. Hispanics in one. Smokers. It was very high school. Not very professional in my opinion."
good,"walk in and its already busy. deal with all the different kinds of customers, get a late break, help out on the registers and close down customer service and go home"
good,"Fast paced environment, where customer service is heavily required to enjoy your job duties. This company really know how to recognize, reward and celebrate their employees. Thanks so much for the training."
good,There is never a moment without something to do. Great management. The pharmacy position was by far the best for me. I learned so many things about medicines and had great support from the pharmacists and techs I worked with.
good,pues un dia normal llegas tienen junta y te dan tu cafe y pan y ya te vas y haces tu trabajo mientras te diviertes con los demas empleados
good,"The ASM role at Walmart is a tale of extremes. The easiest way to explain this is with a simple pro/con list."
good,"Providing customer service, operating the register, bagging groceries"
good,I loved working there. Workers become family. Sometimes management is rough. You get your hours there. The pay is great . You get breaks every 2 hours .
good,"My primary function is to pick, stage, and dispense grocery orders that we receive from customers thru the online channel. The job is very fast paced, which I enjoy, as the day goes by very quickly. I enjoy working at Walmart as there are other duties to attend to and you are never bored. You are always meeting new people and learning something new every day!"
good,It's my first job so I am very thankful for that. It is also transferable so when you are ready to move to a different city or even state you could take your job with you.
good,"It is a great place to work,  Department managers are ok. New store manager is great. I work in the Deli. I like it cause it is fast paced. It is a hard place to work in the store. The answer below. Do I approve of Wal-Mart CEO. I said No because I dont know him."
good,"walmart has given many opportunities to work in many different areas, while also strongly encouraging working your way up through the ranks and pushing for management. the entire team of around 300 work together very well and the management team are some of the greatest people i've ever met."
good,"I've worked for Walmart for 11 years and most my experience there hasn't been too bad, like any job it isn't perfect but it has its positive areas. I don't feel like I want to grow with the company with my current status there, just from what I've seen. I don't think every store is the same but I've heared and witnessed similarities in other stores. I could possibly just need a change of scenery but looking elsewhere is my priority now."
good,It’s a good paying job but over all the  management is not as good as they say . They make you do so much just so they won’t appreciate it at the end . there Is no over time or nothing .
good,This retail store is a good place to work if you like semi relaxed work. You have to take care of duties everyday. Its also easy for a first job. I would recommend this job.
good,"Working at Walmart was pretty good overall. Definitely good to start working there if it’s your first job. Good way to start building up you’re resume since there’s many different things you could do from forklift driving, to working with plants , to selling a flatscreen. Definitely good for the experience."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. Meeting customers and also my co-workers.  It was hard to follow some of the strict clocking in and out.  If more than 9 minutes late it was counted as half day missed.  When I got used to all of the rules and regulations, it became easy to follow t\them."
good,With the constant change in the retail industry it’s uncertain if certain positions will be around much longer. It definitely scares the long term associates that they’re pushing them out.
good,"I was fulltime for 12 years"
good,"The start of my walmart job was good, The longer i stayed the more it seems to create a terrible place to work. Either move up or move out is the way they work."
good,"Helped customers and ran and binned freight. Our overnight managers were awesome people. The hardest part of the job was the hours, 3rds is not an easy shift."
good,I worked at the neighborhood market Walmart. I started as a cashier and I loved it and worked it for a few months but standing in 1 spot can do some damage on my feet. I decided to change positions to the MOD team. That was SOOO much better. I loved it so much because your working by yourself and you get very focused. The only downside to it is that the managers expectations were a little too high. I always met them but it wasn't without trouble.
good,Walmart is a good job to get experience in the work force. It is very interesting to work there because you get to meet and interact with people from different places. The work pace there is very steady on most days and if you enjoy working you will be very productive as there is always something to do.
good,"Walmart is a great job. The work environment was very safe and protected. On a average day the pace is consistent, however it can be very busy. Everyone is given the opportunity to grow."
good,"I honestly don’t have too much to say, it was a part time job that I wouldn’t mind being full-time, but they couldn’t offer me the hours, and there were better paying jobs elsewhere so I decided to work somewhere else."
good,"The job in itself was something I enjoyed mostly. As a graveyard shift, there were little to no customers and I was able to more focus on my responsibilities as a stocker. The only real issues were the other employees and the hours. There was very much clique culture going on and it was hard to establish any friendships. The hours was something I was very aware of going in, but I did not fully realize the effect it would have on my social life. Taught me a valuable lesson. I did like the management though, they were very helpful and willing to listen. Though they were consistently on the move and this made tracking them hard."
good,I enjoyed my time there work is easy with plenty of movement within the company. If your good with people this job is cake and you get bonuses once or twice a year.
good,Low pay with difficult conditions and over working managers. Lacked leadership and job site was often filled with lazy employees. Terrible customer service and lack of care over all.
good,Walmart offers anyone the opportunity to learn the business of retail.  It is challenging and demanding if you want to be successful in terms of both compensation and advancement.
good,"First time worked there, missed lot of time because of kid on the way, given choice to quit or get fired.  Second go around, had bad time keeping up with changes to schedule, fired.  Not very understanding for most part in regards to having to miss for family."
good,"Customer service "
good,"Wasn’t a bad job but also wasn’t the best. Pretty good management and job culture. Nothing really bad to say about the job, Enjoyed the special cleaning assignments."
good,"Atypical day at my job starts at 4:00am and ends at 1:00pm.We come in and wait for the truck to come once it does we unpack the truck, down stack the pallets and move the live freight onto our carts. We run the live freight til it is gone then we break off into different departments to run the picks/ over stock. In this short time period at Walmart I've learned how to cap bins and make picks, I have learned how to mark overstock and depose of unfresh produce so that it doesn't cause shrink in our store. The management at Walmart is very poor, they are very un-motivated and over all not concerned about their employees. The hardest part of my job is having to get up so early to go into work, and getting hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is that for the most part I can move at my own pace."
good,I have learn how to work in environment that can be a challenge sometime. Walmart has good benefits an hour lunch is nice and two 15 minute breaks.I met some nice people.
good,Working for Walmart and shopping in Walmart are totally different. The pay was really terrible at the time. It has gotten better throughout time. Associates opinions matter as well.
good,I was a cart pusher there so i didn't gt to do much except walk around and gathers cart. The manager was helpful and willing tyo help with everything i need.
good,I always had a good time with whoever I worked with and was able to work at my own pace and interact with customers in a productive manner and enjoy my job
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, worked with friends and had a very understanding boss. Unloading and loading trucks was hard but enjoyed the workout. Hours were always there to, only problem i ever had was with employees for other parts of the store, they would try to tell me what to do even thought they worked in a completely different section of the store and i was completing my own tasks."
good,Walmart is a fast pace work environment. You have to be people friendly. Walmart is a very hands on environment. You have to be a team player. You can learn a lot from working in that type of environment.
good,Not really for  Long term but a good start they do provide benefits and they work with u if u in school show up on time and do your job you will be fine
good,The company was nice to work for but hard to follow chain of command when problems arise. Overall friendly coworkers and had some very good managers willing to help
good,"When working at Walmart you have two decisions. You can either stand your ground with your job position or be open to work wherever they ask you to. When I worked at Walmart, I was hired as a cashier but from time to time I was asked to do a job I didn't know how to do. The managers at Walmart were very supportive and were willing to help you if you were willing to help them in return."
good,i got in to start work at ten p.m. and worked opening boxes and shelving product till seven a.m. the next day. got a break every two hours and an unpaid lunch hour.
good,Walmart is good friendly place of work. It will help you exceed & help with education. Most of the time it is kept clean friendly with customers. I would recommend working at Walmart.
good,I enjoyed the fast pace environment.  I love the store discount and stock options. The hours available and amount of hours are inconsistent. Enjoyed keeping busy and learning about customer service.
good,"Most employees don’t stay long but if you do they give you plenty of chances to move up, fast paced we’re pretty good about giving days off requested as long as you gave a good amount of prior notice  to the schedule being made"
good,"Able to meet new people"
good,"It is a good company to work for and you can retire with Walmart, But your hours differ every day, one day you may work 7 AM to 4 PM the next day 2 PM to 11 PM then back again at 10 AM to 7 PM. With the scheduling it’s very hard to have a life outside Walmart and you hardly ever see your family,"
good,"Have open hours and live close and be able to work more then 8 hours, it’s a very fast paced work environment, be able to do your role plus more and be able to lift 25 pounds"
good,The walmart I worked at had poor management. But it was still fun. I did learn more than what I had already knew. Some managers deserved raises and others deserved to be fired. I didn't like how some managers treated the front end like slaves.
good,Walmart has helped me build upon myself and has provided me the oppurtunity to move up and be sucessful. Walmart has even provided me with ideas on where i want to go with my career while building skills necessary to get where i want to be.
good,Walmart was a good place to work they didn't run the air conditioner and did not listen to the employees so well they would change schedules without asking.
good,"Walmart is not the most glamorous job out there but pay tends to be pretty decent considering the hiring requirements are minimal. Benefits are decent considering the ease of getting a job and are fairly comprehensive along with very flexible scheduling. The issues that come from working for Walmart is that the situations you end up in can vary significantly based on the individual store. The ones that have fairly set longer term staff and are not overly busy and understaffed can be great. After those stores it can be a slippery slope. Most Walmarts have a lot of turnover and managers are consisently moved around making consistency a bit difficult to find. Overall, if you find a decently consistent store without a lot of turnover you could do much worse, but if that is not the case you should probably stay away."
good,"Their are many changes taking place at walmart, things aren't how it used to be. Walmart employees no longer get holiday pay, not a a lot of hours a given, some managers lack professionalism."
good,This job is descent for the short term but you'll need to advance if you want to make any real money within this company benefits are good stocks are descent and they have a 401k
good,Overall it was a good job. I learned to drive a lift pretty early on and the training was offered by walmart. They could improve on rotation as they tend to keep the same people at one position when they should be rotating employees. Good people to work with. Enough hours eventhough I was considered part time. They have their slow seasons but overall you can still get 40 hours/week.
good,"Walmart is a very friendly type work environment they expect for you to do your job and do it well..if you just do your job they wont bother you as much, yea i have had in the pass managers that were just so annoying but the new managers are pretty ok. and policy's also change as well meaning you can wear whatever cloths you want now, which is a plus and i did hear the minimum wages have change as well but as for the rest of the centers policy's, its pretty balance ..if you looking for a job where you love interacting with customers and putting a friendly smile on them and impressing your coworkers and managers by being a team player then that's the job for you."
good,It's a job. The people are what you make of it. Dealing with the public is always going to be a hit or miss. Just have to learn how to let some things roll off of you. Same for coworkers and/or bosses/management.
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you have a good work ethic. The hours and work is demanding but the pay is respectable regarding the work. The management is like any other management. They expect you to do the job that you were hired to do.
good,Love working with the people I work with just wish there was a easier way to advance in the company and there was better pay and cheaper and year round sign up for health coverage
good,Learn a lot but work life balance is not good. You will work 11+ hours per day and will be stressed out. Especially if it’s during inventory or the holidays.
good,I'm cap 1 so it's very fast paced and we have to cap all the grocery bins and work all the groceries to the floor. We have to make sure its all done before weave at 1pm.
good,"Walmart pays well , has lots of work helping Customers and stocking . Walmart management , in most cases , is good and helpful.The benefits at Walmart are good ,,especially if working long time."
good,Management team need to learn how to communicate direct with each other and maybe the process will run smoothly. Learn to listen to your employees sometimes before you assume you know how when you never been in that position to lead that group properly. I love to train and set my employees up for success. When my employees is on process I felt great for that. Walmart is an awesome place to work when people is placed in the position that fits them.
good,"This company and I have been through alot, I'm not looking to leave all together, I just want a change. There are alot of changes happening and I would rather have a more consistent schedule."
good,"My average day was fairly straightforward, but there was enough variation in tasks to keep it interesting. Coworkers were friendly and helpful, the management did not interfere in my duties and largely left me alone. I personally most enjoyed unloading the produce shipment even though it meant coming in at 5 AM, it was good exercise and improved my organizational skills."
good,This would have been a greatvm company if they had the right management and team members. Some stores have a great team but done dont really car how there store looks.  I was hired to deep clean. I was a horrible sight. I got penalized for others mishaps. The management was upset because i head an asthma attack due to their mismanagement of a different shifts laziness.
good,Walmart is a good place to work but it can be very stressful at times. When you are a manager it can be extremely difficult to get people onboard with the plan and the accountability process takes time.
good,"I enjoy working at walmart and I would recommend it to anyone. I learned a lot of team work, and structure. I am just looking for more pay and something challenging."
good,I worked as an unloader and forklift operator in staple stock. This was a very strenuous and hard job. Alot of heavy lifting and at a fast paced. You are timed for unloaded a whole tractor trailer by yourself.
good,working for Walmart was fun and productive got to meet great new people. Made some good friends that worked there. The management was on point they cared for the workers well being and how they were doing.
good,Never in a millon years thought id like wallmart .once i got there started as toy department. Stocker then after 5 months went to maintaince got certified with fork lift scissor lift got alot of freedom minamal supervision
good,"Okay place to work, needs help in work and family time. Need to keeps days off together. Not really a fair way to advance. But over all it's not a bad starter company."
good,"In this company he works hard every day. There is always merchandise to be placed. They work pallets, it depends on how many you bring in a truck. and worked from two to 4 pallets. If the merchandise is over stock you have to put a labol and place it in its place. It's hard to work here. I learned everything. Epodido work in all departments. What I liked the most is making the Modulares of the store. and more the ones of sesonal. The contra is the bad organization that has the company with associates and pay."
good,Had a good work experience and very nice co-worker that are always willing to help. They always have a problem with scheduling but they are very helpful on fixing them
good,First 10 days of the month extremely busy. Requires you to manage conflict well and be able to problem solve. Must be a team player. The hardest part of the job is that it is hard work being on your feet for multiple number of hours. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to help customers. I learned how to work remain calm and handle stressful situations in a professional manner.
good,The team at Walmart is very helpful and is willing to help anybody at any moment which motivated me to work harder. Very enjoyable for the most part. :)
good,"Management is pretty good, job is good has its ups and downs. Hours for full time associates are descent. Earnings are good. You have to earn the PTO. But you don't get much of it."
good,Put freight to shelf make sure the store was clean ready for business open at 6 am. Walmart was good company work for but the manager team suck. I took higher pay postion
good,You want to work then this job is for you. If you don't like fast pace and heat or cold this is not the job for you. Management is far and between to find when you need help. So asking your neighboring coworker is at your own risk
good,hardest part of my job was organizing and unloading pallets to organizer certain products onto specific carts to make stocking more easy and efficient
good,"It was very laid back. As long as you did your job, you could work at your own pace, breaks were fair and frequent, not at all stressful. Management was always willing to work with you."
good,"There is almost always parking"
good,"If you like to learn on hands then Walmart is the place to go. However it is not a place to relax, or give up. "
good,"Aprendí a trabajar en todas las áreas de recursos humanos, a trabajar bajo políticas y procedimientos, a tomar decisiones que ayuden a sumar al departamento y a la empresa. "
good,"Good job but has bad Attendance policy, you can be fired even if you call in. Also work days are real long, but the do give you PTO, and Discounts. You can also own a piece of the Company with Stock options"
good,"Empresa ótima, porém no cargo de Vendedor onde vendíamos milhões por mês aos comerciantes do varejo, total desvalorização."
good,"The job is ok, there are some good things and bad. Overall its a good job if you are in college. The job has worked well with my school schedule as well, so thats a plus."
good,"people friendly environment "
good,Very friendly people to work with and family oriented. Understanding with situations of life and work with you. Lots of resources for education continuation!
good,Was a great place to adjust and start to work  in a environment filled with a team of people. Had room and opportunities to learn more. But the leadership did not provide proper training to succeed for new employees.
good,"Good paying job with plenty of hours available, only downside is that even if your late because of traffic or some other unavoidable incident they dont accept it."
good,"Walmart created a work environment for me, a high schooler at the time, in which I was able to essentially learn about ""work"". It taught me patience, diligence, and accountability through many long days, rushes, and even slow days with no rushes."
good,Walmart is a very competitive job. But it is also very relaxed and laid back. It had help me learn more customer service and how to engage in helping a customer to fulfill his/her needs.
good,I worked at walmart for 5 years on overnight. I enjoyed my coworkers and some of the management staff. Moving up in the company was hard when I worked there because they did not teach people how to do managers job or the duties they had to take care of. From my understanding that has changed and now they have a program that changes that. As for the work enviroment it was difficult but manageable. And the managers were quite reasonable and fair and understanding.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for i’ve been there 5 years and have had many great experiences l’ve learned a lot they just need to work on their communication
good,"I have no complaints in regards to my time at Walmart. During my time there, which was cut short due to personal reasons, I experienced a comfortable and uplifting environment, helpful and friendly employees. Understanding management, made my exit feel so stress free during a difficult time. The location I had the opportunity to work at was such a wonderful introduction to healthy workforce though it wasn't my first job."
good,I learned a lot about stocking and how the store runs. Co-workers were pretty nice. Normally when I'm working the store is pretty busy. Overall the job responsibilities were straight forward.
good,The rules change way to frequently. During the couple of months I was in fresh cap the rules on our cvp process changed four times. I understand that you need to adapt to succeed but too much change can also be a detriment.
good,"CSR was one of the most important roles you greet and thank everyone, it was a fast paced enviorment which i loved personally. open and close transactions"
good,"Working at Walmart will provide you with many skills. You get to formally help people, you get to learn about many life skills and also learn how to be formal."
good,Good place to work great pay overtime always managers r all great people very helpful n understanding of certain situations...the work is very demanding but awarding with the pay the work environment is great good benefits n insurance policy for the whole family...
good,Me gustaba mucho trabajar pero aveces eran medio pesados
good,easy fast and relaxing. management was good i lover working with them. finishing everything by the end of the night. most enjoyable part was crushing the boxes after done putting the items away
good,The company is pretty good to work for. Management can be alittle uneasy to work with. You must be able to Multitask and be willing to help others in a uick manner.
good,"Very comfortable work space , enjoyed trmhe discounts and meeting new people , able to multitask and get everything done in time, coworkers were also very helpful."
good,"Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar como Jovem Aprendiz no departamento pessoal, onde possui varias experiências como meu primeiro emprego, tenho muito agradecer por todo conhecimento que possui."
good,I enjoyed my job as a cashier at Walmart. I enjoyed interacting with most customers and I made many great friends while working there. I learned different ways to handle customers that were unhappy or happy and overall enhanced my people skills. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place for an entire 8 hour shift. I was hard on your feet. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 10 percent discount on anything you buy from the store.
good,"Wal-Mart was a good first job, and I would work there again. During my time there I made a few casual friends, honed my work ethic, and made enough money to take the load off my parent's for a little."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you are in need of work right away but find something better fast, Not a great place work hard for small pay no good benefits  just a dead end job."
good,"Most days were pretty good, and when I started having troubles with my depression, they worked with me. I only really liked one of the supervisors, didn't really know the managers. I really liked working on cap team two (before everyone started dropping like flies) and cashiering. On cap team two, we all worked together to get the job done. I also liked how both jobs made me busy and there wasn't a lot of time off. What I didn't like was that there was a time limit on the cap team two job and I often couldn't do what needed to be done in time."
good,"walmart is ok depending on the store and the management, going to work is by far the hardest part of any job at walmart. Walmart will have overtime during winter, if you are in any sort of management you will have no life."
good,"The days are long at work, but it goes by fast, because you are always busy at work. The managers were very nice and they worked well with my hours and school."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. I was offered several career advancements starting as a Temp in the Electronics department. After having my son I returned and was offered a promotion to a customer service manager. After about a year I was offered a position as a GM support manager and was able to learn the whole floor.
good,"Flexibilidad en horario, enfocado a llegar al forecast. Interés por lllevar a cabo convivencias grupales por unidad de negocio."
good,Management in most Walmarts are good but always put too much work on your plate. Delegating is primary key to not being over worked if you have the staff in your area. Management usually changes after every inventory in all stores. Technology is also advancing inside the stores as well so an adjustment to change is a must
good,At the time I gracefully resigned I had watched 50 people unrightfully terminated... I loved the customer servicing and really enjoyed the job overall... However the seemingly corrupt salaried employees made it impossible! They all are gone from company now. I am fully rehirable and would work for walmart again!!
good,uma empresa de grande porte muito boa de trabalha paga todo mês certo mais o salario e pouco
good,"The job is determined based off of you, if you show yourself and work hard for the job, they will notice you. and advance you, if you chill with the bare minimum they notice that too, but don't expect advancement , if you slack off, they don't really say anything. you just aren't known. the job was extremely easy, the hours are great , if they are being fed, they feed you. the company is a great place to work at. i ended on good terms and would go back, but i'm not looking to work in that field anymore. the Most enjoyable part of working with Walmart is the team work the store manager gives."
good,"Each day is a different experience depending on the customers and specific challenges you have to deal with. They are not all the same however, it does feel nice when a customer is appreciative of the work that was done for them or from the satisfaction they received from a particular item purchased on that day."
good,"I really don't have much to say about working for Wal-Mart. If you do your job you'll have no problems. No job is too tough, but just depends what department you work and who your supervisor is."
good,"If you put in the time and effort and show you can and are willing to work, you will be able to advance in this company. This is an ok company to work for, but politics sometimes plays a role and how well liked you are with management."
good,"Wal-Mart is and always was an awesome place to work until I was introduced into an department management role and abused verbally and physically through the impossible tasks implemented on a daily basis. In retail there is always room for improvement but to this employer there is only time for improvement and his ideals towards production goals became unreasonable and most times crazy. Our store manager would push 3 people's work load on me aswell as the work I already had while giving me no help and then repremanding me when i was unable to finnish. I was later fired from this job because I had to take 3 days off due to an illness I had no controle over. I followed all the rules and provided all the appropriate doctors information/ excused from work notices, but was denied leave coverage after the fact for only taking off work for a 3 day period instead of 4. This forced me to acceded my amount of points thus resulting in termination. Note that in order to have an acceptable leave of action you must take more than 3 days off. This information is not provided to employees."
good,It was a good stepping stone job to get ready for a career. Pretty stable with descent management and some very hard working individuals. Overall descent.
good,"Working for Walmart requires you to always be on your feet, being able to get the tasks you are assigned to done a soon as possible. Walmart does pay you fairly depending on what your current financial status is. However, getting a promotion is quite a hassle, especially you've been working to the bone to prove your worth and being told you will be promoted soon, which ends up never happening. But overall it's a decent start to those new to the work field."
good,Working for Wal-Mart has been a great means to receive job experience and start off in the workforce. I personally enjoy my position and love the Loss Prevention side of the company.
good,Walmart has a very diverse culture that encourages growth while challenging the individual to strive for excellence.
good,My section manager made things easier for me and made sure I had the hep that I needed. The hardest part of the job was to work when coming off of surgery and telling them that I have medical restrictions and them not standing up to that.
good,"walmart was a very friendly work environment where i could always go into work with a smile and a high-five from the door greeters. the only downsides were that the scheduling is terrible there, you have to give a three weeks notice on what days you need off and it's rare to actually get them off"
good,"There are a lot of good and bad things with every job but to know if a job can sustain an average life in this day and age is a blessing. Sustaining a home, having pto, being able to spend time with friends and family are by far the things a job needs to offer by default and Wal-Mart did just that. You can easily separate life and work unlike most jobs where you get called in last minute."
good,"I started for Wal-Mart as an hourly associate in the deli. I never worked for retail company before and I did not imagine ever having a career with Wal-Mart.   In 2004 the culture and Managment teams were amazing and lived by Sam Walton teachings. My managers made me believe I could be somebody and have a great career.  The last promotion in my career was to a co manager position. That was only 2 years after I had started in the deli.  I went from making $8 an hour as a deli associate to making $60,000 as a shift manager.  Wal-Mart taught me how to be a leader.  Paid me extremely well and they have great benefits. I have worked all over the West coast and Wal-Mart paid for every relocation. I loved Wal-Mart.   What soured my opinion of Wal-Mart is eventually the belief in the culture of Wal-Mart I experienced wasn't as important as it used to be.  The old school Managment teams were retiring i don't know. But the culture soured.  I found this out the hard when I was injured on the job.  I had worked, lived, and breathed for Wal-Mart over 10 years and I was injured unloading a truck.  I miss the use of my arm for 3 months.   And I just couldn't be the same work till i drop manager and unfortunately I was forced to step down as a manager. All those years of blood sweat and tears I felt were for nothing.  Cause as soon as I couldn't physically do it I was basically forced out. Nothing really mattered anymore but stocking times and customer lines.  Wal-Mart provided me with the tools to succeed and I am forever grateful. Just don't get hurt there. Also upper Managment has no stability"
good,"Lots of advancement opportunities, rewards for hard workers, and you are paid pretty well. You also get discounts and paid time off. All in all, a great place to work."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work because there was always something to do and the hours went by fast. Depending on the store, the management team can be a good team and willing to work with you and your needs as well as keeping things under control. There was always room to improve and advance within the company. Everyone worked well with others and Walmart work with peoples needs and cultures. Walmart now only provides part time work so if looking for full-time, this is not one to work for. One thing that I hated  was that if I wanted to move from one department in the store to another, there was the possibility that I would loose wages per hour and possible hours. I enjoyed working with everyone including the managers. Unfortunately, the store I was at was a manager training store and there were times that some of the managers that come in didn't care about other needs only that we did what we were told. There was a low morale at times."
good,"It's a good place to work, co-workers are just like any other place, some good and some always in your business. "
good,A very fast pace job. always moving constantly busy. good atmosphere. Team driven work environment. good work hours sometimes stressful. very friendly
good,"It can be easy to become upset working at Walmart, especially if your manager isn't compassionate or understanding which I've seen quite a bit in other departments. Biggest problems are either scheduling and/or staffing. I've seen an entire department have three or four workers total. A lot of the time they only had one person scheduled for the day. If you plan on applying be mindful of which department you join. And maybe more important than that, it's Walmart, expect some rude customers and people that...aren't the brightest."
good,"It is a nice place to work, they need to accept dr. excuses and if you cannot work certaian days should not hold that against hours per week..My automotive manager is good if you need request days off he woukd give it to you."
good,"Loved the job but had to leave due to other things involving school and family, and started working volunteer work. They were very customer service oriented and we're friendly. Great job I ever had."
good,i operated the cash register and assisted the customers with their purchases. I kept my area clean at all times and kept the walmart bags stocked. I love interacting with people.
good,shock shelves rotate items by expiration date. I have learned how to be more of a people person. management is very good to there employees. the only real hard part nothing. very friendly work place
good,I have no comments. Each person has to create their own opinion based on their experience and have their own criteria. the company every day has many changes where you do not finish learning since all days change.
good,There are lots of tasks to do and sometimes not enough people to help out. But when there is coverage everything ends up going smoothly with little to no issues. Everyone has a part to do so as long as if they carry their own weight then the job becomes easier.
good,This is a good opportunity to learn new skills and for experience. They have different kinds of help for their associates like if you want to go back to school they help you get your business degree. They also help you if you are in a financial hardship.
good,Good company.  Bad upper management  at this particular site.  I absolutely adored my previous manager.  He was the person that had given me the opportunity to grow.
good,"Good environment, great work/life balance, but toxic management. Ego's all around and psychotic grudgy coworkers. good if you're working a job and going to school though..."
good,an okay job to work at and it wasn't that bad unless management sucked that day. overall it was a nice job to have wile you are still in college because they can help you with school
good,I've been there 13 yrs cutting hours is why I need to find something more they are a competitive company that is looking to develope in many areas and has been fair to me just cant take the hr cuts over all been a good work environment
good,definitley a fast paced environment filled with daily tasks that are required to be met at the end of the day. there is always room for improvement and to move up in management .
good,When I first started walking at Walmart the staff welcomed me with open arms. I was trained for a week and that’s when I started doing things on my own I really liked stocking but some days it will get tough because of the customers and the trucks will not end up showing up.
good,Walmart is a great place for a person how likes interacting and providing great customer service to the consumer .Also you learn how to work under pressure with other people..
good,I enjoyed the work and making friends with the employees and also learning different methods of work and the work environment the hours are great and helpful
good,Walmart allowed me to make very beneficial connections and taught me valuable skills that will allow me to advance further in my personal and proffesional life.
good,"Walmart was a friendly, exciting place to work. You get to meet lots of new people everyday, mostly good, occasionally bad experiences. Job requirements were not that strenuous or stressful, pretty basic for an entry level store associate. At the time i worked for Walmart hourly rate was determined differently for each person, but in a general it was not very competitive. The benefits were decent, and the bonuses were ok as well. If you are a workaholic, Walmart does not hardly ever offer over time, the hours i was scheduled to work put me between 32-37 hours a week usually working 5 days a week. Some days i was only scheduled to work 5-6 hours, and rarely ever do you have weekends off. Customer service is key at Walmart. So being a people person is a must if you want to work here."
good,Walmart is a good company overall but when someone who is supervising you does not get along with or like your ideas they can somewhat impede your upward progress.
good,Otima empresa boa de trabalhar mais algumas coisas. Nao dão. Certo
good,Overall good job I would say but still had its down fall with management . Somedays where better then others just get in where you fit in stay outta of trouble ...
good,"great coworker "
good,"A typical day for me at work is completing my work task which usually involves a lot of heavy lifting. Dealing with customer needs."
good,"Fun job to do, not a lot of employees on my Walmart. Most of the time only 2 people closing the deli. Managers are always complaining when they don’t have associates to help in the production."
good,"I had a good work experience at Walmart, the only constraint was less working hours due to the number of employees at that location. I have experience is sales, Bakery and Fashion."
good,It was a very productive and contently  working job. The management there is no good. I did learn on how to work a cashier. The only enjoyable part of the job is some of the customers
good,"Most enjoyable was the people I work with.typical day was long"
good,Working for Walmart isn’t as bad as everyone thinks it is. The company works for you and seeks your best interest. They offer training for all depts if willing. They help you move up in the company if you have interest in earning a higher position.
good,When I was working at Walmart I was a cashier I would start my day off by clocking in then going to the front and get on the register and begin my day greeting the customers an scanning they grocery’s
good,"Convenient location, most coworkers are seem nice however when asked for help as an employee or a customer a lot of time it takes a long time to get what you need. staffing is usually really low not sure why that is."
good,"Fast paced, fun, and friendly place to work.Opportunity for advancement, would love the opportunity to work for Walmart again, attendance was an issue before, it will not be an issue this time,as have moved closer to work"
good,"If you enjoy retail this is the place for you! If you need a job with flexibility this is a good place to work. Also, a great startup job! It's a good company to work for!"
good,"It's not a fantastic company to work for but it is not the worst, though this was years and years ago, I really enjoyed the people I worked with, but a lot of the time the assistant managers didn't seem to know what they were doing."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart . They worked with my availability well. I would recommend working there to anyone. My availability had to change while working there. I had no problem getting them to work with me. Management and CSMs were great to work with. I had to leave because of my back.
good,Work was simple. Started off in overnight produce stocking. Then moved to stocking in frozen. My final position was IMS. All I had to do was count and tag inventory. Good atmosphere and employees. Everyone worked as a team.
good,un excelente aria de trabajo para persona q labora
good,Walmart is very much a place that you get what you put in. You can move up in store if you work hard and apply yourself to your work.  It is still retail so it requires a large part of your life.
good,The workplace was fun and I learned many different skills - especially how to deal with people. I appreciated what I learnt at this establishment and is a fantastic first job.
good,"my time at walmart was an acceptable work place. fair hours, good people, and good pay. they offer flexible hours and will work with any kind of schedule you have."
good,"Empresa Boa em crescimento profissional.Disposta a ajudar seus colaboradores, refeição apropriada, IPI fornecido de acordo com a setor.trasporte quando já não tem como ir embora e fornecido. Empresa de Boa qualidade."
good,"Im overall experience was great! The experience and knowledge i gained working for walmart is unmatched. Of course there are things and people I didn't like and didn't agree with, but what job doesn't? In terms of Walmart your experience will be different as an employee depending on the position you apply for, the location of the store, and who YOU are as a person. I have visited many stores and every store is different the employee connection within the store. Walmart is way more than a store that sells goods and services they are so much more. "
good,meeting new employees and showing them around Walmart. I also like helping customers find items that they can not find. I also love the atmosphere that I am in as well
good,"A typical day would normally start with trying to do everything that the previous shift failed to complete while also weaving in one's own tasks for the day. The management above you is either kind or apathetic. The hardest part of the job is trying to please your customers and associates when they need your assistance and failing. For no matter how hard you try, there will always be a rude, hateful person who will twist your words and intentions. The most enjoyable part is actually hearing a thank-you from someone who needed your help, regardless of the outcome."
good,Walmart  will teach you to work on getting goals completed. The training is slim to none done by computer classes. A few years back there were opportunities to do more with the company but now everything is structured.
good,"A typical day was very fast paced. Which I loved, it made the day fly by! I learned how to work quickly efficiently under a fast pace. I loved working with the customers and getting to know the regulars."
good,Easy job for the $. This job is what you make it. There is always opportunity to move up. If you have a positive attitude and do your job you'll love it. If you think this is just a job then it's just a job. Be mindful of the managers who have there favorites those do exist in ever store. Over all know that the customer really does come first and learn to balance that with your day to day task.
good,Management do not allow employees to talk to each other. which makes it more stressful and difficult to work. Low pay and overworked but never satisfied.
good,Good place to work. Amazing crew! Fast paced. Every understanding. And quit. I was working overnight! But it did feel amazing helping others when it’s not even in my department
good,"overall Walmart is a decent place to work.  They have several shifts to choose from, insurance and other benefits for employees, hours are mainly flexible, and you can get discount on items in store, and you get hour break and 2 smaller breaks.    I felt like environment was more on relaxed side of thing which was nice."
good,"Walmart is a competitive workplace  with many opportunities for advancement. Great benefits including but not limited to medical, dental, vision coverage and paid time off.  Flexible work  hours with high demand for evening shifts."
good,The only thing I didn’t like about this job is that only a handful of my teammates seemed to take the job seriously. Management will get pretty desperate and keep on lazy employees just to have warm bodies on the floor. There was always a constant battle between morning and day crew accusing each other of not doing their job correctly. The pay  and the hours were good though.
good,"Pour une personne qui apprécie travailler au contact de la clientèle, j'ai aimée travaillée lorsque nous avions des belles journées. Cependant, il y avait parfois des problèmes avec les pauses lors d'achalandage et cela devenait malsain pour la santé et nous n'avions pas le droit à des bouteille d'eau. Il y avait également un problème lors des horaires car ceux-ci ne respectait point nos demandes selon les heures auxquelles nous pouvions travailler malgré leur approbation au préalable."
good,"You can really do any job at Walmart really, management can be a pain sometimes but for the most part if your coming straight out of high school Walmart is great with working with your schedule."
good,Very customer based business. Always a busy and fast paced working environment. Strict but fair policy for almost every possible situation. Helpful managers (in most cases) are willing to assist their crew in times of need.
good,The possibilities are endless when it comes to working with Walmart. The sky is the limit. They have a job for any and everybody and are willing to work with you to find the best fit for each individual.
good,its good company for every employee working environment is good take to knowledge for future we have done good job in wal-mart our collieg  are very friendly nature
good,"Job consists of standing for 2 to 4 hours at a time, cashing out customers. It's a nice job if you want something part time and want experience working with the public."
good,"People were genuinely friendly and helpful.  You got the help you needed when you asked for it.  They wanted us to work hard, but in an encouraging not forceful way."
good,management was trash..very rude and never solved issues. Pay was decent if you are accustomed to min wage..............................................
good,It's Walmart. You either like it or you didn't. Management usually was middle of the road. They typically would help you then throw you under the bus.
good,"The store I work at has wonderful coworkers and managers. Working as a part time cashier is a great opportunity to meet new and exciting people especially if you are a people person, The job itself is easy but is physically demanding due to standing on concrete floors all day."
good,"My typical day at work would start off at a run, and some times not slow down. I learned to have patience with people to understand their problems, and find the solutions to fix them. Management like in all places had its good and bad, but the good often out weighed the bad. It also had a good open door policy if you needed.to use it. Workplace culture was definitely based on sales but also advancing the employee, and helping them and the community. The hardest part of the job was often dealing with the often belligerent, and rude customers. that wanted what they wanted despite what policy said. The most enjoyable part of the job was the good coworkers and friends I made, helping the truly grateful customers and brighting their day."
good,it had its up's and down's working at Walmart my co-works was cool and helpful at times In the begin the management good but over time they started to go down hill in they're management skills.
good,"After moving, I was constantly sick in the new area, I didn’t get to stay as long as I wished to be. As a newcomer, you can miss 4 days until the 6th month of working there. Unfortunately for me, I missed an extra day that I could due to a horrible stomach bug. I can only hope my horrible attendance at this job doesn’t end up representing me as a worker since I normally would come in no matter what was wrong with me. Nearly every day I was in for work, I was sick with something. I only missed the days I physically was not able to come in. If I could’ve had 5-6 days off before termination, then I would have been okay. I most likely wouldn’t have missed another day for years."
good,"Overnight stocking was amazing. Nice and easy except when it came down to the wire, got a long great with management and coworkers. The nights could sometimes be slow, but that wasnt a problem for me."
good,Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar.e para aprender novas funções.
good,"It was a fast paced environment where there was always something that needed to be done. The hardest part of the job was when other departments fell behind then another had to be the one to pick up the slack, putting everyone further behind schedule."
good,"The job was pretty dull most of the time, everyday was pretty much the same, unload a truck, stock the shelves, throw carboard in the bailer. The hour lunch was cool but that ended up causing me to be there for an hour longer, leading to less time outside of work."
good,"Its Walmart someday are good some days are bad and some are okay, same goes for management and coworkers. It's a mix of everything holidays and weekends are busy unless you work day shift where it can be easier."
good,"Depending on your store, it isn't a bad place to work especially for people in school such as college. You have the ability to and are encouraged to strive for promotions. Corporate red tape makes things very difficult a lot of times however and the process and procedures you adhere to changes literally monthly."
good,"Overall it was a good experience, management wasn’t very helpful at all times. The employees that have been there longer were rude and wanted to be bossy."
good,My overnight work experience at Wal-Mart has been a very good one. There are fewer associates on the evening shift which cuts down on personality conflicts that seem to happen more frequently during the day when there are more employees working.
good,I had a good experiance with walmart. Maybe because of the stores i was at and was in tle. Customers can be a pain but that is walmart. Great coworkers and good management. If you showed good work you moved up.
good,Was not a bad place to work I liked having the ability to work/life balance since I have kids in school and sports. Employees were great to work with.
good,"All of the employees as Walmart deserve better than they receive.  Management expects too much out of too little. Not enough people scheduled to cover all areas, especially if a person calls in."
good,Other employees need to be nice to each other is my main complaint. Management was very good. They were kind and caring about their employees while at the same time not taking BS.
good,The store manager was awesome and most of the  management team was awesome loved the people I worked with. The only problem was my Is wrecked assistant manager would only help one area and that was it she wouldn’t come help in any other department but all in all it was a awesome place to work
good,"This company is for you if you are willing to work your life around the schedules they give you. That is really the only drawback. You are pretty much married to your work and family comes second, even though they always say that family comes first. You never know what will happen from one day to the next and always wonder a out job security. They are known for getting rid of long time associates and management to try to save money."
good,they didn’t do too well on training associates. I also had trouble with my schedule a few times. You weren’t just entitled to one job. They expected you to manage others.
good,"El trabajo bien, pero hay muchas preferencias y de esa manera es difícil trabajar por las injusticias"
good,"Very structured daily routine that was expected to occur each day that provided me the ability to lead others and feel supported by the company. Provided the tools necessary to do the job both at the district level along with company support that answered concerns quickly."
good,"At first I enjoyed it.  I stayed busy but other employees didn't like it, made them look bad. After that I didn't care much for the job, not a lot of advancement"
good,ppl was nice enough but really competative some managers wanted more from people they are not over then the people they are directly over and assume you will work over whenever they say
good,Working there was okay I was able to get hours as I need it able to change my schedule to an easier one to match my schedule good supervising employees
good,It was a great job work for Walmart almost five years I can say I liked the people I worked with and the people that came to shop as well never had a bad time
good,Interesting and fast paced.  Meeting a multitude of people in the position  I held.  Management is dedicated and willing to help in any compacity they can .
good,"One of the things I like best is that Walmart works around my school schedule. But as a cashier, most of my time is spent one-on-one with the customers. The only team collaboration I get is calling a manager over for help every now and then."
good,"Working for Walmart was not a bad experience, yet there were some ups and downs about the job. The management is not all that great and hours can vary from week to week."
good,"The company is changing a lot right now. Some good changes, some not so good. Some of the changes are making long term associates have to decide whether to change positions and possibly step down or else leave the company."
good,It’s a lot of fun workin for Walmart during the holiday time we have certain days were we get the dress up. Walmart also will cook for us different meals
good,There are a lot of positions you can learn about and move up. You just have to have the patience. They didn't mind you going up the ladder if had problems that someone didn't or wouldn't fix
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Walmart is working with so many diverse people that are focus on one goal of taking care of customers.  People make the the difference.
good,"It was simple and good excercising at first, but can be really stressful and too much days to work, especially during the summer when it’s hot outside and [I’m] dying a thirst. Now those hours were short, balanced and flexible."
good,"Was a good experience a first look into a corporate setting, management had a little to be desired but overall I enjoyed the work that I did The pay was good and the job security was outstanding."
good,"The manager who conducted the interview was very good in providing information needed. Also very cordial, and low key. Found some common ground in personality."
good,Great job for anyone just starting off in their work career path in life. I enjoyed my time at this job and even though it is hard working it is not a job that over does a person.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of getting to work early and finding your equipment. Then you get your things you need such as your coat, beanie, gloves etc. Then you have to log on to your head set and see what area you'll start to work from. Once you find a lift and your logged into your head set, now you can begin work. Then we stretch and begin to work on hand picking cases and remember that every trip is timed. Your are required to average or  make production of 100% every week and is not able to make it weekly you can get a write up."
good,En étant manutentionnaire le fait que l'on travail physique est bon pour la santé mais aussi comporte son lot de désagrément. J'ai travaillé 11 ans pour eux et par la suite des maux de dos persistant mon obligé de changer d'emploi
good,"Punch in greet people as i walk in to the clock."
good,I loved working there they just could offer me full time work which was what I needed so bad  so I had to move on to a job with fulltime hours + overtime.
good,"Everyday I come in I have to access what I will be doing and what others will have to work on. This usually includes working freight and stocking merchandise to the side counter. I work with a great team of other managers and love that we work well together as a team. The hardest part of my job is when there are multiple tasks and issues that need to be addressed but not enough time in one day to get them done, however this is part of the job I also enjoy the most, it makes me feel like I get a lot accomplished and that I can show I am a dependable and important part of the company."
good,"Good place to work, people are nice. Some of management can be hard to work with but fine none the less. The only thing I consider challenging is the customers."
good,Walmart has great benefits. But they expect more than most can achieve. The pay is really good and after 6 months and a year the benefits are wonderful.
good,A quiet but productive environment that allowed the workers to get the task done quick but at an effective pace. The managers were upbeat and always encouraging us to push ourselves.
good,Wal-Mart was an enjoyable and valuable experience place to work.  a typical day working at Wal-Mart consisted of replenishing depleted stock to the store shelves.
good,I am on the cash register checking people out. I like when It's busy because the day goes faster. I like talking to the customers. I've worked customer service in a lot of my jobs.
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work. It is a 24 hour 7 days a week operation that is safety, production and associate driven. There are all walks of like working at and with the company."
good,"Cashiering was interesting; interaction with customers can be fun/interesting. Working as Customer Host is enjoyable. Hardest part of Customer Host is waiting for breaks, etc. Management is fairly easy to get along with."
good,"In a life of a Walmart associate, depending on your current position but, begins with a daily tasks usually given from your direct management. Following up with those tasks and providing the correct knowledge to complete those tasks."
good,I like working with some of the other workers. Customers are not always satisfied. Communication with managers and employees is depending on click. If you are not in there click you will not be informed. I just want a new job.
good,"Walmart was overall a great experience for me, I was a minor when I started at Walmart so I did not get a lot of hours the first few weeks but management was very reasonable and understanding. On busy days time flies, on slow days it drags. The atmosphere is great benefits are great, one of my favorite jobs."
good,"I'd come to work on time, told what my duties were for my shift, and instantly get to work on it. I would mainly sweep certain areas of the store, mop the same areas, sometimes buff the floors. The manager(s) would be straight forward with me about certain issues, but would go to my superior for any issues about my work. The hardest part of the job was how my body would be by the end of the shift. Some days were easier then others. I couldn't handle the pain I experienced and there was no easy way for me to ease it, along with no care from the manager(s). The most enjoyable part of the job was the cleaning in general."
good,Working with wal-mat was highly repetitive yet fun. Customers where kind around the area and the management team was a well-knit group.i honestly enjoyed it.
good,Walmart has a lot of employees working for them . The management team needs to work more with the department managers and employees to help them get trained correctly.
good,"A typical day depending on department, can either be lax or demanding. Some departments have time specific duties which keeps you on your toes because of its fast pace nature be careful."
good,"Working at Walmart can be stressing because of the customers and the managers. Customers are really rude and have no respect towards the workers. The managers are very egocentric and only worry about their success rather than their associates. The associates can be friendly, depending on who you hang out with, but others are very childish and full of drama. The hours are very flexible if you talk to your managers. The store policy changes very often, so you have to have an open mind about changes. Raises are annually for less than a quarter. They also use you, they have you working higher paying jobs without paying you for it, so one has to be very careful in accepting to get trained without being switched over."
good,I would say that the people at Walmart have made my job. I love working with my direct manager. I always receive compliments for my hard work on the job.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. They do have opportunities for job advancement in the company. I recommend this company for a career path for anyone.
good,"Loved Wal-Mart the company but don't necessarily like the way management operated. A lot of lying and preferential treatment at the location I was at. However, Wal-Mart as a company takes care of their employees."
good,Walmart can be a good place to advance it’s provided a good job for me for the past 10 1/2 years. I was young when I started and have learned a lot since I started.
good,"The company overall has good benefits and advancement opportunities.  Some areas are very stressful because of limited help when sales increase and more work is necessary, but little or no help provided.  That said the help given to some areas at all times and they experience little stress."
good,Walmart is an interesting place to work. As one of the nation's largest retailers it is fast-paced and keeps their employees busy. Management is cooperative with our needs and provides good direction.
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you don't have kids. the work is pretty much is easy. you can learn a lot about the business working there. the hardest place of  the job is trying to get everything done by the end of your shift with helping customer too
good,I have been passed up multiple times over the years for promotions. They play favorites with the people in their cliques. They are racially and sexually bias.
good,"overall fun place to work. The mangament is absoutely amazing.   Would recommend working here to anyone. The staff was amazing.               ,         ."
good,I love Walmart. I love everything about. The customers are awesome and well mannered. The associates act more like family and work together as a team.
good,"Good place to work, management can be inconsistent. If I could work there again I definitely would. They offer great benefits, and are flexible to the needs of their employees."
good,Great job worked with great people enjoyed the company and pay the management was great caring and helpful and insightful to help each other. Time and people you meet was amazing and nice.
good,I liked working there but I’m not sure if I’d call it easy but it paid decently and I loved my co-workers in the deli. It probably depends on who your assistant manager is but for the most part they were alright.
good,"productive but not to fun workplace coz its too much work given to you without help from other employee, and the good  thing there is a new break room with nice sofa to relax. and the most enjoyable part of the job is when you receive you quarterly bonus"
good,"Walmart pharmacy has been like my second family. I have enjoyed learning new things as much as possible. It is a very high stress environment, but you get used to it. I love my regular customers and my coworkers, who all make it worth it. They have helped me find my way through a lot and I'll miss them when I have to leave."
good,Wal-Mart is laid back but also fast paced. The truck needs to be unloaded in a certain amount of time so that we can be out on the floor stocking the shelves.
good,It is a very fast paced environment. You must complete a lot of things in a certain amount of time before the managers do their walk through. The managers will over work you if you let them.
good,It's a great place to work. You get to learn different jobs at work and work with other people. Working on the sales floor keeps me busy and I stock items on the shelf.
good,"Provides good pay, benefits if needed. Most managers are great to work with who understand your concerns and needs. Flexible with working schedule. Employees are always great. Walmart is easy and enjoyable place to work. Able to build a solid career within the company."
good,I would go in a night to restock the shelves.  The only reason I left because the hours slowed down and I could not live off of 20 hours a week.  the people were great to work with
good,"The best place to work... Claims!   no issues, low management, no customers, less noise, small location, good supervisors, work as needed with low supervision."
good,I thought Walmart was Gone Be a lot To handle but when I got there it was a Very Nice and Easy Job to do and I liked working there and I would tell a lot people about it
good,"Honest work, the company tries to listen and grow with employee needs. They do ask for way too much mandatory overtime. They do lack in training. The people are fun and competitive. The warehouse is neat and organized."
good,Es una empresa donde constantemente te rolan de turno y de puesto sin el aumento de sueldo.
good,"Este trabajo ofrece pocas oportunidades para crecer profesionalmente, lo cual representa un estancamiento laboral para todos aquellos que esperamos formar una carrera laboral prospera."
good,"I love the work I do at wal-mart. I've held several Department Manager positions at Wal-Mart, I love learning new things. Each department is a little different in it's daily routine. The hardest part about the job is the lack of communication between managers as well as associates. Every manager is on a different page as to what they want from the associates. There is very little recognition for a job well done. You give them what they want and then they ask for more. There is very little appreciation. However Wal-mart does have great benefits and pay. We do earn paid time off. There is only one paid holiday. Wal-mart is a great place to work if you can deal with the stress of never actually knowing what is going on."
good,"Well I was employed at Walmart for a total of almost 10 years. A typical day at my job was first tell everyone ""Good Morning"", then I would head to the employees lounge and get a nice cup of coffee and sit and talk to fellow employees about our day. I would always get to work about 15-20 minutes early to get myself situated for the day. Then I would punch my time card and go to work."
good,meeting new customers every day and building relationships with your co-workers. I improved my customer service and answered customer questions and well as help with their needs. the hardest part of the job was dealing the everyday rude customers.
good,"Wal-Mart needs better management , simply because they don’t have any respect for the associates and they don’t know how to run their shifts . You will learn how to work under pressure and at a fast pace ."
good,I had this job in high school. I don't remember much about it in terms of if I was hired as a part time or full time employee. I would work from 3pm after school until 12am most of my shifts. It was a decent job for me; I worked the cash register and did it pretty well considering I barely got enough sleep due to homework and school. I ended up leaving due to my grades falling and worry over graduating.
good,"Walmart is overall a great place to work, particularly if you enjoy dealing with people.  It can become stressful during typical 'rush hours', before work/school, lunchtime, after school/work."
good,Ive worked for this company going on 15 years. Ive held many different job titles and have learned a lot about retail and how to manage my time and people
good,My day is fast paced and on a routine. Once my routine is completed then I go onto building features and do customer service. I do price changes and order when needed.
good,"I worked at Walmart for 2 years now.  It was my first job and I made several friends and had a good environment. There were some problems between management however and the managers did not meet the needs of the associates however and expected only two people to manage a high theft department such as Electronics.  It was a very difficult job, however, I learned a lot of things working at Walmart."
good,Wlamart is a place where you need alot time on your hands and have to be open to any hours. It get really difficult on pack days. You have to be prepared for anything.
good,uma boa empresa para se trabalhar com ótimo relacionamento entre os funcionarios
good,"Ao meu ver na ocasião, uma empresa que embora tivesse poucos benefícios, sempre havia processos seletivos internos, no sentido de contribuir no célere atendimento de promoção dos funcionários. Ainda ressaltar que a gestão contribuía nestes processos, bem como outros, sendo de lado ímpar com seus liderados."
good,"My manager was amazing, but when a company is constantly short handed it can be very stressful to the employees that show up everyday and have to pick up someone else's slack"
good,"Muy profesionales"
good,Wal-mart is a very good company to work for. the benefits are very good and they offer a lot of resources for your home life as well. however the new system that was put into place that generates the work schedules made it very difficult for me to get my son back and forth to school. that's the reason im leaving the company.
good,"Had great time working for WALMART "
good,working  there taught me how to work in a fast paced environment. It also taught me that there are many different types of managers that you will work for in your lifetime. I enjoyed meeting new people every day and the job that I did.
good,"The store i worked had started out as a really great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. The job was not very difficult physically or mentally, though my position was described at the most physically draining(Cap 2). Overall i think it was a great place to work, depending on how qualified the upper management team is"
good,"Nights or weekends were almost unavoidable.  Management was fair.  It was a discount store that valued the customers' bottom line highly."
good,Its very energetic. You can grow with in the company if you have the availability and whilingness. They work you hard but at the same time you gain knowledge and experience.
good,Walmart was a steeping stone for me and my journey in the work feild. I was working the cash register and learned how to interact with customers and have great customer experiences.
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work,  I enjoyed working their.  I was just unable to stand on my feet that many hours because of health problems. If not for that I would of stayed."
good,"The people are great but the job is hard on the body. You have a short amount of time to throw a lot of freight, then straighten the dept before morning"
good,"It’s a good job if you are working full time. Very consistent with the daily routine. Once you learn what you have to do, it’s very easy to stay on track and keep doing the same thing over on a daily basis."
good,I love my job but the customers are the worst part of my job. They come to me as a cashier and complain about pricing when I literally stand in one spot all day and have no control over them at all. The CSM's or Customer Service Managers are sometimes difficult. Are never where you need them to be and disappears at the strangest time. Coworkers are sometimes not the happiest being at work but we do share some good laughs.
good,"Working for Walmart taught me how to execute public speaking. This company have all types of life style benefits. Things like purchasing cars, home and, vacations."
good,face pace and great people to work with and for. A typical day at walmart is always busy which i like the best because im not a slow pace type person. there was nothing really hard bout working at walmart as long as you did what you needed to do.
good,"Clock in , sign on to a register and help the first customer. Bag their items, ask if they found everything ok. Or if they need anything else. Ask if they need help to their car. And then clock out."
good,"I have not worked for Walmart in several years. Therefore, I do not believe I can give a fair summary of this company. The culture is continually changing. Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse."
good,"Stock Shelves. Rotate Stock.Clean Up Cardboard And Empty Stack Empty Pallets. Boxes.I learned How To Stock Sheves,Rotate Stock And How To Use A Pallet Jack.Most Of The Managers Are Good To Work For."
good,"in my position there, the day started off really slow (it started at 6 a.m.) and progressively got faster until i left around 11:30 a.m. "
good,Fast pace and high demand. Able to create a great work family. Will work as much as possible with associates on scheduling needs to accommodate work life balance
good,honestly a great place to work i think the only thing that wasnt great about my experience was the way management handled a situation with my boss at the time. they had many associates come to them about this issue and they choose tell everyone they will fix it then did nothing and this boss is still there. i tried to change positions so i could keep my job and get away from my boss and they had no openings for months in other departments so i had to leave the company. They have great benefits and most of the staff at my store in particular were amazing
good,"Stocking shelves, setting up displays and end caps for new products, using a telxon for item look up,  Cashiering. Management easy to work with.  Hardest work was lawn and garden."
good,"I applied at walmart as I wasn't sure which path I wanted to take in life, and therefore I felt that it would be a good experience to learn skills. I enjoy the job that I do and enjoy who I work with, but do not plan to make it my career."
good,Employee problems never seem to matter to most managers some show interest run try to fix a problem others try to avoid to save time. Security in store could be better.
good,"The work days were typically full and employees were kept busy. Was trained in cash, food side retail, and all salesfloor activities. Favourite part of the job was co-workers and getting to work alongside them."
good,"very productive, busy and fast paced.a lot of different learning experiences. a lot of great people to work with.Is a job to be physically fit for,and very motivated."
good,"I have been with Walmart for 6 years, almost 7. I have worked in 3 different store locations. Most of the management and staff at the Corner Brook location are great."
good,if you are looking for a job in customer service and don't care how you are treated walmart is a place to work because they don't follow sam walton image the way should.
good,"I enjoyed my nights and learning about the store and the history, the bad part of the job is lifting things that weigh more than. Good co workers....."
good,"Constant work, no slacking but plenty of opportunities for raises and overtime. As long as you work hard it’ll pay of in the long run. Sometimes management is sketchy"
good,"never have to worry about hours, but if they lack help in other depts.they will pull you to help.i enyoyed my time there.walmart is the biggest in usa"
good,Walmart was a great place to work although coming out of a General Managers job in Rochester NY it was slightly disappointing to not be able to connect with a managerial position right away.
good,"let worker share management a new idea, give gifts to worker if he doing good. training every 6 months, protect the workers, opened mind. helping workers ."
good,"Wal-Mart was a fun place to work, most of the management were really great, and very helpful to associates. though the attendance policy and be quite unfair as it was in my case when i was given the ultimatum to quit or get fired when i needed time off for my dad's brain surgery"
good,I wish I was still there but things out of my control happened.  I really think the HR department should get fired for what happened to me but I'm just a number to them.
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent at Walmart for the most part. Some of management is amazing, and some of them are horrible. Often times, it's under-staffed throughout most of the store, which puts a lot of pressure on employees. Overall, it was still a great place to work for a number of reasons. They constantly find reasons to provide food for all of the employees (BBQs, pizzas, subs, etc.). There were quarterly bonuses if the store did well. They offer insurance after 1 year and PTO after 3 months (accumulates very slowly at first). They always worked with my scheduling needs. The pay system for long-time employees needs fixed. After 5 years, I was making what new people in the automotive shop were making; the bare minimum for my position."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, however the store manager was horrible. Other than that everything was good. The associates were friendly and everyone cared about you."
good,"Opened the cash office and started the daily procedures of balancing the office and imputing previous days sales."
good,"Walmart pays great. Your coworkers are usually wonderful. You learn a lot and lots of growth options. However, the management is so terrible that I cannot wait to quit."
good,It was a good place to work and money was good but management at my location was very poor and at times they didn't know themselves how to handle situations
good,I have been in wallmart for more then one and Half years and I have also worked in several departments but I started as a cashier and went and worked for other departments as well as of now iam working in pharmacy.
good,"The walmart company has a lot of good policies in place. The horror stories you read about low pay etc are mostly false. The only thing you really need to watch out for is upper management, but I feel like they are really only trying to satisfy their own bosses, who in turn are doing what they need to in order to keep walmart competitive and relevant."
good,"I loved the job itself however the managers were difficult to work with because we had about 3 different manager and 4 different leads. Their lack of communication made it difficult to really understand the correct protocol of my job. Rules were constantly changing between them and sometimes we were not aware. However I did love this job and enjoyed the hours, pay, and benefits."
good,"Productive and an enjoyable place to work while balancing your schedule with other daily means such as school, children or career advancements. Positive place to work."
good,"Overall, I feel like Walmart is a stepping stone for most. Being employed at Walmart is a good first experience or good first taste into the world of retail. It's normally fast paced and busy. Who doesn't go to Walmart for SOMETHING? With that being said, I've been employed by two different Walmart stores and in two different counties. Both places I have some positive experiences to remember. At my first store I started out as a cashier, it was a new experience for me in retail. I didn't know what I was up against, but I had VERY LITTLE to no training. It was a busy time of year and the store was a little under staffed. That was a down side for me just starting my first night, but it also pushed me to learn! 6 months later I was promoted to Customer Service. About 2 years later, I transferred due to moving. I continued my Customer Service position and about 6 months later the store was under a remodel, opening a  Money Center. Once the remodel was over and the Money Center was opened, I was welcomed to a new position. Which detailed check cashing, numerous different bill payments, wire transfers all over the world and money orders. Walmart is a huge franchise with most stores being fairly large, sometimes things fall out of place. Examples being a HUGE lack of communication, levels of respect in some cases, lack of management and poor scheduling issues. There's something to take from each job! Make a positive experience and have a positive outcome!"
good,"Como prioridade somente a gerencia precisa rever a inflexibilidade, pois assim como a empresa seus funcionários também possuem necessidades e nem sempre o funcionário pode abrir mão pela empresa é necessário que o cenário contrario aconteça as vezes, pois dessa maneira evita colocar o funcionário em um situação onde deve fazer uma escolha difícil, consequentemente evita a alta rotatividade de funcionários dentro da empresa."
good,"Good place to work, fair salary for the work that I do. They have longer training now so you can get to your full potential and most employees work together."
good,walmart is fun place to be especially if it’s the super Walmart you get to do many things to keep you busy. Customer will come in a bad mood but our job is to make them feel welcomed to a place where they can shop.
good,"A rotina de trabalho, é o atendimento ao fornecedor e ao associado, referente ao RH, tesouraria e afins, elaborar planilhas, controle de gastos da empresa, controle de despesas de gás, luz e água das lojas. pagamento, férias e faltas dos associados.Aprendi a desenvolver um atendimento com excelência, habilidade nos programas SAP, e programas internos da empresa, e a elaborar planilhas de controle."
good,"Great employees to work with.  "
good,"Interesting and fun working with the coworkers and customers."
good,foi uma empresa onde aprendi muito e me fez crescer um pouco pois comecei como terce rizado em com o decorrer do tempo fui promovido para trabalhar na própria walmart e depois fui promovido para auxiliar administrativo foi minha ultima função.
good,"With how few registers they have after getting a lot of self checkout registers, you would have to constantly be rushing through checking people out because the lines would be filled with people that don’t like the self checkouts. I learned how to manage my time effectively especially when I got to be a backup csm so I could get all my tasks done and take care of the customers and my fellow associates. It’s a good place to move up at if you show the managers that you have a good work ethic. You also get along really well with everyone and it has a family like vibe. I met some of my closest friends and my boyfriend there."
good,"I greeted customers, handled transactions, performed monetary tasks requested from management, handled minor customer complaints. I loved working with the vibrant community that entered Walmart's doors."
good,"The day starts with checking email for any new information or policy change.  Attend a meeting with supervisors to align with the priorities of the day and set time schedule a future time to tour their area.  Work side by side with associate to strengthen any training opportunities.  After lunch take care of some administration duties such as prepare schedules, conduct personal meetings, reconcile bank statements, and prepare financial reports."
good,"i enjoy working with my fellow associates Walmart is cutting back on call ins you now get 5 points in a year for missing time for being out use to get 9 in 6 months you get now 1 point if during Monday thru Friday ,2 points if on weekend and if Holiday you get 3 points  This is really bad if you really get flu on a weekend Holiday! Instead of getting 2 weeks vacation after 5 years each year you have to wait to accumulate them like 2 hours every 80 hours or so"
good,"loved working for the company, there was not always capable management and they sometimes played favorites. the pay was comparable to other jobs of similar qualities"
good,"My shift would start at 2pm, My team and management would have a quick meeting then we would start unloading the truck. after the truck we would go to our scheduled breaks and afterwards start stocking our given departments until 11pm."
good,"The management team is very by the book and no in between, however some of the customers and co workers make the job much more enjoyable. They really push for employees to ask customers to apply for store credit cards."
good,"The work and was slow but relaxing. Management was lenient and understanding, My coworkers were very easy to work and get along with. Not always stimulating and felt like a drag at times."
good,Was a great place to work. Always have nice friendly people there. Management was understanding. Most the tome was a fast pace working environment. You would get pulled to work in other areas when you had down time.
good,There is hardly ever a dull moment through out your shift. This place gives you lots of useful experience. The management varies depending on the person. The people who work here are usually friendly and respectful. The hardest part is working the customer service desk. The most enjoyable part of working here was being able to work with such friendly people.
good,I learned how to have great customer service skills ans to be polite to every person who walks through the doors.I also learned how to use a telezon and printer and how to make shelf and inventory labes.
good,Was only a contracted worker for walmart as a sales associate. Management varies as there are a lot of them. Customers are as controversial as ever and the pay was good.
good,"somewhat stressfull"
good,helped customers threw out the store. i ran a cash register . i learned how to deal with angry customers . management was constantly on us to monitor customers . the culture was very diverse.
good,wal Mart was a very production based job so I was kept very busy unloading trucks and processing freight. I enjoyed the competitive workplace. I was not pleased when I had to re locate.
good,at that time a male supervisor treated me unfairly and at that time we couldnt communicate well.  He no longer works there now. But the other supervisors were great as far as communitcation and work attitudes.
good,The teams are great as long as you are willing to communicate and talk things out with your fellow workers. The place is stress free as long as the management is good and they are willing to work with you.
good,Walmart distribution is a good job to work for if your looking for a set schedule. It is a hard job and physical labor. You can dress comfortable with no dress code
good,Getting to know my customers.  Working in different departments. Seeing smiles on every face. Unloading and loading trucks. Stocking shelves. And greeting customers.
good,"It’s really fun but at times they expect so much for you when you’ve just started. They literally just stick you in with little trainging, causing you to get stressed a lot about the work you want to finish."
good,Good place to work with good management and a lot of ways to move up or be promoted. Good people and a fast paced environment with good pay and good benefits.
good,"If you work hard you get noticed and get rewarded. I was just a pharmacy associate, but worked really hard and managers saw my work and promoted me fast. I loved being a manager at Wal Mart , yes it was stressful sometimes but it was worth it."
good,"Working at Walmart is a fun job,Long fun hours of work,you learn to have patience an meet new people,da hardest part of the job is waiting on time to fly by and the best part of working there is getting your own money"
good,"I enjoy working with the public, and my position was only for Christmas help, but I would like work at Walmart for more hours, because I enjoy working with the public and get along with all my co-workers ."
good,The job was fairly decent if my manager was a little better I would still be there.I had my schedule changed constantly without a word told to me and would get absences without knowing
good,Very busy beach town grocery. Liked working there but would have preferred a different location in the store. Walmart is a good company to work for.   They care about their employees. And did feed us after the hurricane.
good,En general el ambiente de trabajo es bueno por la comunicación entre compañeros de trabajo.
good,It was a ok job hours sucked and where all over not paid enough good managers good cultire and work mates must be able to be yelled at by customers and not lash out
good,We were responsible for multiple dept. We did not have enough coverage to get the jobs done. I had to pick merchandise from high shelf's using a ladder which was not safe.
good,"I had a great management team at my home store, but there are some locations that do not. It is a mixed bag with Walmart, but they are pretty fair with their wages and benefits are okay."
good,"I enjoy working at walmart. It gains alot of experiences on multiple things,great customer service and being productive. I liked the managers and my co workers and it was good to as a team instead of on your own. Always willing to help and encourage the responsibilities tha are held accountable."
good,Walmart Is a great place to advance if you go for it and you have to wait until  its available. The company has its pros and its cons. but over all its a good company.
good,The good thing about working at Walmart if that you meet new people on a daily basis the job can be challenging but it has its ups and downs I have good days and bad days Walmart is changing to a new system that it’s very challenging but once it comes to gather it would be a great idea but is going to cut hours from the associates
good,Managers try to accomodate the needs of good workers.  Frequent lack of attention to scheduling resulting in a shortage of staff for busy times.  Slow response to needed replacement and repair of equipment.
good,Great place to work. Very flexible and works with you. You get PTO and vacation. No holiday pay. We get bonuses. Just wish that management would pay more attention to the team and get rid of the people who don't pull their weight.
good,"1 tip I can say is stay focused, build your career & do not get caught up in anybody's nonsense. it was really a highschool experience due to the gossiping & some of the altercations. The salary is very good & they'll let you set your schedule."
good,"customers came first, meet or exceed  for satisfaction,"
good,Pretty good job overall. A lot of fast paced work but nothing that most people can’t handle. I’m pretty most of the store are the same. Not a bad job if you work hard you will get hours.
good,"Expectations of a good environment  to work in approved. Easy, fun, friendly coworkers everyone helps when needed. Management cares about all employees, just one big family."
good,"i loved my job but management was pretty poor quality, other than that i think they are very flexible with your needs on working schedules and asking for deparments transfers."
good,"The pay in the Walmart Pharmacy is extremely competitive for any pharmacy in Fayetteville, NC. The manager I had however was horrible. He created a horrible work environment, didn't know how to run the pharmacy and talked about employees to others. It was almost like a bullying type of environment. I never would've left if it wasn't for the change in management and lack of any help from above management when concerns were brought up."
good,"Loved the people I worked with, just having something to do nonstop was the best. Never a time to just stand around is what I loved! The environment and customers in Durango always had an awesome vibe easy going and friendly"
good,"jornada de 8 horas mas 1hra de comida, el horario es flexible, mañana, tarde y noche (se le llama velada de mes), te encargas de alarmar la tienda en general, vitrinas, checar temperaturas de congelados, rondin en la tienda y cuando te toca estar en monitores tienes que estar observando detalle a detalle un posible robo de mercancia, etc..."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart in Perry. However, I was let go after I got sick and was hospitalized. When I came back, they fought me on being approved to use a stool and my doctor prescribed oxygen. I had been told my LOA was approved but was then denied. It rolled me to termination level on attendance and I was let go. The Manager was extremely rough on the Cashiers."
good,Walmart is a retail store with lots of advancement opportunities... I have learned alot of skills working there... The associates work very well together to get any job done...
good,"Responsible for clearing, verifying and researching Accounts Payable, Claim and Vendor Invoices, Vendor Payment, preparing stores for inventory and Credit Memo’s for 16 stores on a monthly basis."
good,"A day in Walmart is busy from the time you clock in to you clock out."
good,Absolutely loved working here. Moved up in the ranks fairly quick and everyone was great to work with. If I could go back I would no questions asked. Discount was also great.
good,"Where I worked was in Wisconsin Dells, big vacation town in the summer. Working there is different than others. It's horrible, and has more issues I care to list, but of the people who managed to transfer to other locations sing the praises of not being in that madhouse. All of my issues really are based on the location, and everything to due with just the job was really good. The benefits available are amazing, and they really do try to care about their employees."
good,"We had BBQ Christmas diners  contest on photographer "
good,"Walmart can be a place to thrive if you are willing to work hard, and listen to those around you. In order to thrive at Walmart you have to understand the values Walmart has as a company and incorporate those into your work everyday. You also have to be willing to learn new things, even if you don't think it applies to your current role because it might help you get a new role at another time."
good,Good management. Nice co workers. Advancement opportunities. Decent paid time off. Not generous with the overtime. Typical retail job. Bonuses quarterly
good,Would have to cover several departments by myself though out the week as well as my own. Stock freight for my department and go up front on register if needed. Would help do department manager duties for other departments with out the pay.
good,Working for them was really interesting it was my first real job in sales pitching and customer service. I would say it was fast paced and then slow paced randomly but it was overall a good experience.
good,"Most of my experience at Walmart is positive. The only downfall I have seen is inexperienced or really long term managers know nothing about managing people, lots of favoritism."
good,"Throwing 2,000-3,000 piece trucks was my favorite task for Stocking and Recieving, consistent lifting of heavy and light merchandise for 2, sometimes 3 hours without any break points until all merchandise is thrown. Consistently show my leadership when assigned to any task. Poor management relations with hourly associates is the biggest downfall of this certain store number. CAP 2 stock associates are disruptive, slacking on duties towards end of shift. Supervisor tends to leave CAP 2 unsupervised, leaving time for horseplay."
good,"I loved my job but I was hired for part time, and for the last few years, have had over 32 hours a week, and it was killing me."
good,"I submitted an application online in June of 2018. About 2 weeks later I received a call from the local Personnel Coordinator about an interview.  I went to the interview and was hired on the spot. I had another job at the time as well (which came about after I had given my availability as ""Open"" and when I explained this was told to make a new Availability request and they worked with me to give me hours and training to get up to speed.  When my schedule at the other job changed it was easy to change my Availability with the store.  When I quit the other job again it was easy to change my Availability to get more hours.  In short, they have worked with me like few employers I have worked for ever have."
good,"Serca de mi domicilio, buen ambiente de trabajo facilidad de cambiar de are."
good,fairenough employee comforts but in some areas compensation should be based on performance not job description. almost too much management involvement in day to day low level operations
good,Walmart no es un mal trabajo y paga bien pero los jefes aveces te hacen tu dias malos
good,"Nice place and good environment to work, friendly people, safe place and the manager and employees are very kind.I learned how to build a bicycle and to use my tools."
good,une journée de travail pour moi et une journée ou je n'ai pas le temps de regarder ma montre car je suis tellement concentrer sur mon travail que le temps passe tout seul.
good,"I worked overnights, it was pretty relaxed. Coworkers are friendly, great staff. Just make sure if no one else wants to do things the right way, that you do."
good,Overnight stocking had a small curve of figuring out how to prep your aisles for stocking. Management always made sure to lead some projects and check up on workers and their progress of stocking their assigned aisles.
good,"I quite enjoyed working for this company. The benefits were great and the pay was good. I don't have any real complaints about working here as the staff were friendly and helpful, and management actually seemed to care. I would definitely recommend someone to work here again, as I have recommended a few people to do so in the past. "
good,Wal mart management lacks but for a not so good company the pay is actually pretty good. They start off more than minimum wage so that was good. Hours are not so good
good,During my employment at wal-mart i felt i was treated fairly and with respect. there was not much surprise to what a work day consist but i enjoyed it.
good,"J'aime bien le gestion, l'ambiance et l'ambiance. On est une famille d'associés chez Wal-Mart. On a des avantages et un milieu de travail exceptionnel."
good,"Walmart has had a good history of trying to take care of it customers and it's associates. The company makes you feel welcome and important no matter how insignificant the task seems. You go in help the customers, finish your tasks and go home for the day. No matter how rough the day can get, you can always talk to some of your fellow associates. After a while you realize that everyone working there are your second family. The hours can get weird at times but the health benefits, 401K, and stocks make up for it."
good,"Walmart is a great company with competitive pay and a wonderful opportunity for advancement.  One best way, if followed, works.  In my experience, it’s not always one best way.  I have been there over 5 years and moved from job to job within the company so I could get more experience.  If you have a strong management team, it’s a great place to work."
good,it is a good place to work but they a high turnover because they do not want to pay their employees enough money for what they expect from you they change to many things at once
good,I enjoyed my job at wal-mart and contrary to popular believe they treat their employees really well. Management is great from team leads up to store Ceo's. I loved my hours and my team. I probably would have stayed there if I didn't receive a high paying offer.
good,"I am a CAP2, meaning my work day starts as 2:00 pm unloading truck for 2 hours. The job is fast paced and somehow laborious, but we are just enough for the shift unless an associate calls in. We have 15 minute break after unloading the truck before each associate goes to stock goods where he is assigned in the sales floor.  We have a hour lunch break at 6:00 pm before going back to work up to 9:00 pm then another 15 minutes break and call it a day at 11:00 pm. "
good,"Working in a top tier superstore is very fast paced, you must make the majority of decisions on the fly . If you can not you will fail.There are great advancement opportunities ."
good,If you looking to work as a part time Walmart would be a great option although i never tried working full time there but I don’t think that would be a good option.
good,It was very nice working there sometimes it got really busy. Management wasn't very good about having a good amount of people scheduled. Overall my experience wasn't bad.
good,"As a full time student, Walmart made sure to be flexible and understanding of the busy student schedule. They were fair with hours and could balance a good work to study ratio. The hardest part of working at Walmart was the miscommunication that could take place between associates and management. Overall, it was a great place to work as a part time employee."
good,"Its easy money and a fun and friendly work place but there managers are horrible, rude and full of attitude. They help you out when they can but when mistakes happen or you forget to do something they don't always understand even when the day is busy and stressful."
good,Caring coworkers and fun place to work.  Even after you leave you still belong.  The pay is good for the work and the work isn't hard to do at all.  Its not a bad place to work.
good,"I unloaded the semis."
good,"My job I totally loved, I spent more time at my job then I did at home,but unfortunately when you have a bad department manager it makes it difficult to get things done on time & the completed task properly finished and set correctly. ....but in those times that I dont have to do all those task, I totally LOVED working in my department as a CAKE DECORATOR at Laurens, SC Walmart."
good,I would actually suggest this job for your first job because it fun and I work with friends so it’s fun.you do get an hour break.if your having financial trouble someone will help you.
good,"On a typical day at Walmart, I would usually open up the Deli and set everything up so we can start cooking food. I was also able to work in produce and stock fruit while also cross training in bakery to learn how to prepare donuts and bread. I learned how to work well around a team and also take a leadership role when supervisors and managers were not on the job. Since I worked a with a lot of foreign people who have a similar background as me, I was able to help supervisors and managers communicate with employees because I was bilingual. Management had its ups and downs, as from time to time there would be lack of communication between the manager and the employees and therefore would result in missed orders, products not being stocked, or overall just slowing down the pace of the workplace. The workplace was very welcoming, everybody treated each other like family and communication between the associates was very strong. The hardest part of the job was the constant schedule changes that associates would make which would make it harder on others because now we had to pick up shifts that didn't suit us. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone was generous and if you didn't know how to do something, associates who were experienced, were more than happy to help you."
good,Focus on your job only and not other peoples’  tasks. Unless you finish early and still have hours left to your day. Then provide help to other departments.
good,"But I had to work a lot of overtime to make ends meet.  I know they do pay a little more now. It has been 4 years since I worked there. I liked my managers. The people working there, not so friendly. If you do your work as asked, you will be treated decently."
good,"Good international opportunities, strong e-commerce team. Focus on growth in grocery and health and wellness. Strong culture within the pricing and cost analytics departments."
good,I enjoyed working there and had fun doing it and made alot of friends. Some of tue managers i didn't like and that was one of the reasons why i didn't enjoy working there.
good,I like working for Walmart. Sometimes it bothered me when we were slow but for the most part we were pretty fast-paced. The employees are for the most part friendly and willing to help anyone.
good,"Good place to work.Most employees are great team players and will work together to finish the task at hand."
good,"Working for Walmart was fun and exciting. "
good,The company has career choices that span the complete spectrum from store retail to corporate level legal. You can go into almost any career as long as you have the drive and the education to back it up.
good,overall Walmart has an great work environment .Coworkers are very wonderful and the mangers are professional but their system that they have there  is kind of not understanding.
good,"hardest part of the job is holidays or busy days  "
good,They want more and more and that we are going lose work at the first of the year. My wife is a  delivery  Driver for y’all she loves it .She use work at Walmart to she knows it’s hard .
good,It was a good customer service company to work for you kept the same daily routine but one day may be busier than the last.  Customer service was key in this type of environment.
good,"Not a hard job, a lot of management changes,  some managers will work with you, some will not. Some communicate well on up coming changes, but sometimes you find out stuff last minute."
good,"I enjoyed my job, however there several things concerning management and the benefits that were not inspiring.worked on cash register, in pharmacy, and as a door greeter."
good,the work isnt hard  and the pay is nice its just tedious having to stand there all day ringing up customers thing that are sometimes rude and or ignorant
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. I started off as a cashier then decided i wanted to try something else so i switched to working om the floor. It wasint too bad of a job its just some of the supervisors were not fit to be a supervisor. But other than that it was good.
good,"This was my first job. I worked in the pharmacy, as a cashier, and in the electronics center. I had great coworkers and it kept me busy. The pay is higher than some other retail jobs. Plus you get a discount (which I used everyday). "
good,The over all management was great. Delegation was fair and within worker ability. Teamwork was highly valued. The worst parts of the job where really only corporate exceptions and communication with the trucks. The best were the people you work with.
good,"they had a great work environment but management consistently butted heads and threw each other and their associates under the bus. It was a life consuming job and they worked you very hard. The money was okay, but not worth the stress and effort you are required to put in."

good,"Walmart can be a great place to work for depending on the location. it has ups and downs like any place, it is fast paced especially in a big store in a heavy populated location. management varies from store to store but overall not a bad place to work for."
good,You were taught everything you needed to know to do your job well.The store I worked in had an open door policy. The hours could be long  but you were always to take your breaks and lunches.
good,"I check emails, meeting with the team and assign tasks for the day."
good,"There is never a dull moment in retail. There is always work to do and one of my favorite things about retail is the customers and meeting new people. You have to have a friendly, hard working personality, to make this type of job worthwhile.  "
good,only thing I really liked was the fact that they let us have an break for a hour. we actually had time to eat a good meal. even though it sometimes was not a benefit
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you dont have kids. Sceduals are flexable and fair."

good,Bom trabalho bom pessoas boas salário ruim mais rápido contratado

good,"If you are looking for a job that will pay the bills and be steady work, Walmart is a great place to start.  They have made a lot of changes over the last few years that are not great for the employees, but they do still have sla few things going for them."
good,"Objetivos agresivos, cambios de acuerdo al contexto económico. Horarios rotativos. Un descanso semanal. Un solo domingo libre al mes. Buen clima entre compañeros y superiores. Excelente relación con cada uno de ellos."
good,"you clock in and check with your department manager as to what the priorities are for the day, check shelves to see what you are out of straightening up shelves as you go, go to backroom gather out of stock items bring them to floor and stock shelves, dust as you go and help any customers in your area. If called to front , stop what you are doing go to front and get on a register to get the crowds at registers down. return to department pick up where you left off.

good,"This job had 2 parts for me, the opener shift, and the midshift. The opener shift was 4AM-1PM, and involved sorting the new freight, filling the wall up from the night before, and date/quality checking the meat wall. The 9AM-4PM midshift was less organized, and usually involved me helping out the manager with large jobs, or working the frozen and dairy coolers in order to clear up backroom space for new freight. This job has taught me how to be thorough when given a task, how to manage less experienced employees, and how to improvise when unexpected problems arose. The hardest part of the job was the constant switching between the 4AM shift, and the 9AM shift due to the inconsistent sleep schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely my coworkers/managers, they made it fun to work there for the most part."
good,Walmart Canada has allowed me to grow and refine my customer service skills as well as my management and teamwork skills. There is a nice sense of structure in my daily activities while also allowing consistent and reward work.
good,Walmart was a good place to work. I got all the training I needed to do my job. I was usually not overworked unless it was very busy. The busy times helped me lean how to multitask.
good,"I liked working at Walmart, the people were good, the job was easy. There was nothing hard being a cashier or customer service. Mgmt was not around much especially if you worked in lawn and garden."
good,"Over all a great place to work. Flexible hours. Close to home. Gave us breaks every 2 hours, because we are on our feet for so long. Helped us whenever we needed it."
good,"This job is physically demanding. Ive seen older people stress over the demand of this job and the management can be very unprofessional at times. overall the people there work to make money, and leave. If you're fast and like physical work, you'll do fine."
good,I love my job but not the pay and my hours are not 40 because I don’t have an open availability to work. The experience I’ve had at Walmart has given me opportunities to learn different things in different departments but not more pay .
good,Good clean store. great prices and variety of products.  Staff are mostly friendly and management is average .Not very helpful to co workers.  Not a family oriented place sometimes.
good,typical work in retail. the ways were easy to pick up on as well as the knowledge learned is well over enough to survive off of. so well thought out easy to work
good,Buena empresa con muchos valores que hacen de esta empresa una de las mas grandes en el país.
good,Worked in the Garden centre maintaining the plans=ts and selling gardening needs and products. It was a summer job. Great work environment where the company made you feel appreciated.
good,Walmart is a great sturdy job if your not trying to live above your means and are single. I loved the people i interacted with amd the majority ofmy coworkers. Management at the location i worked could have been better but overall is a great first place to work or a great place to work in general.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart and I would do it again in a heartbeat. There's a Walmart in just about every town so transfer would be possible if you need or just want to to move. The employees are very nice. They have good breaks and benefits. Schedules are flexible.
good,"You come in and do the work, it's fine..."
good,"I had a fun time working at wal-mart. It was a great and fun learning experience. I made a lot of friends with the people that work there, including most of the managers. It's a tough but fair work environment."
good,"We came to work ready and prepared by starting our shift off with a meeting. discussed our sales for the day, previous day, and previous year. Delegated task to associates and followed up to ensure task were completed. Management was always helpful and went out of their way to help myself move up in the company and learn new things. The hardest part of the job was working overnight and having work/life balance."
good,I would recommend working for Walmart. Plenty of room for advancement with great benefits and bonuses each quarter. I have learned a lot over the last 6 years.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart.  I loved interaction with the people and found the managers fair and easy to work for.   After clock in, you would be assigned a register, and you  would then total up the amount of the purchase.  The hardest part of the job would be if someone had something very heavy and it had to be lifted onto the counter.  Mnagement was for the most part friendly and fair.  The workplace was clean and please.."
good,"Walmart is a solid first or intro job, they'll pretty much hire anyone.  higher management were pretty rude and have high expectations of jobs they've never worked"
good,"empresa ótima e dinâmica,agradável.boa de se trabalhar"
good,"Working there was fun, but the pace was hectic and advancement opportunities were scarce.Many employees seemed not to be ambitious, so the overall environment was not as challenging as I would have liked."
good,"I love to See Our Customers Happy by helping them to everyday needs and how I just love to see their  response in Body Language and Tone of voice ."
good,"Great to learn with. Very consistent with great people and a starting game where we won free merch. Lots of room for advancement."
good,I was only at Walmart for a short period at the Call Center.  My manager was very helpful and the employees there were very friendly.  The job itself was very repetitious.
good,Working conditions is fair and attendance is a must they are limited to being flexible nothing is excused hours are good and so is pay with limited job opportunities
good,"It's not as bad as you will hear from alot of people roll with it it's a good place to work. It has its moment like everywhere else i reccomend giving it a year at least..it gets easier "
good,"Walmart is a fluid company.  Be prepared for things to change, week to week, even day to day.  Rules change, management changes.  You have to learn to go with the flow or you will be booted out the door."
good,"A typical day at work is fulfilling customers orders, receiving orders and dispensing orders. I have learned time management skill. The hardest part of the job is when customers orders are delayed or shipped to the wrong store. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers and helping them."
good,"I love my job as an Online Grocery Associate picking and dispensing orders for customers. It is a full time, 5 am to 2 pm job. My job gets more challenging as orders increase and I am asked to help with the department manager responsibilities. Also, being able to satisfy the customer is rewarding. Know that the customer is happy is number one. I would like to be able to move up in the company but there isnt really that opportunity. I have been with the company almost 4 years and i would like to move to a more challenging and rewarding position. Sometimes it is hard to get a pat on the back from management."
good,Buena empresa pueden pagar un poco más para que dure un poco más su personal.
good,I was hired as cashier but was only a student and didn't get that many hours first when I commenced working there. I checked the schedule and it didn't appear
good,"A  Typical  day  includes  dealing  with  customers  needs,  merchandising  , setting  up  displays  and  merchandise. The most  enjoyable  part  of  the  job  is building  relationships with  the  customers."
good,"The job is helping me get through college. The hours can fluctuate and that is not always good for my bills but I usually have enough to maintain my bills,"
good,it is not a bad job. Long work weeks always working overtime. In this area moving up is not easy most people who get management don't ever leave so leave almost no room to move up.
good,"working overnight was okay as long as you can restock the store, help late night shopper with a friendly smile plus bring the store back alive(presentable) before the store opens or sunrise."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, com bastante organização."
good,"Everyday started off with a meeting talking about how everything is going around the store. It was usually lighthearted unless we had a busy shift where we would talk about what was expected of us and where we could help if we finished our task early. Management was usually understanding and tried to help where they could, which made it pretty easy for me to work there. Other employees were very approachable and I was content working with them. The most difficult part of the job was knowing that what you had to do that day was urgent, but still making sure that the customer felt welcomed and could always get help if they needed it. The most fun was my old manager, he'd always make conversation and help where he could. He would make sure that we felt welcomed and would try to cook food for us once a week. Working at Walmart is bearable if you work with the managers and keep up."
good,Nunca tube problemas en la empresa ni con su personal asi que recomiendo esa empresa para trabajar despues de guardia estube en cctv por la misma empresa pero externalizaron la central
good,"Walmart is a great store. The customer is always right. Some times it's fast, some times it's slow. Have to stay busy during these times. The benefits are very great."
good,"Walmart isn't a bad to place to work. Quarterly incentives are good if there are no accidents within your store, advancement is ok, pharmacy is continuously changing without notice giving more responsibility to technicians without proper training. It gets frustrating."
good,It was a great place to work. Everyone who works there are great to be around and work with. Depending on which shift you works the job might be a little different. Working night shift was fun but some of the people there caused a lot of drama.
good,It could be a better work environment. To many “Bosses” wanting to tell everyone what to do and how. Other than that everything is pretty cool about this job.
good,I enjoyed working in the frozen/dairy area of the store. It was cold but i managed to get the job done.  The customers were great and my co workers kept me laughing and feeling great about my job.
good,It was a great place to work. It was long days that I worked though. Sometimes there would be 15 hour days. Then when I came home I barely had time to anything personal or spend time with my family.
good,I've worked at Wal-Mart for 10 years and it has helped me know what to expect in a work place. It has given me a lot of experience working with people and helping customers.
good,I am grateful for the opportunity to work for one of the world's largest retailer .  It is a good place to work-- good customer service is expected.  I enjoy my time working at Walmart.  Pay is low benefits are descent when compared to other companies.
good,"For me, the job was great, unless a person who was not supposed to be around me showed up. My co-workers were my family.  They would give me a restroom break when my abusive ex showed up and tried to go through my line.  I am still in touch with them."
good,"Walmart gives you paid time off. But, if you have a store manager like mines your not allowed to take vacation more then 7 days even though PTO is YOUR time."
good,"I enjoy working there especially, enjoy working with different-2 people but only problem was uncertain working hours every day and very low salary."
good,"Walmart goes thru a lot of people because of unrealistic production goals. They believe you should get your own work done, then do everybody else's too! Some managers do not know how to correct mistakes on the cash register."
good,"My coworkers at Walmart were more like family, everyone treats everyone with respect and that's what I loved so much about Walmart. Besides management"
good,"It was usually busy work days & nights, I learned how to provide excellent customer service. Management was usually not a problem. The hardest part of the job was the work schedules & working on all of the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many people and working together as a huge team."
good,"Everyone is friendly although not all are polite. Sometimes employees talk to other associates rather than talk to customers, providing a friendly atmosphere that the customer would want to come back to."
good,"At the Walmart I was in the customers were not too bad except the occasional bad apple, and the work pace was in really extreme waves. But if there are not many customers then you can easily get your other work done, but alot of the time you are too busy and understaffed to be able to get much else done. and about half of the management are really cool and actually care about doing their best and helping you succeed, but the other half only care about very specific things and think if you dont get something they want done that you are just lying and are lazy."
good,Boa empresa antes da ocorrência da venda. Espero que as coisas mudem
good,"Walmart Plainwell, MI  November 2016  August 2018, Responsible for cash systems Responsible for cash flow, Front line customer service, Customer service"
good,Taking stock in and pushing stock out to ensure the customer has everything available to them. I learned to better myself as a customer service representative. Management was good they were around when you needed them to be and helped when they could. The workplace is great good people who are ready to teach if your ready to learn. Trying to connect to the inventory system was always a hassle but making sure customers left happy was always the best part of my day
good,we had  to follow a shift schedule sometimes it was different I stayed for the job in the area this was the best wages a small town no jobs seemed there were a lot of families working in the Management dept and it was about who you knew
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, i learned a lot on the job and how to manage my time and workers i got to work one on one with customers and grew a lot in this company."
good,"Great work atmosphere with dependable work hours each week. There is 1-week of paid training through audio, video, and written training materials. Once you’ve passed the formal training, you constantly learn on-the-job, and all employees are happy to help you."
good,Enjoyed my position but management left something to be desired. Promotion from within the company is excellent. Considerate of those with disabilities.
good,Its hard to be a good associate when your management team has favoritism. Who wants to work with people who only discipline certain associates while others can do as the please!
good,Overall Walmart is a good place to work. There are a lot of options for working here. There is an opportunity for advancement. Cashiering at Walmart is the last place the customer visits. Keeping up with the demand of customers cashiering can also be a very stressful thing. The Holidays are the worst part of cashiering and there never seems to be enough cashiers scheduled during normal business hours to meet the needs of customers.
good,I loved working there I just wish the managers would work together and all be on the same page about everything going on! But other than that the people are friendly and everyone works together to get things done.
good,"at times it can be stressful to work at Walmart, I did enjoy overnight stocking the best. we had a great team and we all pulled together to get the job done."
good,When I am at the customer service desk I enjoy greeting and serving the customers. The challenge of solving and meeting their needs is at times complicated but very satisfactory when achieved. Working and mentoring new employees have been one of the best advantages that I have brought to the company.
good,Good place to learn. Highly corporate culture. Very Structured workplace with unlimited potential for growth. The hardest part of the job is conflicting direction from home office and store management.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be clocking in, then I'd head to my department in electronics and began to organize the DVD's and video games. Afterwords I'd get on the cash register. After about an hour on the register I'd work the floor. Helping customers and maintaining the aisles. I'd take my lunch break and returne back to work afterwards. At the end of the day I'd help with the clean up and lock up. Before I leave the building I'll go to management and sign out the lock up keys for electronics department. I've learned to never leave the company building with the Keys, keep the aisles clean as possible and clear, to always keep work space clean, and if a customer askes me a question and I do not know the answwer; tell them that I don't know the answer to their question I can get a manager for them to answer the question.  The hardest part about my job would be working for rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with other co-workers."
good,It was my first job. I started off in the seasonal side. But advanced passed that into more of a field that was recommended base off how I was performing. Which tells you that the employees look out for you even the fellow co-workers are there to be of service. As everyone is always looking to eat and walmart is there to provide for that.
good,Walmart has helped me grow in my professional journey and I have enjoyed the 13 years I have been there. I like the support they give the community and this country in s time if need.
good,Id go back to walmart if they were able to give me the schedule I need as a single parent. They were great at making sure their employees made 40 hours a week
good,"I enjoyed working customer service at Wal-Mart  and a Customer Service Manager. I really enjoyed helping the customers. Because I worked at a Market Place, I was able to have a re-pore with many of our customers. I always liked the idea that I could resolve many issues the customers would have with out having to always go to management"
good,"I worked various shifts through different times with the company in a few locations - it's been a mixed bag between good and bad managers and positions, with hours bouncing around."
good,"Decent salary, decent managers, easy going job, easy training, some stressful situations and drama associates. Only way to get a raise or higher position brown nosing"
good,"A typical day at work would be busy, satisfying customers needs, leaving a positive impression. The hardest part of the job was during holidays. And the most enjoyable was knowing that you put a smile on your customers face."
good,"I loved every minute there, the only con i have is the pay and how you advance there ablbeit very slowly. i learned alot while i was there. the workplace culture is excellent."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. The issues experienced were always solved within an efficient timeline. The most stressful part of the job was meeting the goals management posted for us because of either under staffing or simply the lack of time to reach each goal.
good,"It is a nice place for a part time job, you definitely work for the time you are there. They have  strange work hour schedules.  I have learned a lot about retail.  I was able to move around in the store easily doing different jobs and learning new areas of the store. The people I work with are fun and everyone seems to get along well.  The hardest part of the job is standing on my feet all day."
good,Enjoyed working there good co-workers great discounts on purchasing merchandise and products.Would really like to return to work there again.Great benefits
good,A typical day at work  is you got to finish before you leave.They have there picks and chooses who they promote.You got to  beg for a day off sometimes.
good,"Overall positive environment at the location I worked at.  Good health and safety standards and a positive work atmosphere, knowledgeable leadership and training were also present while I was there."
good,The management don’t communicate with the employees on a fair face to face basis. They don’t take the advice or suggestions for a smooth going way of stocking in a timely matter. We are understaffed and not being appreciated.
good,"Flexible shifts ,different position and you  excel in the company.loved working with Walmart . seeing friendly face. Great team work and the perks of being an employee."
good,Typical day at work busy and some times very stressful but manageable if you are capable of dealing with some difficult customers or coworkers but its not a horrible place i actually enjoyed my time there
good,"I don't have any problems with Walmart, other than sometimes the little guy gets overlooked. In some cases the little guy may have the brightest idea."
good,The employees and management of Walmart was very nice and communitive. They were very helpful and friendly. Walmart is a great place to work. I would definitely recommend Walmart as a great place to work.
good,It was a relaxed but fast paced work environment. Work as a team to get job duties done. Always got to help others when getting your stuff done early and always got help if needed from others. Work was appreciated and noticed.
good,Good benefits very friendly work environment and not hard to move up in the company . Very good first job place. And you will be giving quite some hours.
good,Loved my coworkers.  The fast pace was great.  Always busy with your hands and thinking skills.  Had to be organized to work in apparel.  I learned about inventory pars and how to work with pallet jacks and cardboard strapping equipment.  Loved my job there and staying continuously busy
good,"I've been fortunate to have good managers. That isn't always the case for others I've spoken too. Walmart isn't a bad place to work but the hourly wage isn't enough for a single, adult person or a single income family. Neither is it enough for certain positions.  The work is physical, busy and expectations are generally high.  Walmart does encourage it's employees to strive for higher positions, however, it's not always possible in the store where you begin working....usually need to be open to and willing to change store location to do so. And again, pay isn't a true compensation for the work expected of lower management positions."
good,I enjoy working at the deli and bakery. I made lots of friends and met new people and had many opportunities. Management was very professional and treated me with the utmost respect.
good,"A typical day at work for me was working in the stationary department assisting customers. Working in the stationary department, I learned about the different types of fabrics."
good,It's not the most horrible place to work but customers are rude and managers can have unrealistic expectations about what you can accomplish during your shift.
good,"While I worked for the company a short time I got more training from fellow associates than my manager. She only ever talked to me when she needed something done and never liked to answer questions. It took 5 or 6 pages over the store speaker to even get her to answer, and when she did she'd never really be any help. She was also fond of paging me to clean up an area of our department while she was standing in it."
good,"Good work experience, different opportunities, good pace. Understanding management and flexible hours give it a good opportunity for education in the future."
good,"Was able to learn how to drive a stand-up forklift and hands on training"
good,"nothing to say filled prescription counseled patients gave immunizations managed store opiate stewardship basic screening for blood pressure,blood sugar  and chlosterol"
good,Every Walmart isn’t the same but the one I worked for had terrible management. I really did enjoy my job and co-workers. The customers  can also be a hastle to deal with sometimes too
good,Ok to work with but needs to pay more mind to associate needs when it comes to they job title make sure u always on time to work cuZ they can work u a lot
good,"After clocking in, check with manager to see if theirs any areas that need assisting. If not, proceed to regular assigned area or duties."
good,good company to work for needs improvement but the benefits are decent. There is a high turn over rate for managers but the employees stay committed. Good company overall.
good,"They don't give you much time to train before putting you on the floor alone. The management was usually overwhelmed because of how short staffed they always were, however they didn't have much compassion for what their employees had going on outside of work. They weren't very supportive of their employees barriers in life and are quick to dismiss employees without any sympathy or understanding of lifes curve balls a lot of their employees face."
good,I worked part time and they always worked well with my school and life schedules. Pays more than minimum wage and it’s easy as long as you work well with the public.
good,managers that I had were great people to work with and the crew that I work with were people that love to have fun and get the job done customers that I had a chance to talk with with great people and they love the work that I did
good,"Great place to work where the employees are nice and the customers are terrific.  Days are very busy and there are many applications you must learn to work with the different issues that are presented to the cashiers daily. I have learned you can never have enough of patience. The hardest part of the job is conversing with adults who do not want to speak. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my return customers who like me and I like them,  enter my line and we can talk while I add their groceries up. I usually can get them to laugh so I do make their day better.  That also makes my day better."
good,"I wasn't expecting what I went thru, you do get training on your job. But then you are required to be at a certain point which wasn't explained before I took the job."
good,"Company move out of  state I was working for Wal-Mart return center the work was steady I work on production,  the management was ok the hours was great allow me a good quality of life."
good,"Been in a lot of departments, work flow is unpredictable. Inconsistent hours, pay is good only if your getting hours.Some managers appreciate hard works most seem like they can care less."
good,was a regular job that i don't think paid that well and on top of that it was biweekly pay. but other than that the job was fine nothing out of the ordinary.
good,Fast pace and competitive with great benefits a good work hours alright management and plenty of advancement opportunity with a good work area and on hands training
good,I enjoyed meeting people from different backgrounds. I would say to have fun and embrace all of the different cultures you will meet. I personally learned from it and tried teaching myself languages from different countries.
good,"I had pneumonia, but I was a new hire, so since I took too much time off, they termed me. Typical workday was stand at your register, stock shelves while waiting, and take care of the customer."
good,Working at Wal-mart has been a good experience for me. For the most part we are allowed to work without direct supervision and are allowed to use common sense as it pertains to our daily job.
good,is a nice place to work day goes by quick getting to interact with many different faces  i look at it like a place to improve my social skills with confidence
good,"Gets very busy. "
good,"it is a great place to work fast paced you only work the days you need to work. I am able to balance school, work and my social life which Is great for me and my kids."
good,Walmart was a fair place to work. I learned new technological skills along with people skills. I learned organizational skills such as how to organize in small spaces and in a timely fashion. My manger was laid back but professional and took the time to help me learn and answer questions. Working here helped me learn time management and how to juggle life with a job.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is great. There's a lot of benefits you can get, the pay is amazing. You get bonuses 3 to 4 times a year. The management is very poor. They don't communicate with each other about certain things, they like to pick on people who don't know any better, they like to tell us about rules but have us break certain rules, and they are not helpful with important things."
good,"My primary roles included scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. I also handled returns and answered questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions."
good,"i loved working at walmart, the pay was nice and the pace was quick, if you did your work management would pretty much leave you alone only issue i had with Walmart was the management at my last Walmart job but besides that it was a really nice place to work."
good,"Fun workplace and Quick paced. As a department manager dealing with the Customers can have a bit pressure "
good,Walmart has a very good work environment. They offer many benefits as well. There are opportunities to be promoted as long as you put the effort into it.
good,"most enjoyable part of the job was servicing the customers. "
good,"Just wasn't enough hours, and besides if you didn't know somebody that worked there, then you didn't get any hours. Walmart is a good place to work, I don't approve the way they move your schedule all over the place, and besides if I could have gotten at least 38 hours."
good,A typical day is setting up the registry to service customer assisting them with finding products. I learned how to complete debit/credit card transactions transfer money and receive money. Most of the member of management were helpful and good with answering questions when you a questions. Work environment was friendly. The hardest part was not having a fixed sechudle. The most enjoyable was being able to help assist the customer and have them satisfied with your servicea.
good,"A typical day at work was order filling, i learned how to use power equipment, management tried to help but was kind of cut throat to make production, hardest part was making the high production rate."
good,Empresa buena con buen ambiente laboral estabilidad de trabajo
good,"but lazy can not be tollerated. the clicks have to stop. time to grow up people."
good,"During my time at Walmart I was on the remodel team that worked overnight, the job itself wasn't too bad the hours were hard to adjust to at first but eventually I came easier, it was a great experience to watch the transformation and to still be able to see the improvements that were made and know I was apart of it"
good,I love customer service and working at Wal-mart has been quite the journey. I enjoy my job here and would recommend working here. Management is great for the most part.
good,"Pay is good but when you figure it out by how many hours you work, not enough. Work a lot  of hours, a lot of weekends and holidays. Not a good work life balance"
good,It was okay didn't like getting paid every 2 weeks and not getting enough hours bit overall I liked working at walmart and would do it again If I could
good,"An average day well I am stocking some where's in the store help patrons and running to the front to check out shoppers. I zone all over the store pending on managements call. For the most part we have a pretty good team."
good,"C'est un travail simple et facile, mais qui peu créer beaucoup d'ennuie, car on ne nous pousse pas a ce dépasser, ce qui fait que le travail deviens très monotone."
good,A typical day at work here was stocking shelves and using a cash register.The management was good when i was there very outgoing and a great work place also a lot of work to be done. The hardest part of the job was having different hours all the time
good,"No matter the position you are placed at in at Walmart: there will always be something for you to learn and practice. There can be rushes when you are stocking, cleaning, or returning items to your department if there is a time restraint. The managers at my location were fair, respectable, patient, and generous that made it a comfortable place to be and were there for any help you might need with your area/customer. The bad thing comes with the customers who come in expecting only what they want and the managers sometimes give in no matter the company policy. Then there are the recent hour cuts that have come by after the recent raises for the year. Although there are various times where customers are very appreciative for the help you give them, even if the store didn't have what they needed. Altogether it is a tough job with ample challenges, it has it's upsides and pros when it comes to working for a super store like Walmart."
good,I liked my job but was looking for something in my technical skills that would help me to advance in my career and needed to be home with my child at a certain time
good,"O tempo que trabalhei na Empresa, ganhei bastante experiência."
good,i learned a lot since you work in all the department whenever your assistance is required. And the management sometimes offer food to the employees or they organize event.
good,"The job is relatively easy when you are properly staffed and everyone knows what they are doing. However there are days when you are short staffed and people don’t know what they are doing, and they still expect the exact same results as if you had a fully trained and staffed crew."
good,I worked with mostly young girls they liked me and i loved them we worked togeather well.We could work and have fun to.I learned to answer and operate the phone correctly .To hang clothes proper how to use the tools we needed to use this was at walmart.
good,Can be very laid back when only doing your own job but I was constantly doing other jobs outside of my job description and wasn’t getting paid the differential.
good,"Very demanding physical  and mentally ,good pay and decent benefits,management needs to work on treating people the way they wanna be treated,decent retirement"
good,"My Walmart is very customer service oriented, to the point where they will make exceptions to the return policy even when it is clear cut that helping them is technically against policy. Big on 'if you have time to lean, you have time to clean/zone', even when there's nothing in your area to clean/zone, ergo 'look busy'. Don't like excess overtime, but will accept a few minutes. Big on being safe as well and rewards lengthy safe stretches of time with food."
good,walamrt is a good place to work. This is a place that pays well as well as offers time off. THey understand that we have a family. They also offer great insurance.
good,"Walmart was a nice place to work. For the most part I enjoyed myself. Working overnight is what i mostly liked to do. stayed there for a couple years,"
good,"A typical day at work requires you to be able to move a lot and meet the needs of customers. Working the sporting goods department there would be days where you'd be siting behind the counter all day to sale guns, ammo, and fishing/hunting licenses. Then there could also be days where you'd be on your feet stocking and cleaning your department. Overall an enjoyable and comfortable work style."
good,"Hard work, Good coworker. Is a good job, fairly simple, heavy lifting. Manager are overall understanding, Supervisor makes work a lot more enjoyable and fun."
good,"Walmart is a unique job I would say, you need a general knowledge of what your working with. For if you don’t and a customer asks you about it your going to give that customer bad service and Walmart managers don’t like calls about how you don’t know your job."
good,good place to work but other employees can be inefficient.   i would still recommend it tho.   loved what i did just didn't enjoy the attitudes of others.  manger was fair at best.
good,Its great job  to start and build skill.you will learn a lot about customer service. a typical day of work is fast pace but you wont be boring. management can be stressful.
good,I will always try and find something to do. Im friendly with all the customers they prefer to come to me.  I try to work hard and stay at it. Had to make sure customers werent stealing.
good,"I enjoyed working at WalMart. I have always enjoyed being around the customers,  It is a fast paced work place and the time flies.  Would like to go back there."
good,"I always enjoyed working at the distribution center, the managers are always understanding, very good people all the way up the chain. "
good,"I enjoy working as a department manager at walmart, however some departments get paid more than mine and I just need more money than that, and too much stress makes you unhappy."
good,Walmart should focus on giving better wages and training the right people for the job. They need better mangment and be more flexible on schedules. They should also bring back the holiday pays.
good,"they don't do enough for there employees they don't allow you to get overtime, they don't hire enough people.........................................."
good,Aprendí a ser más productivo y a dirigir personal.
good,"When I started to work at Walmart in Hamilton I had a wondering manager and the job, even though it was only a minimum wage, it was actually pretty fun. Of course, I did get told off when I did something wrong, but I never got told off for anything that was out of my control. My manager was understanding of my personal life and treated me with great care. Though sadly half a year later he transferred to a different city and my co-workers and I (the cashiers) got a new manager. The job didn't turn bad, but it certainly was not near as good. Overall, Walmart is an okay place to work. Depending on the manager currently working there it can be just okay, or with the right management, it can be a great job."
good,The workplace was slow at times and then in the blink of an eye it was hectic due to holidays. I handle stress well but the complaints of others around a person that cannot may sway them to join in with the complaining or break down. I liked the hours and i also assisted in the recovery after hurricane harvey by showing up in the daytimes as an overnight worker pulling double shifts.
good,"A typical day as a Freight handler begins with, doing morning warm-up stretches and receiving the safety report from the previous shift/day. It is a fast pace job, and can be physically demanding, but the team and associates are very friendly and helpful to new hires."
good,its a good place to work at but the management needs some work to do. the management usually go after favoritism and will make other feel unwelcome in the work place.
good,Night managers are hands on help us with everything everyone is cool everything goes well just a very good environment to work good with everything goes great
good,"Uma empresa multinacional que investe e apoia o crescimento dos funcionários, em 6 meses me tornei encarregada de loja.  A política da empresa a avaliação e dá subsídios para o crescimento, a cultura da empresa nos deixa a vontade para opinar."
good,Excelente empresa para laborar cuenta con un buen clima
good,A good day until the other shift doesn't do there job or finish what they started. Learned how to be responsible and have a positive attitude and how to think ahead. Management sometime doesn't know what they doing and they can be very disrespectful at times. The workplace culture is very laid back and relaxing. The hard part of the job is when you have a lot of tasks to complete at once. The enjoyable part is when you get off or pay day.
good,"Varied duties to keep busy. I learned cashiering and sales duties."
good,Walmart is a good job they  my day consists of putting inventory tags on merchandise and put in inventory racks to work through backstop in in the back room
good,"The company is very positive and went through a lot of changes since their previous years, I loved the company till I had to deal with poor management when it comes to a required partner for my position, which I had to deal with a 2 person job by myself, taking all the blame and ending up with a manager that did not like me ""Wal-Mart is full of so many different type of people and unfortunately I ended up with a really bad one at the end"" overall I was forced to leave the company due to problems with management. I still think is a good place to work if you don't have to deal with that type of people that can turn the peaceful environment into something hostile."
good,"There's a lot of great aspects about Walmart, but a lot of not so great ones as well. But that's any job. "
good,walmart is a busy company being an unloader was a a very busy job always except for when the truck was late sometimes my favorite about the job was lunch and every second week to be honest this is true nobody doesnt like not getting paid unless your volunteering to help
good,"There are processes to be followed with company guidelines."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in, a brief team meeting, unload the trucks, sort merchandise by department, unwrap and hang apearal, stock, clean, etc. I learned team building, self respect, rapid movement, etc. The hardest part of this job was the rules they had being changed everyday, the customers, the space available to work, etc. The most enjoyable part was the customers, meeting new co-workers, the pay, etc."
good,"Walmart has been my favorite job so far. It has its days like any other job, but as far as overnights, its pretty relaxed but on holidays expect to work almost 12 hour shifts and not be able to call out. This job helps me stay on my feet and pay for my college too. Management can do better, and they will write you up for stupid stuff if you dont perform like a superhero they think you are, but you have to learn to step your ground and stick up for yourself and they will back off eventually! I love my job though! My cowokers are funny and are the reason I show up everyday! <3"
good,Management plays favorites. plain and simple. Not everyone is granted the same leeway. Not everyone gets built up the same. It's a popularity contest.
good,"A lot of great associates, Management is high off making goal and bonuses. General Manager doesn't care about work culture. Pay is good, benefits are good, hard to advance unless you are buddy buddy with manager. Great place to work if you keep to yourself and get the job done."
good,"The main office seems to think they know what is going on, but when it comes to the supervisors and workers they don't really care. They will keep trying to lower your amount of time to be faster and faster every single week and pushing it passed the extreme. If it takes 1 hour (This is in the Wal-Mart policy) to unload 1000 pieces from a truck, they will keep lowering that number while the policy stays the same, and you will get written up for going any slower. Same with unloading merchandise to the floor for customers. If someone got it done in faster time, you now will too or you will be written up."
good,It was a typical day at work with great people. It was always a good place to go and have a peaceful place to work because everyone had the same mindset. Get the job done.
good,"great environment,good team effort,cant wait to return."
good,"I loved working for Walmart but my manager didn’t like me. I worked part time every Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday evening. I asked for a Saturday off she told me no to get my priorities straight. So I gave my notice and moved on.  This from someone who only worked days and Monday through Friday"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me coming in after the overnight crew and gathering the products of theirs left on the floor. These products either could not fit, are on an incap display around the store, or we just happen to not have that specific item in our upc database.  I would do is gather all materials and decide which category to bin these items in. after I binned the remaining items in, I was to go back on the floor and scan all of the shelf openings(shelves with out of stock items) and report back to find all of those materials. I would do this Hr in and Hr out. A self governing job that required my own judgement in order to fulfill what was needed"
good,"the daily use of a TC70 and MC40 leaves you with a memory reflex if other jobs have these in use. i used them both daily from stocking to price label changes and more. management is like anywhere else, the store i worked at we looked out for each other. honestly some customers could be really annoying. when a customer comes to me looking for help and i was able to help them with anything they might of had trouble with."
good,It defiantly was a different experience for me a-lot of work to do in not enough time but tend to find happiness in the job; sometimes management was helpful but most time management couldn't give clear instructions. overall its not a bad start up job.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work with. Can become very stressful at times when peak hours hit and there are lines filled with customers but when the managers are on it, the lines go down pretty quick. A typical day for me as a cashier was zoning the front end, making sure the floors are clean as well as the the surrounding area of the cash registers."
good,Esta muy bien organizada y me gusta su administración del tiempo a los trabajadores y el ambiente laboral es bueno.
good,I really enjoyed working a Walmart.  There was always some type of task going on so you never got bored. I worked in electronics so you had to be knowledgeable about the products.  That made it fun to work with the customers.  I had to leave because of an illness in my family.  I hated to leave but would love to go back.
good,"Work is everything if you work for Wal-Mart. You must have the desire to work, because you are a dime a dozen. You will meet some of the greatest people while working for this company, but don't assume becoming any kind of manager is easy."
good,"Working at Walmart is demanding at times with the managers complaining more than complementing you on your work, but they have great health benefits and events for the employees. I would recommend it as a great place to work at."
good,"Otima empresa, atende bem seus funcionarios e clientes."
good,"Everybody at Walmart.com means well and is interested in your personal life. There is a sense of community and caring that is unique to the Walmart culture. The company does a great job of being an inclusive environment and provides means for you to get the most out of your time there. With that said, Walmart has a ton of bureaucracy that weighs you down in the same position for long periods of time without many opportunities for advancement. It comes with the job, but if you work hard and prove yourself an asset to the company, then there is plenty of room for growth."
good,"It’s very enjoyable to be around a big diversity of different cultures, I am overly pleased with the outcome, I love trying to strive for a better me by myself or with friends and family."
good,Walmart was an overall pretty decent place to work. The customers aren't horrible. The staff is mostly like family and you get to know and love your coworkers. The only reason I dont work there anymore is due to one of the supervisors and she doesnt even work there anymore either.
good,The workplace wasn't really stressful at all. I just stocked shelves. The manager was usually always fair and decent. Don't really have anything bad to say about the management.
good,"Overall Walmart was a good working experience. Same as with all companies, Walmart was constantly changing and reinventing themselves. A very fast paced environment. Often times as a manager we worked a lot of extra hours mandated through the upper management that was not helpful to the work life balance. Which was really the hardest part. I truly enjoyed the family culture of Walmart. I loved getting to know our customers and the employees."
good,some coworkers were really cool and friendly  i enjoyed working there because it was always busy gives you something to do at all times the manment were really friendly and understanding
good,"A job that you can make a career out of if you are motivated and it's something that you are interested in.  However, positions, even for management are not secure."
good,The friends I made at Walmart made the job bearable. Working produce is pretty standard. The most difficult part of the job are the customers but that's for all of retail.
good,I worked overnights for Walmart in a 5 year span. I worked my way up from Stocker to Overnight Support Manager. The pay raise was decent but still not enough for the amount of work that is requested from the overnight managers above you. The job was stressful with trying to balance managing your team on employees as well as doing nightly tasks given to your by the upper management team. The managers I worked with were nice and great at what they did. The most enjoyable part about my job was that I worked 4 on and 3 off.
good,management is great and if you want any changes met you will have to reach out to management. People coming in your line for checkout makes your day or can break it but i put a positive spin on it and you can't imagine the turn around their attitude has.
good,"As a manager, I had a rotating schedule, which was good. Had to work overnight every other year, which was not so good for me. For the most part, the store mgrs. were good. My last one being the exception. There is a lot of employee turnover. Recently, they've gotten to where they want to get rid of the long-term employees who make more money, and hire part time employees. That's why they never have enough coverage anymore."
good,"When I started things were a little difficult, but after a day or so you can usually get the hang of things. You usually end up working in one section of the store so if you don't like repetitive work you may get bored."
good,I liked working here - there was variety and the store was busy. It was hard to get hours sometimes but for the most part it was a great place to work
good,The best part of the job was unloading freight and restocking the pet aisle. Lunch breaks were split for my position for either an early lunch or a later lunch.
good,"Its a very demaining place. You will get grade in what you do. The other associate are rude and very abusive including the managers. Do you like to be call stupid or dumb? Well, if you do this is a place for you."
good,"Cool, clean and steady place of work. Management didnt really mingle with me but i kind of liked that. Great benefits and bonuses. Would definitely work there again"
good,la experiencia que te aportan las personas que laboran en la empresa en muy util para tu desrrollo profesional y personal
good,I.loved the.people I.worked.with.but.there's so any csm trying to be.the boss...n everyone stress out it was.so.bad.the.Point system is very confusing you.r told.one thing n it's another.thing.but.I love.my.customers that came.in there.regularly
good,"I loved working for the company. It was fun getting to interact with so many different people. It was a great opportunity getting to learn how everything worked and being able to grow as a person. The only thing i didnt like was it feeling like high school again. Its supposed to be a team, not be teamed up on."
good,"It is a good place to start and get your name out but it's not a career for me. I love the outdoors, was raised on a farm. Putting me in there was not the greatest. But I pushed through it. I would go be there if i had to ."
good,I have very much enjoyed working there and had I not had brain surgery causing me to have to work from home I would still be there. There were many good years there
good,They are very flexible with your schedule and are willing to work with you if anything comes up. Managements usually very easy to talk to if you have any questions or concerns.
good,Great management and staff to work with. The schedules are flexible and management works with you in accomodating you.  The work place culture is great so as long as you are doing the work assigned.
good,"In my time working there I had decent hours, pay and a great time with customers. Honestly if I could work there again it would be amazing.  The people that I worked with and the friends I made was great. I learned my cashier skills from this place and the hardest was trying to break the threshold of having more hours."
good,As a temporary remodel crew member it would be difficult at times with lifting and working night shifts. But overall it was a good environment to be in.
good,Good to work  good job good job good nice ok people hood job nice people to work for good job good environment  good environment good environment good environment.
good,Deixa a desejar que existem muitos profissionais que denigrem a empresa..
good,I spent 11 years at the distribution center. We worked long hard hours lifting heavy boxes in cold temperatures.The pay is good but the hours are long. The work is stressful.
good,"Easy job, hours were inconsistent.  Never knew how many hours you would get from one week to next.   Time off was hard to get.  Not very flexible, when it comes to family matters."
good,"good, was not what i wanted to do with the rest of my life and i thank them for giving me a oppurtunity to work for them and forever will be gracious of them"
good,I loved everything about Walmart. The other employees were amazing and the managers were very understanding to any need that anyone had. I will always recommend Walmart to anyone who asks.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno. Lo que no me gusta y quiero avisar/advertir a quienes desean entrar, es que es una empresa que busca mucho ahorrar en sus presupuestos, por lo cual uno puede pasar meses a la espera de que se complete la plantilla a la cual pertenece. Muchas veces un solo empleado deberá ejecutar y rendir lo mismo que dos empleados, se da más que nada en carnes y pescados, donde la misma persona suele atender ambos lugares sin ningún tipo de compensación ni aumento salarial ni nada por el estilo. Llegará el momento en que debas cerrar solo tu departamento/área y dividirte en tres para poder sacar el trabajo adelante. En mi área, hay ocasiones en que debo atender al cliente, recibir mercancía y ejecutar el cierre de mi departamento a la vez. No esperes agradecimiento por un buen trabajo, mucho menos un aumento salarial."
good,"I've been there for 4 yrs it was a great job, great benefits , management was always miss communicating, or very unprofessional at sometimes, hardest part was being rushed and having unrealistic expectation"
good,Worked in the cash office and balanced cash drawers for previous day sales. Co-workers were great. I worked part time as a cashier and loved talking to the customers. Cash office was a lot better for me so I could of keep my accounting skills fresh.
good,Being at Walmart has been similar to working at Target.  You could be there for 20 years or barely last 20 days.  A lot depends at what job you are doing.  In my case Cap Team 1 since I was hired has undergone a lot of changes.  I don't happen to agree or like those changes so decided to look for employment elsewhere.  In the end Walmart stores are good opportunities especially for young people in their 20's.  But it's not always for everyone coming down to 20 years or 20 days...
good,I had worked at Walmart for three years and loved every minute of my job. It's like having one big family and a home away from home. It can be stressful at times but I still loved it.
good,I liked working with the customers and restocking and unloading sometimes but I just didn’t like they had me everywhere. I had every position basically.i really wasn’t in a stable work place
good,"It can be a great place to work, some the best co-workers EVER. Some jobs our fun and fast placed,"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading and sorting , trucks positively interacting with customers and helping to make their shop experience successful and enjoyable, stocking products, cleaning up workplace and organize product meanwhile helping any co-workers who needed it. In the two years of my experience of working at walmart I've learned how to have better customer service skills and better my working abilities ; the culture was receiving. The management made sure we stayed on track and work and got as much work in the workplace done as possible while being efficient and diligent.The hardest most enjoyable part of the job was knowing just by being helpful and cordial to a guest and seeing their attitude completely change because it was more than what they were expecting and the hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks."
good,"working at walmart as a cashier is always fast paced. Customers expect you to be fast and error free and bag their items accordingly and they also expect for you to give them free things. its a lot to tolerate and the environment is  mostly stressful on busy days.. other than that its very east work, and times always goes fast while working hard and doing your job."
good,"I would say that being a cashier is an easy job, i would be lying and telling the truth. While it may seem simple, on some days the overall work a cashier does is demanding and stressful. would i recommend it for everyone. No. But it is a decent job and you need little training to do so."
good,Working at Walmart is a good job. But I’m looking for a career and not really sure I want to move up there. The people are generally good natured. The pay is decent but not for the area I live in.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. Great team members and staff. I would’ve loved to stay but I got an job offer that I thought would help me grow and expanded learning.
good,It is an okay place to work. Someone the managers where great managers and some didnt care about how hard they worked their employees. They were flexiable with the hours i needed to work.
good,"Working for this company has taught me so much about customer service, customer satisfaction and the ins and outs of how to make a days at work beneficial not for myself but others around me as well. The hardest part of my job was learning to understand that not everyone can be satisfied instead trying to make your best ability to make a solution suitable for both parties. I enjoyed learning different cultures, others point of view on situations and learning how to better my work ethics."
good,"I work overnight so it's a lot more laid back. Managers are nice but could put more effort in solving some problems. The pace for work can be slow or fast depending on freight for the night. I haven't worked there long enough so for those who have worked here longer might have a stronger opinion or experience. Overall, I enjoy working here temporarily."
good,It was okay you have to keep moving stay busy  help your co worker respect the customer alway smile and be polite over all a great experience pay it ok
good,"if you work well with the public this is the place for you. fast paced environment  with management that knows how to make the work fun. everyone works as a team, they even have fun meetings, holiday parties and an associate discount."
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,Good place for an introduction to team culture and social interaction skills. A typical day will have you interacting with customers from all walks of life.
good,"My review on Walmart was pretty good. I never worked retail before, so I'm glad to have gained experience in a different work field. A few managers I did not agree with, but we live and we learn."
good,Nice place to work. You become like a family and everyone helps each other out. People are always there to help out with tasks and questions. Friendly even paced place to work.
good,"The recent push on the technology front at Wal-mart is a great start for the company, but it still has a long way to go. The company as a whole needs to get out of the mindset of using legacy applications and infrastructure. They need to understand that in order to grow, money must be spent and trying to do things the cheapest way possible isn't going to lead to the kind of growth that they need."
good,"Good place to work. Very family oriented. They make you feel welcomed and you can easily buy into the Sam Walton belief system that the customer is always right,"
good,Walmart is actually a great place to work to learn all aspects of retail.  I unloaded trucks for a time then moved to stocking. There are deadlines to get tasks done but if you fall behind managers will try to get help for you rather than issue punitive actions.  Stay away from the gossip and politics as that can be troublesome.  The pay is low but I appreciated being employed and wanted to do my best.  Good job for students as they work with your schedules.
good,"While walmart does offer significant benefits, the pay isn't enough to keep a decent living. I worked with a lit of great people that didnt get the recognition they deserve and those whonslacked seemed to move up faster."
good,Great place to work for. Had lots of fun working there made lots of friends that I still have today. When I was there as a Department Manager I was able to run my dept. like I wanted to. I had customers that would come in and ask me to order a big amount of products for them. I would get them in and they would be so pleased. Thanking me for the great job.
good,I really enjoyed working for the company.  I worked 18 years there. Would I work for the company again? Yes I would. So hopefully I can get re hired at Kalispell Montana Walmart. Thank you.
good,Their is room for advancement. It can also be cutthroat. Walmart has good benefits. The pay raises are not that good. It could be a lot better. The coworkers some of them could be envious at times.
good,"a typical day at work is fun an exciting, what i learned from Walmart is that everybody is different you will have your good days just as well as bad but if your good out weighs your bad your good, Some of the managers are supportive just know who is for you an in your circle, the hardest part of my job was to take lunch i was always on the go wanted to work, the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers helping them out."
good,It was a great experience the benefits was pretty decent. Working in Georgetown we were more like family and everybody was caring of each other.  Each day I looked forward to going to work but the distance was too far for me and it was costing me more to travel back and forth.
good,"Fun environment , never had a problem with management. Most managers are down to earth. Salary is set up weird raises are given to certain people and other not so often"
good,Walmart is a great job if you can stand sometimes lousy managers and always lousy customers. The pay isn't bad and the benefits are awesome. They are always hiring managers and it isn't impossible for someone to move up if they apply themselves. The only real downside is that you'll be working at walmart. If you can get over that then it's great.
good,Beginning at Wal-mart may seem overwhelming but it quickly becomes routine. The team members that work well with one another make it a very relaxed place to work. Is a great job for first time workers.
good,my typical day at work was busy.i leared not to miss days of work and how to work with others.management was pretty great.the workplace culture is very bigthe hardest part of my job was meeting quota i most enjoyed working with customers
good,A nice and simple job. At times you deal with customers but for the most part your making the store look it’s bedt. Its a fun place and the people are nice
good,They are usually understanding of your situation but you might get I see us and more someone who doesn't like you. They are really flexible with your time.
good,It is a great company to start at an entry level and can even turn into a career because they love long term employees and helping them advance. The management where I was located was great and helped me solve problems that I had to face instead of pushing them under the rug.
good,I've worked for walmart several times at different locations. depending on your store and your department decides your experience. typically understaffed but they make up for it in great benefits and decent pay
good,The company always strive to be the best in the market provide the best service provider best working please save this possible attempt to  competitive salary rate employee activities and community involvement in social work andn action cross training opportunities move within the store various departments learning opportunities
good,"A typical day  was very fast paced with several different jobs, you had to clean, and stock, and check people out in a timely manner.  I learned that having a smile on your face can help anyone's day. Management was very strong and tight, and the rules were to be followed exactly (like most places of course as it should be.) The hardest part of the job was trying to fix a problem that a customer had while they were being rude. The best part of the job was working with all the polite people who would talk to you and always remained very polite."
good,Walmart is a fun and loving place to work. I enjoyed every single day that I worked there. The people are very high spirit at times and always get along with other there. Walmart is one of my favorite jobs I every had.
good,Walmart has been a great career so far just want to continue to grow as an individual and feel like a change in career would benefit me. Walmart was a great stepping stone for my life.
good,"I enjoyed working upfront at Walmart. But the pharmacy section was the absolute worse. On the busy days which was the weekend, it was only a limited amount of workers. We didn't work as a team. And it was always friction in that small tiny space between different coworkers. Which made it very difficult for us want to work in those type of conditions."
good,"Walmart was a fun, team oriented, friendly atmosphere, They were helpful in my first few weeks there, made me feel apart of the family, i was unloading/loading truck and also organizing the products in stock."
good,The pay is not a lot as it pays every 2 weeks. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for 8 hours. At night its mostly adults there but some high school kids who do not understand what they signed up for.
good,"It's not easy, but it pays well. Wish I could've stayed, but was living too far from the workplace. The managment at this location could have been more helpful and accomadating but feel like working with my mother in the same department caused others to view it as my benefit and that my mother would have my back. The team leader was not helpful in teaching me the proper way to work when I was hired. I did not let this deter me, but it came down to the fact I could not make the distance and should have worked at my local Wal-Mart."
good,"Es una empresa que no hace diferencias y tiene muy buenas reglas a cumplir, tiene buen ambiente laboral."
good,"it was go place to be at you pay was good you only worked three days if you were third shift, it was a fast pace place so you had to be ready when the box's came down your line."
good,"O dia era corrido muitos clientes,aprendi as funçoes do caixa lidar com dinheiro e os clientes.A gerencia observava e criticava e pouco dava soluçao aos problemas.Ambiente otimo e colegas maravilhosos.O mais dificil era lidar com clientes que reclamavan. Horario do intervalo era bem agradavel."
good,"Mehor capacitación para sus asocidos, sobre odo necesita  mas interes en sus lideres como ppr ejemplo en su aubgerencia yennla vida personal de sus asociados"
good,Since I worked as a Backroom Team Member I had the same routine and schedule everyday for 5-6 days straight which can old real quick and too many call outs which affected the team as a whole
good,"Typical work day consisted of me to clock in, gather orders from management of what is expected to do on a daily basis. Update pricing, check for stolen items, products or department evenly zoned, and most importantly customers were taken care of immediately."
good,"My time spent at Walmart was positive with the many connections I had each day with customers, associates and management. Although I did my daily goals I also enjoyed some new routines that would come my way. The only issue was the lack of associates needed on a given day."
good,Wal-Mart was a big help when starting my family unfortunately I couldn't stay the times they had available for me to work where not going to work having a new born baby I would try again being as though my daughter is now in school and I have more free time .
good,"i worked at Walmart for almost 2 years, management only pointed out the bad, no matter how hard you try, its always the bad. management communication is terrible. i feel like it could be a really great job if they change out management..."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Walmart. Management was fair and worked effortlessly with everyone, my only complaint is working on holidays. I would rather spend that time making memories with my family."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work at if your looking for good, steady paychecks.  Its not the place for you if u are not friendly , i am a talkative , person who likes to work with others and communicate with customers so its a easy , decent job for me ."
good,"Got along with everybody there. It was sometimes fun with my co workers. Some managers were cool, some weren't. There was sometimes goals that we had that we couldn't meet and would have to stay over the time we were suppose to leave. Short breaks."
good,"The store was very busy every day and it was extremely fast paced throughout the whole day. It made the time go by faster, but at times there were a lot of impatient customers."
good,I like working there but got tired of being schedule 2-11 every weekend even though the department I worked in closed at 9pm. I had to work the morning shift due to school.
good,"Gostei muito de laborar na empresa pelo fato dos colaboradores de cargo superior fazer com que o ambiente, seja agradável."
good,I would recommend it to someone but not as a career just till u find something better simple because it seems really hard to advance in this company Walmart
good,as long as you don't miss too many days of work you know you have a job. and make sure to communicate well with your managers. good communication equals a good experience
good,"fast-paced environment.  learned about the flow of inventory and how to control it as well as how to mitigate shrink.  led by example with my subordinates when implementing new processes and following old and new processes.  coworkers are friendly, teamwork is decent.  difficult to retain associates for long periods of time.  great to meet new associates and customers."
good,Great team work.Flexible hours.The hardest part was driving to and from my job due to it being in another town.Managers were easy to talk to and very approachable.
good,"The job was decent. We had a lot of interaction with the corporate office due to close proximity. It was not the greatest job, but it wasn't bad either. It paid a decent wage once you made department manager, but the lower positions were difficult to live at."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for overall. It has its few cons but every job has them. It gets the bills paid and I live comfortably. Management at all stores are different. I had great ones and bad ones. Socially wise though its always the same to me. It never changes. Stay to yourself and work and stay friendly. Its the walmart culture.
good,En la hora de la merienda ofrecian gaseosas y alfajores muy buena atencion.
good,"There is a turnover rate getting in is easy getting to were you want to be is, ... well I'm still trying to get to a place were I can work up to were I want to be."
good,I really loved working at Walmart. I learned a lot about apparel but I had to leave because of family matter and work was really far from where I was at.
good,"nice pay but you do have to work for it, long hours, not enough breaks, people need more than 2 20 minute breaks on 12+ hour shifts, nice restrooms compared to other warehouses however the staff constantly destroys them, bad morale coming from temporary staff, truly believe culture would be better through out without the use of contracted employees, bonuses could never be met to any amount due to temporary staff for the most part not doing their share simply cause they didn't receive the Walmart bonus so why work for it. some changes definitely need to take place however, over all decent place to make a living compared to other things you could be doing. they definitely give your raises when they say, first place ive ever known to actually do that. In the end I would recommend Walmart."
good,It has it's hard days but overall a good place to work! Most of the bosses will help you out anyway they can. I moved to csm after only a few weeks. A great place if your a people person.
good,"As with any job, it all depends on the people that you work with. If you are surrounded by great people that do a good job then your day will be better even if you have to deal with difficult customers."
good,The management were great people overall. The pay was alright. My coworkers were great overall. My position I worked was not too bad. The total work environment was great.
good,I love working for Walmart 19 years of the same company does mean a lot it had its perks and some stuff that wasn't the best but all in all the company in the store has been great to me without Walmart I would not be the person I am today
good,Solo darle más énfasis a sus encargados de local que al pasar el tiempo se vuelven ya psicólogos...
good,"I loved working at walmart, but the store i worked had bad case of playing favorites and forming social cliches. Trying to get anywhere in Walmart if you were not apart of the cliche no matter how well you were rated in your job was almost impossible.  Best part of the job was people i met and worked with, they mad high paced stress filled job fun to work."
good,I enjoyed working here as a pharmacy technician and it was a great stepping stone for me to advance in my career. I learned many pharmacy skills set to help me become a pharmacist.
good,Greeting and working with customers.  Ringing up customers. Keeping the area near and clean. Maintaining the register and aisle. Giving correct change and helping load groceries in basket
good,"Fun work place; some of the duties can be hard laboring, but its rewarding knowing you are able to help the company survive. your able to learn multiple different departments to well round your knowledge on different aspects of any job there."
good,"I just took each box of product and checked to see if it could be placed on the shelf. If there was no room for it at that time, I would place an inventory label on the box and place it in the back room in our area. I helped customers find what they were looking for and always had a smile for them. I enjoyed my manager directly over me. "
good,"Great place to work. You meet a lot of  awesome people..  Morning and Night shifts have the best hours."
good,"a typical day at work was good, i learned a lot about sales. management was OK, workplace culture was great. the hardest was dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers."
good,"Hours are great, it's a busy environment, self check out it's the best thing that could have happened, keeps you busy, meet a lot of different people, hardest partnis keep in your cool with difficult customers,"
good,As an automotive technician and a bay supervisor I deal with various types of customers. My Assistant Manager ACC is very supportive of the people who work under her. The hardest part of the job is being short handed and dealing with angry customers.
good,"Hard work, the harder you work more is expected of you.  Many days difficult to get done what is expected of you as your normal routine as well as what ever management decides that you should do as well."
good,Do not believe everything you hear about this company- they were and are a great organization. I truly miss working for them. They do support career growth and diversity.
good,Some days are more busier than others when you have enough staffing.  At times they do not schedule enough coverage to perform job effectively. It's a good way to meet new people and know that at times I can make their day brighter.
good,en cedis son muy estrictos pero si un poco lentos e y no tienen un orden en el proceso de descargas
good,I liked working in lawn and garden. I liked that i could move around and assist customers with their needs whether that included helping them find items or assisting in helping them load items.
good,"At Walmart it doesn't matter what department you work in you will learn other departments, which does take away from your department and your department manger will be upset but will understand, You only get paid for working your department unfortunately,. Management is decent until you get to the assistant managers, some of them can be stuck up and some can be super friendly, some are helpful and some are not."
good,"Worked night shift, 2-10 pm. Work schedule always included weekends which was difficult sometimes when events came up and was unable to attend. Not much leeway for time off being part time. Work atmosphere was good, but sometimes hectic on inventory arrival days,"
good,"Walmart is competitive, they treat everyone very equally and they have standards.  It can be hard work but the pay and benefits are worth it for most people. I don’t regret working there. You can also establish many friendships at this place."
good,"Walmart is a fast-paced workplace. You will learn a lot every day. Communication and customer service is great to have in this business. Management is okay to work with, some are able to work with you and some are not. I enjoy meeting and having the great conversation with new people. I always have the same people that come through my line to speak to me and want me to check them out."
good,I had a nice time working there just it was very stressful and hard to keep up with things sometimes. Some days it was hard but some days it was fairly simple and fun to work there.
good,"Wal-mart is a really good place to start if you're looking for a good paying job to start out with. The managers I have at my store are good, and they are willing to help or try to help with the situation."
good,Walmart is a great place to work the people are what makes the company I hate to leave as they make you feel like a part of the family but it's my very first job and I think it's time for a change in environment to branch out and take on a new challenge. Walmart has taught me so much .
good,"No paid holidays, write ups if you take off for the holidays, part time hours, favoritism, and no cafe. Career advancement is only given by seniority and not by performance"
good,a typical day at work here consist of making sure all customers are being helped and leave with what they walked in needing.Making sure the store stays organized and clean for easy access for customers.
good,Its the largest retail employer with lots of employment opportunities at the lower levels. Once you get to the management then its pick and choose basis. . Good perks and lots of compensations and benefits to work there. Very relaxed dress code and advancement opportunities.Its a good career oriented company.
good,Working at Walmart was very fast paced. For me personally working at a fast pace work environment is a challege.  I also interacted with customers on a daily basis which i love.
good,Walmart is consistently revolving in their policies and products. It is a great company to work for! I feel that there are too many turnovers in management at my store. The present scheduling system does not schedule enough associates for sufficient coverage of all service areas of the store.
good,"As a person wkth IBS, I found it difficult to work the hours I was given. Their disabilty company didn't let me join because I only had worked there for three (3) months. Thier minimum was six (6)."
good,They'll give you the hours that you ask for. Decent benefits. Not a bad company to work for at all. Depends on what department you are in also........
good,"If you work hard and are not submissive, you can do well.  Most important is to question actions in a professional manner in front of one or more witnesses.  Some salaried managers are excellent leaders.  Others, not so much.  "
good,I enjoyed the mix between slow and fast pace working. I also enjoyed working with the customers. I feel they should improve their training program and the flexibility with the hours and point system.  Overall it is a nice company to work for.
good,I've worked at Walmart for two years now and in many different departments through out the store. I think the job is great and the people I work with are wonderful. Some times the job it self can be stressful with customers and some tasks. The management team are always there willing to listen they truly do have a open door policy. Im just ready to move on to a different job and have a new experience!
good,"Was constantly busy, given daily and weekly tasks to complete. Not always given enough resources to complete assigned tasks. The company works to create a team environment."
good,"WalMart provides you with a break room, which has a refrigerator and microwaves which is convenient. There is also a place out front for employees to smoke which is nice, but over I feel like there could be more benefits for employees there considering the workload that is put on them."
good,"Buen lugar para aprender y desarrollarse."
good,My job is very fast-paced and I only have a certain amount of time to complete each task assigned to me each shift. I enjoy meeting new people and assisting customers when they need help and working with my co-workers.
good,"Walmart has a great work culture. A typical day would last 7-8 hours with 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch. At Walmart you do a lot of standing and that is hard on the back. They definitely compensate with the amount of break time you are allowed. My favorite thing was ""open-door"" policy. I sometimes utilize that now even though the company may not have it? That is all!!! Thank You."
good,working in the backroom doing inventory and sending out product to be put out on shelves. also if necessary help customers find what they need and get they want
good,"Very great job, just wish there was not a 6 month wait period to apply again. Loved working here, great people all around, and very flexible schedule!"
good,Nothing bad to say about Walmart I enjoy working there just want to be paid more for what I do. Got a family of 5 to feed so just trying to make more money and have a chance to work over 40 hrs to provide for them.
good,"Hambiente Divertido, con sueldos bajos todos los dias ja ja , un nivel de estres bastante cargado."
good,I enjoyed coming to work everyday and being apart of the team because everyone is nice and friendly and got along. That's one of the best things about work.
good,I worked for Wal-Mart over 4years had no problems everyone treated me nice. Left because I needed more money and benefits!The company was good for me it was pastime work and the location was great from my house. Wal-Mart is a place to make ends meet or extra money not a career unless you on the management team.
good,"Multiple opportunity to move up within the company, requests for days off usually met, plenty learning opportunities, joyful work place, fast paced and time management"
good,You had your help . You had your costumers who put smiles on your face . Just to have the challenges everyday to over come your work ethics. Get to know others personalities you work with everyday
good,"Good starting pay"
good,Wal-Mart's a great place to work and have some of the best associates. The Work environment is calm and the breaks are okay. The only thing I would say is management needs work
good,The jobs available you can advance at in approximately 2 years time if there is openings. Sometimes job advancement openings are relocation to other stores. The training programs are thorough and up to date. The start up pay for most jobs there are very low. Second jobs are necessary if this is your one full-time job.The co-workers are very positive and wants to help others.
good,Loved working at Walmart. Many advancement opportunities. People are great to work with and hours are flexible. Quarterly bonuses are a plus. Nice comfortable working environment
good,"Walmart now starts at $11/hr and they have flexible hrs. The management is great. The only thing that I think is kind of bad is that you can only get 4 points (you get 1 point for calling in a day, half a point for being more than 9 minutes late, and 4 points for a no call no show) within your 1st 6 months before being let go, this means if you get sick or have occasional migraines that are so bad you can't leave your bed (as I do) you're pretty much screwed, otherwise though it is a great place to work and if you make it the first six months you can then get up to 9 points before being let go."
good,Was ok at times. But most days it was competitive and fast pace. There is always something to do. I love the people. I love working with my associates
good,"Overall, it wasn't a terrible job. The hours were great, the pay was adequate, and the coworkers were, on the whole, relatively friendly. I can say that I much preferred working on the day shift than I did working on the overnight shift. My only real gripe is that some of the supervisors didn't have an ideal management style."
good,"A very interesting  and productive company to work for to experience a high level of customer service  duties and responsibilities on a daily basis . Moreover, Walmart  is a workplace where associates can  improve themselves by gaining new skills and develop interpersonal aptitudes with others. Working at Walmart makes you feel as a part of a big family where the "" Sam Walton"" culture is shared by all."
good,"we had to team up to unload trucks , separate inventory for each apartment , prepping the over stock and putting it up on top of the shelves , pallet jack and forklift licensed"
good,Walmart is alright depending on how you look at it. Department manager was great but midlevel above her were not the most professional or nicest of people.
good,I like working for walmart it's a fun place to work. The associated are friendly and willing to help out when needed. The management team is available when needed.
good,Walmart is a good place to work for but they need to train people better for their positions .  They also need to allow the employees to work over time when they are short handed. I have all ways volunteered  to work over when we are short handed but they wouldn't let me. I always say give the overtime to the ones that are good worker and the heck with the slackers.
good,i loved the pay the hours and the layed back nature of the store there are so many other employees and regular customers you pretty much just organize aisles the whole time
good,Not a bad company to work for. They will work with the schedule that you need and will assist in rescheduling due to appointments. Customer Service does need improvement.
good,"I worked in sales.  In the Mens department and Womens and customer service. I met a lot of people. I did recovery of the departments, Helped people with returns and organized carts for employees to take to their departments to return items. I merchandised. I put clothing outfits together for the departments displays and helped customers in the fitting rooms. "
good,"I loved my job with Walmart Stores Incorporated until I ended up being forced onto the Overnight Shift.  I enjoy being a Walmart Manager, for sure, but am struggling to deal with the schedule that the company is asking me to work."
good,Expectations are high if associates show aptitude. Fast paced and often needing more staff at this location. Associates are friendly and make the environment workable.
good,"Was definitely a decent place to work. Most of the employees were easy going. Some managers were pretty chill. Some, not so much. It was nothing more than a job. Nothing special."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a life time experience "
good,I have enjoyed working at Walmart. of course with any job there are ups and downs. The Pharmacy has been through numerous Pharmacy Managers and Techs.
good,Liked the department manger. Upper management could be more desired. Easy to work with the co workers.  I think the pay is good but should be based on performance not an average of overall store operations.
good,Great work environment with motivated and enthusiastic employees. Supervisors are helpful and do no micromanage. Company his great with trying to accommodate availability.
good,"not a bad job .good and bad days like all others , have to stay positive and do your best. most associates are helpful and friendly , somedays stressful at busy times and other times not so bad."
good,My job was time consuming and fast paced yet customer satisfaction always. We had to work quickly before the store opened to get all freight on the flo
good,They give you 10% off when you've worked for 90 days. Most of management is understanding and considerate. There are some great associates. Holidays are busy but rewarding.
good,Cashier at night.Learned to deal with customers.Management was fine.Workplace was good.The hardest part was staying awake at night.The cool part was it was relaxed at night.
good,"I enjoyed it there, made some good friends, gathering the carts outside was quite fun and nice during the summer it was great since you got to relax everyone once in a while and had free drinks."
good,"While I was working at Wal-Mart in Rifle, Co, I have met some nice/interesting people and learned a lot from the job."
good,It was alright working at wal mart because they usually gave you 40 hours a week if you wanted it.  the management is ok and the atmosphere in the store is crazy busy and the work is totally never ending
good,"If was good as long as you were busy,very fast pased,you had to come in being ready to move quickly.the manager were on you which was ok but overall i would go back."
good,"They can work around your schedule, but it's Wal-Mart so you already know how that is. The employees barely know anything and I felt like I was the only one that knew something. There was also a WalMart cheer sometimes and that just made it many times more annoying."
good,"Tasks on a daily basis varied depending on who was scheduled to work that day. On occasion employees from the electronics department would be tasked with working in the toy department, sporting goods or apparel. More times than not all employees from each department except for one  would be called up to cashier."
good,"Even though I got laid off, I'd probably still return to work at Walmart Home Office. It was a stressful and fast-paced work environment with strict policies but it sure beats working at a place that has no policies at all. Would work there again."
good,Walmart is job area were an employee has an option of having a career over just a job. A employee feels part of a community and can improve if wanted .
good,Loved my customers.  I loved the training.  Pathways taught me a lot of leadership roles.  I could not move forward in my role as a Greeter without training in other departments.  It was excellent for the time being while I was in school and wanted to figure out what else I wanted to do with my life.
good,Good place to work and there is a loot of room for advancement. The pay isn’t up to par.  The management team helps you with climbing up the ladder if that’s your desire.
good,"Wal-Mart was a great job but I was unloading a truck and stocking the product at such a cheap price, plus I was doing it over night plus I was single at the time so it was ok bu t the money I was making I felt it could have been better,"
good,"I was always interested coming into work because some days would be different than others and I would be assigned specific tasks that management would trust me with. Some managers lacked some skills which caused me to leave due to the way I was treated while working which caused them to lose one of their strongest employees. the hardest part of this job was probably towards the beginning when I started because there were hardly any employees that worked in receiving which made our requirements for the day more difficult, but as time passed and management hired more employees less stress was on our hands. unloading the trucks was probably the most enjoyable part of the job because even though it is physically demanding we made jokes and listened to music which passed most of the time. It was a great place to work at due to the friendliness of most individuals and the work environment, but two individuals from management treated me poorly which caused me to leave."
good,I liked working at Walmart but i felt i was over looked when it came to a management position. the hardest part of the job was making sure all merchandise off truck is worked to floor without enough people but love the people there.
good,"A work day was sometimes busy and sometimes it wasn't. when it was busy management would even jump on the registers to help the customers.Working on a busy day and not having enough coverage and customers being upset,assisting customers when ai was asked for help."
good,arrive go out to floor help customers and stock shelves.You would have to zone up your area. Sometime had to cover over half of the store depending on position.
good,"Best thing about Walmart was working with different cultures. "
good,"Wal-mart is a good caring company. Depending on your general  store manager. Work with a very diverse group of people that actually works as a team. You learn something new every day. Discipline is handled fairly, in other words ""the punishment fits the crime"" so to speak. Paid vacation time can be spent all at once or day to day."
good,I was not lnowledgeable about FMLA. Supervisor did not make me aware. Could have done more to educate staff. I was satisfied with the schedule and shift. Advancement opportunity was satisfactory.
good,Poca estabilidad por cambios de administracion continuos.
good,"My typical day at work is long, fast paced, grueling, hours dealing with extremely rude people with some nice customers inbetween. we get a 15min break every 2 hours and a mandatory lunch before the 5th hour, but it doesn't feel like enough sometimes. My life at home has gone down hill since getting this job, because of the long hours at work and only having 2 days off a week, my husband and i schedules don't always match up and we barely get time together. the money is the only enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day:"
good,"Walmart is a hard place to work in the stores. Especially as an Assistant Manager. SOOOO many hours, but decent pay. Not every position at the company is this way, but it is especially true of mid-management."
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for 6 years. It started out as a part-time job in high school so I could afford to eat out and pay for gas. Over time I realized there were opportunities to move up and make an impact. I capitalized on my time with Wal-Mart, moved up the management ladder and gained skills I still use today. "
good,Walmart is a pretty cool place to work at. I don’t agree with  management not giving employees training before their job task.  We just assume you know everything.
good,"Working for Walmart has given me an exposure to many different types of customers and working with retail. It has helped teach me social skills and how to provide good service. My department always has high expectations and goals for us to meet and I work with a team of coworkers to complete customer orders. Walmart does get pretty busy during holidays which can be slightly stressful but overtime is available at those times. My job schedule is unpredictable but i feel my position is secure as long as I meet the goals. There are attendance rules which go through a point system for the tardy and absent policy; they are more strict during your first 3 months. If things don’t work out in one position, Walmart is always transferring current associates to different departments but gives multiple chances to employees before termination. It has also taught me the meaning of hard work and earning my pay. It’s great for beginners but can be stressful at times. Sometimes they have little Walmart events and free food in the break room also."
good,"I enjoy the people, the work, the challenges, and the changes. Management varies from store to store, but for he most part try to do their best. I recommend them to everyone. Be willing to ask for help! Keep positive and an open -mind, know what you want, work to that end."
good,Wal-Mart was a part time temporary job. Loved working there and would go back. Had to go back to college full time along with my full time job. They accommodated my schedules to theirs.
good,"A typical day at Walmart included: cleaning around my work space, zoning, interacting/helping customers, bringing out freight/picks from the backroom, cashiering, and helping out with surrounding areas. I learned how to: mix paint, a fair amount of knowledge about hardware/paint/light-bulbs, how the backroom works in retail stores, how to treat customers and employees, and how clean my area should be by the end of the day. The workplace culture is what I enjoyed the most. I never had a problem with other employees or upper management and we treated each-other as a family. The hardest part of the job was just making it feel like you accomplished something out of the ordinary by the end of the day. Days can blend together by doing the same routine every day. When managers need a few people to do special projects I offer my service so I can learn a new trade or put my skills to the test."
good,"Leave your home issues at home, if you dont know how to do to something ask. Cashiers are the backbone of the store dont disrecard what they do as a person. See you customers and workers as why you are still here."
good,Hard work for little money but hard to find other work in this climate if you dont have qualifications so i would say that walmart/asda is a fair palce to work and your wage depends on how many hours you are willing to put in.
good,buen ambiete y compañerismo apoandonos unos a otros
good,I would give the job in general a good rating. Walmart is a good place for employment. Has really good benefits and you can move up quickly. It is a good learning experience for feature jobs.
good,"I actually loved working at Wal-Mart for the most part. There was always something to do, never bored. Although, it does become a problem because you never feel like you never complete anything. You get stopped in middle of something all the time. I loved being able to help customers and associates. Also the fact that I always had something to do. If I'm bored then I don't need to be at work."
good,"Walmart is always a fun friendly place to work as long as your co-workers feel the same way, and its a place where time flies. so if you are the type of person who loves fast paced jobs but also interacting and meeting new people this is a great place to work."
good,The company is a good company but the pay and benefits are not available to a part time employee.  Sometimes the pay is extremely low for what is expected of you.
good,On the job training. Good work family. Busy pharmacy. Enjoy working with/for our patients. Good pharmacists and great pharmacy manager. Pay can always be better.
good,This work facility provided an equal opportunity for me to learn and progress with multiple equipment and marketing tools. I was consistently up scaling in seasonal store advancements and well as character. I observed various products and customers that increased in great community satisfaction. I was allowed to work in a comfortable yet suitable attire during my work shift. The coloration of  unique devices and smiles kept an enormous invite of each day. With great mobility i was allowed to meet and greet and complete assigned task each week.
good,"My time with Walmart was decent. This is a great job for someone just starting out in the workforce and provides essential job skills like teamwork, sense of urgency, and communication. I worked on night shift for 5 years stocking and then customer service days for 1 year while I went to school. "
good,All of my reviews were good ones they had nothing but good things about me like they see me very professional with costumers and that I was always modavated and that my work is very good...
good,"very fast paced, little to no help for department managers. decent benefits but little pay for the amount of work you do, especially department managers."
good,"Walmart was my favorite job. I would recommend any and everybody to work there. Plus, they have awesome benefits and opportunities! I would always go back if I had a chance."
good,"it made me a better, more observant consumer, when I shop at any store, I remember what i learned being a walmart associate, was probably the job where i learned the most about team work"
good,It's ever changing days with no typical outcome to be expected. I learned various market tips that you don't think about as a consumer. The hardest part of the job would have to be standing at all times with virtually no downtime except for the one break you recieve. Getting to know who regular customers are and the conversations that come with it had to be the most enjoyable part.
good,Starting my day off with my expectations for today for myself as well as my associates .Planning for my daily projects given to me from my Store Mgr. Following up and verifying that every project was executed : the hardest part of my day is Time!!not being able to execute  a project with in that day. I'm a very driven person and will stay even if it means staying hours after my shift has ended .Seeing the finish project and the smile from my associates. And our customers being able to have a wonderful shopping experience and finding what they needed .
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es cómodo y amigable, pero cuando eres estudiante, algunas veces los horarios ni se acomodan de manera que no te permitan ni dormir."
good,"I Love My Job. It’s Super Easy & Everyone Works As A Team. Some Days Are Stressful , Some Fast Paced But Overall It’s Laid Back & Relaxed. I Just Wish They Provided Overtime. Extra Money Is Always Needed."
good,"My typical day at work is helping stalk and number one take care of the customers.ive learned how to do some inventory,organization,answer any questions the customers may have. Easiest part of job is trimming the vegetables and the hardest part of my job is pulling skids . Enjoy work with my peers gained and learn so much from them . Management is great gain friendship with them also. When ever there was a problem that I couldn't fix or answer they were easy to get into contact to fix help out with whatever problem there was."
good,I liked working at Walmart out days. Sometimes it was very stressful and hectic. There were days dealing with customer service was very stressful. But overall great job
good,"In a typical day I would clock in, attend the brief meeting and group stretching then go on and work on my tasks.  Management was good at least the ones I met.  Hardest part of the job was taking out the trash because there is so much of it."
good,As far as giving us the opportunity to grow I felt a little tied down which is why I moved on. I was no longer happy there and started making errors at work. In my case I would not go back.
good,it was a good job at the time in my life.. I heard benefits and wage went up so I wouldn't mind going back.. I enjoy the Wal-Mart atmosphere as well it's a place with good vibes and people.
good,I've been at walmart for a long time it was great until the waltons no longer had control of the company the new CEO is very poor and does not give us are benefits that we deserve not the pay
good,Mangers have their issues but overall a decent job only problem is with schedules. Get that fixed immediately along with more cashiers so the other works can get their jobs done
good,la empresa como tal es buena pero a veces los encargados no están capacitados para el manejo de personal
good,"I think Walmart would be a great place to work if they paid employees better. I liked my job, but I worked really hard and felt I deserved more. I think if they would take better care of the associates they wouldn't have as big of a turnover. When I first started, I worked in the deli, learned how to slice cheese and luncheon meats, cook chickens and the other foods on the lunch bar. I went to the meat department after a year where I learned the cuts of meats, how to stock all the fresh meats, luncheon meats, seafood, and breakfast foods. I also worked in the bakery off and on, learned how to bake the breads, ice cupcakes, bag and label everything. When I moved to Jacksonville I worked in a Neighborhood Market, very different, but enjoyed the slower paced atmosphere. I was in 3 different departments, meat, frozen and dairy. One manager to head all 3. I was part of the inventory team, which I learned a lot about the separate departments. I helped open both stores I was employed with, that was the fun part, learning where everything belonged and all the other employees. I worked in Niceville and Jacksonville"
good,"While working at Walmart, I had to work 14 departments on most days with 6 other associates other days by myself.  The only thing I learned there was how to multi-task efficiently. The only thing that was enjoyable, was being able to help customers find what they were looking for or if it wasn't stocked or carried find some way to help them otherwise.  When it comes to management only a couple managers would actually come out if a customer was asking for one."
good,"Great company to work for, because the pay is well and the workload is easy when the expectations are set clearly, but alot of negativity coming from associates and especially management at the particular store I worked in, and it displayed in front of customers."
good,Cashiers as long as you are outgoing and friendly. The people there are friendly you just get a few coustomer that are rude as long as you can maintain a positive attitude then you will be all set
good,"Recently Walmart has taken to eliminating jobs without notice, such as restructuring.  No feedback given on decisions made toward job elimination reasoning.  Very little open positions available to apply for with equal or better job responsibilities and/or pay."
good,Decent place to work. Benefits are good. The scheduling is kind of hard to work with if you don't have set hours. They are great at working with you as far as training goes. If you don't feel like you are ready to go on your own then they don't force you to.
good,I found the work there challenging yet fun. The constant movement of the loading/unloading of the trucks made the time just fly by. Co-workers helped when they could and not afraid to show you the ropes if you need help
good,Overall Wal-mart isn't as bad as most people say it is. Once you work there for a while the benefits available are amazing and definitely worth your wild. The hardest part about working there is the people. If you can make friends with your manager and coworkers then you'll be good to go. But if you get on their bad side then they will not help you unless you are begging.
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers in the fast paced work environment. Yes there are a few challenges somedays but its not anything to hard toto over come.
good,"basic warehouse job. rise before dawn, punch in, move stuff around, hour for lunch, punch out at sundown. learned a lot about sorting, though. everything has to sit on a pallet just so. helps ensure the most freight can be loaded at one time without damage or overflow. packaging is also essential. too much wrap costs more effort to remove and wastes money on buying more. not enough is usually much worse, what with more risk of spill and injury"
good,es buena opción como primer empleo te sirve para agarrar experiencia laboral
good,"Walmart certainly has it's downsides: Wages aren't the best ($11 minimum pay), lots of Walmarts are under staffed to attempting to advance to a new department is very difficult. But I am currently a CAP 2 associate at Walmart. I've grown a close connection with my coworkers and managers. Even associates who aren't even in my department have gained friendships with me. I'm overall glad I work at Walmart and highly recommend Walmart to anyone"
good,"Strict Scheduling and Unfair workloads. No flexibility if you’re someone trying to transition into college. But, great lunch breaks. Good working environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job for me was how many trucks came in a day as well how many pieces (Items) that were on the truck, it could range anywhere from 3000 - 4000 pieces sometimes lower but, it was hard to throw the trucks in the allotted time that was given even with 4-5 people with you."
good,Working at Walmart is a good job to start off with because it helps you with the basic work system on how to deal with people and the basics of having a job
good,"worked there during remodeling, laid off from job. worked 3 shift, good people. training was good, very informed on the remodel process. Regular employees were nice and very helpful. Good place to work. Worked in different departments, moving shelves, reset shelves with product."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, porem com alguns problemas de hierarquia e resolução de conflitos"
good,Through out my time working at Walmart it was ok because it was my first job but it’s not somewhere i see my self working there for more than 5 years its to much and the store i worked for was  unorganize . But they have good pay and is a great job if you need money
good,Fast pace good working hours lots of training well involved leadership.Culture is very good fun and shops are clean you are free to be yourself.Hardest part of the job is see all the cuts and see advancement not part of the future.
good,There are days where the workload may be heavy there are days where you are trying to find things to kill time. the managers are dedicated to getting your tasks done. They also may have you working in an area you have zero knowledge about.
good,"good entry level job for someone with little to no responsibilities, low turnover so therefore  not much opportunity for advancement. good company, though"
good,"Very demanding work environment. "
good,"Most of the jobs are part time. This is why I am looking for a full time job. I work in the evenings folding cloths and making sure everything looks neat and answering the phone. Help out in jewelry and cashier when needed. I have learned to work with an MC40, which gives the price of the item and making price tickets for the clothing and shelves. Replace watch batteries and work on watch bands, taking out links. The building is large so to communicate with other employees we use a walkie to find out if we have a certain item. changing batteries was a hard part of the job, I enjoy working with people."
good,"Great flexibility,  great coworkers,  awesome supervisor  I was able to learn a lot, & had the opportunity to participate in walk for cure,  I love customer care/ service but wish there was more acknowledging of hard working employees.And they definitely need to get better staffed & organized during Christmas."
good,"stocked shelves most of the time, very little customer interaction and a pretty fast pace work force. paid well for the area and had actually one of the better health care options also"
good,"Didnt like the management , I loved working with customers on a day to day basis. Im good with meeting new people and being freindly. The management didn't have enough cashiers staffed."
good,Una empresa de renombre con un buen ambiente de trabajo
good,i myself am a peoples person and love to be around people. but i enjoy meeting new people and doing hands on jobs. I also love the face past jobs that Walmart offers.
good,"I started in 2001 left 2014 because I moved. I'm not sure how pay is anymore but when I was there it was very doable and bonuses too."
good,The atmosphere is friendly and overall relaxed. The managers treat each employee with respect and put their trust within each other. We worked as a team as well as encouraged each other in independent roles.
good,"As a part time job this place is great, starting pay is higher than any other retailer/general store in my area and they have pretty flexible hours as long as you let them know what days you need off 3 weeks in advance"
good,I lived working at Walmart I mostly liked the managers but some were so uptight about there job. They would act as if the other employees were less than them because they had a higher position. But i would recommend working at Walmart they do help you a lot.
good,"Great people, fast paced environment. Can often be understaffed. Great Management for the most part, with a few exceptions. Hardest part of the job can be the customers and how they can treat you."
good,"The associates tend to be friendly and help when asked, often going above regular duties to provide customer service if necessary. Some departments did lack associates to equally balance work load, and often some departments went with out."
good,Working for McDonald's was a very fun an a learning experience for me. I got to meet alot of great hard working people an working there was one of my best jobs I've had so far. I got to see the most important thing there was how to build there great tasting sandwiches. It also gave me alot of courage on what I em capable of as a worker myself.
good,"I would have to say that interaction with the customers was my favorite part of my working to just hear some on the small talk ""build report"" on customers day was satisfiying"
good,"Surprisingly, the environment around me was a very slow moving, non motivated environment.  I always try to find ways to excel and advance in the work place but the staff here did not have the same attitude.  I had the skills from my previous job to cross train and got to work in the warehouse environment and cashier.  Only a few others had the same can do mentality as I had so it was difficult to get others to buy in.  I left because of relocation but would prefer to work in a more motivated and fast paced environment in the future."
good,As an unolader/cap 2 assosciate we had a meeting before we unload the truck or trucks depending on how many we had. After we unload the trucks our supervisor would send on the floor to stock. The hardest part of the job is getting the truck or trucks unloaded on time. I've learned to put the correct freight on the pallet and stack it correctly on the pallet and also how to use a pallet jack. The most enjoyable time was on lunch break and joking with co-workers while unloading the trucks.
good,"it’s a great place to work, however i was working overnight shift from 10-7 & trying to manage my sleep & personal time didn’t really work out that well."
good,"Walmart itself, I would say, is a fair enough place to work if you enjoy retail-type work. The particular Walmart I was at, for a number of reasons, was a problem store, with many factors making it less desirable. Nevertheless, I would work for the company again someday if I am in need of a job."
good,Starting pay at Wal-Mart is eleven dollars a hour. I was usually scheduled nine hour days. I received two fifteen minute breaks and was required to clock out for an hour lunch. I wish I could have continued with my employment there.
good,"it is always a busy day every day. especially during the holidays but overall it is so much fun to be able to help and socialize with others. but since it become very busy, it is hard to keep up some times with everything around you. the hardest part of my job was that I couldn't pick up my 3 kids at the end of the school day and id only see them the next day in the morning."
good,It was a great job that was very convenient for my schedule.The training really prepared me for being on the job. I liked how the managers we very willing to work with my schedule.
good,Trucks would be late and associates don't finish putting away the products before the end of their shift. I learned how to put products away properly from associates that were there before I got there.
good,"Contratación voluntaria como cajero, estabilidad segura hasta que se cumpla la edad limite. Buen ambiente de trabajo y buena redituacion para ser un trabajo voluntario."
good,This is a highly competitive company willing to change with the marketplace. leadership has a clear vision of where the company is headed. The company will change programs to maximize productivity and cut costs
good,Itvwasca pleasant place to work with good people. Itvwas physically taxing at times bht overall itcwas low stress and  had  very nice managersd flexible hours.
good,"Each store has it's own ""family"" of workers who are hard working.   However, the hardwork is very seldom appreciated or recognized on the regional level.  Foexibility of working hours are soon to be a thing of  the past.  When this takes effect,  employees will be very few and far between."
good,The hardest part was some of the customers that would come in. Some would be nice and some would be racist and rude. You just have to keep calm and remember that you have bills to pay
good,"A lot of work that is not equal to pay.  When working at Walmart I didn't feel as though I was a valuable employee. A ""that-a-girl"" would have made a world of difference."
good,"Working at Walmart is truly a learning experience.  No one day is ever the same. I have learned so much about both retail as a business and management as a skill. The workplace culture is diverse and friendly but can be be extremely fast-paced and stressful. Hardest part of the job, the customers, most enjoyable part, the customers."
good,i cant say it was bad they paid good and it was very diverse in there you met a lot of people who were nice and the managers did try to work with your availability
good,It needs improvement when it comes to management employee relationship and needs to be more focused when it comes to the way employees are treated and trained.
good,"A typical day required extensive and exhaustive work for the support position. It wasn't anything necessarily over demanding, but often times felt to be fringe that. On a good day everything was smooth and not much hassle, but on a bad day (lack of available associates, local events creating excessive demand) things could become a tangled mess."
good,It was a really could organized company they taught me a lot of stuff i didn't know. They treated everyone with respect and the same way. Walmart employees was just so helpful when working with them.
good,"I liked working here, the managers are very nice and help when you need it. The employees are great. It is a great work enviornment. It can be stressful at times but there are people who do help."
good,"The Walmart Supercenter in Humboldt is okay to work at, but not the best Depending on when you work in the Garden Center, you can either expect to find yourself on register, running freight, cleaning, building items for customers, or working outside trying to get mulch for buyers. Management ranges from okay to inexperienced, depending on the individual. The hardest part of the job is trying to handle a whole department on days you find yourself all alone, while the most enjoyable is having a good time with coworkers and getting your daily tasks finished."
good,"Working at walmart for me was interesting. i will say that i made alot of friend which i still reside. they gave you good hours, if you wanted a job that keeps you busy and making plenty of money walmart was the place"
good,"I worked for the company for 5 years and my overall experience of the company is that they are customer friendly, fast-pace, and understanding. Worked with a great staff."
good,Its a place to start the work life but not to live off of forever. They have problems like most places but always got the job done everyday. They are also kind of organized.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility and laid back atmosphere which make for a nice work environment. The hardest part of the job is the production standards.
good,This was a very tough job to work at because I worked in the cold and started very early in the morning.  You have no idea when you're going to get off so you could be there all night.
good,"A typical day at work would start from clocking in, putting on your vest, talking to the CSM responsible for your department, and doing whatever is needed throughout the day. I learned that management will do whatever they need to in order to get the job done. The culture in the workplace kind of felt like a clique, everyone had their own groups. The hardest part of being a cart pusher is working in the different weather conditions, for example, working in a 90 degree day to working in 20 degree weather with snow. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with your fellow cart pushers and working with them."
good,The bakery in tumwater washington had a great manager. The people in general were mostly all good people with amazing personalities. The company itself was fair and nice
good,"Walmart is a great place to work but like every place it has its pros and cons. Pros being able to advance up, discounts, and if youre lucky enough to get full time then you get all fulltime benifits. Cons being poor managment, no overtime."
good,"It was a great place to work but my department had a high rate of turnover.  I enjoyed my time there and would like to return someday, if given the chance."
good,It was a great job for people that are more laid back and don’t like to do as much as others. I was a person that wanted to do more and get more done but I couldn’t because The communication from all coworkers were not the best
good,"Benefícios bons para funcionários, oportunidade de aprendizado em vários setores atendimento ao cliente."
good,Days on the job is repedative but when you get past that the days go by faster. wearing relaxing shoes is good because employees have to stand nearing the entire day.
good,It was a great experience in both stocking and laying out the stores as I was part of the expansions of two stores to super centers. the benefit package at the time was really good considering.
good,"I was a third shift cashier. We were understaffed in some areas, over in others. They had a habit of shorting the front end staff, making it difficult to get everything we needed done, to try and get the stocking done. Management was always stressed and it stressed the rest of the staff out. We were very understaffed and the stress mixed with hours getting cut is what made me leave."
good,What I learned from this job was to all ways be patient with everyone and to have a great time management. A typical day was super busy with moving carts and helping customers.
good,"The job was great for a college student, good environment with flexible hours. I enjoyed the people that I work with, the most challenging area was the customers."
good,It's an ok job but their not fair with the pay income is horrible and they cut hours off people timed and that's not a good living job for income and their not fair to people
good,A typical day at Walmart is What i would describe as Fun the Employees And customers  were very nice and friendly Management Ensured Everyone was happy and comfortable with their jobs.
good,"Although I enjoyed working at Walmart, there was no chance for advancement. In order to transf to another position, I would have had to switch to part-time status, and I would have lost all benefits. The work I did was labor-intensive, and as a result, I developed severe arthritis in my hands. Because I was not given an opportunity to take another position, I had to seek other employment."
good,Given the job market on surroundings area Walmart is above the rest as far as pay and schedule flexablilty. Management could use some work but are generally nice and healful
good,"It was my very first job so and i had to move to arkansas for it so its more me at fault for putting so much stress on myself, but the people were nice enough."
good,Walmart Store takes their image to the customers seriously. They are friendly to customers and make sure that the items are visible and eye taking to the customers.
good,"no me quejo de este trabajo gracias a el e aprendido muchas cosas y e tenido cursos como por ejemplo evacuación búsqueda y rescate y contra incendios es muy buena empresa y sus prestaciones también, estoy buscando ser sugerente de esta tienda o de alguna similar con un sueldo mas atractivo.."
good,Walmart was a great first job. It took a little over a year to be hired there and with all the work that was necessary I appreciated the opportunity I was given but I'm looking for a more stable and full time job.
good,can't. complain about Walmart if your not good with customers than most likely no the best place for you other than that if you have no choice Walmart is the place to be
good,good place to work although mgmt. was not always reliable. The benefits were average although the salary was decent overall an ok place to work and take care of the family
good,"Excellent benefits, safe work environment. Walmart is very competitive, they help their customers find low prices with a one stop shopping experience. Walmart keep their shelves stocked."
good,working at walmart is less stressful. No management on your back. It have good benefits. I personally love to work with the customers. The hardest part is having rude customers. Great otherwise
good,"todo muy como par tus ratos libres "
good,Walmart is a face paced environment and can be very stressful. A level head and positive attitude are required every day at work because the customers can and will be very rude. The hardest part of the job for me was the hours they had me working. Going to school full-time while maintaining a high GPA is very hard when you get off work every night at 10 or 11 PM.
good,Everyday at walmart comes with new challenges and learning experiences. I learnt a lot during my job at humber. Management  is good. most enjoyable part that employees celebrate festivals
good,"I enjoyed working here, but the constant turnover and training of new employees, definitely had an effect on my productivity and efficiency."
good,"Maintaining records loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking shelves. may also use a handheld computer to scan items as he stocks them, giving the store a better idea of what is on its shelves"
good,I think with a few more guidelines it could have been better and a lot more respect for the things people can and can’t do would have been helpful in getting things done.
good,"It is a very productive and fast paced work place, the employees are friendly and the managers do their absoloute best to meet the needs u require in the workplace."
good,Working Pick-Up at Walmart wasn't too bad. You are up and moving around on your feat on a daily basis. Some days you'll be moving around the store more than others. Over all if you can keep track of a package and learn where items are in the store you'll have an ok time.
good,Working here was an ok experienece... i wish the management was a little better... i had a few issues with the floor supervisor not doing her job... pay was decent
good,the management was ok and a normal productive day at work. I learned how to use a scan gun. Nothing was really hard about job nor real exciting either.
good,"I liked Walmart, the bosses were good, the hours were pretty good, some cashier work, helping customers is something I like, zoning was pretty good work, good breaks and an hour for lunch"
good," Develop the customer service procedures, performance level and QA standards for the organization"
good,"There is a large number of people that I respect and love working for at Wal-Mart, just as there are some that do make the job more difficult. While some aspects of the different stores vary, the standards the company sets are high, as they should be. They workday can vary, but overall, it is becoming more focused on the customer perspective, and everything done is to improve the customer's shopping experience. "
good,"Faced paced environment constantly changing"
good,"Depending on store location, team culture can help in career advancement. In others, however, a selfish environment may be evident. Overall the fast-paced environment ensures that problem finding and solution sourcing skills are developed which can be transferred to any business environment."
good,"Walmart was an ok job , my 2nd job ever . they had flexible hours and great benefits . they bounced me around through different departments but for the most part I liked the job ."
good,Really great place with really great people. Management can sometimes get out of hand but there are only so many of them. Employees are phenomenal and management is great.
good,I worked the very hard  difficult hours the overnight  it was very  challenging and could be   Over whelming  but the job got Done  clean & neat at a decent time I learned to work Fast and clean  managers are very pushy but I got through it Some was very  understandable  any problem with workers or personal they always have a  option and they really listen
good,A day at work it could be slow or busy. I learned that customer service is everything. management does not treat you fairly. Hardest part of the job is trying to figure out where everything is at in the big store..Most enjoyable is meeting new people.
good,Doing everything that my bosses want me to do can get stressful. Other days are boring. Supervisors do all they can to help with customers problems. The hardest part of my job is to explain how self check registers work and calm customers down when the register fails. Also having to check IDs for beer or cigarettes. Best part is when a customers thanks me for helping them.
good,"I worked for one of the bigger distribution centers. It was a great job, with great pay, but people where over worked and struggling to stay ahead with their work."
good,I liked working there. They gave us constant training and followed the rules and regulations for a good working environment. There was always something to do which is good.
good,"I really like my job at wal-mart, if they could work with my hours I'd never leave! Everything is manageable. Its stressful on some muscles and sleep especially if your on third like me"
good,"There were some difficulties, but those were largely due to higher-up individuals being negative forces within the work environment. When I had time to do work on my own, I was able to understand the work that was required of me, and to thrive. I got very good at the job assigned to me, and even got to learn a lot of other useful tasks (ie working the baler) along the way."
good,Great benefits. Able to advance quickly if you want to do the work. Lounge area is adequate. Easy and convenient location. Co-workers are friendly. Several store changes in the past few months.
good,Great place to work if you don't mind the hours and part time work. Stock and working freight is a must. Running cash registers also. Lunches are an hour long
good,If yoo are short handed they expect you to work 10 times harder. If you don't they will write you up and keep you in eye sight. They promote their favorite workers that does not work hard and always be buddies with them. I believe they have to start treating everyone the same.
good,Walmart is a great job sometimes it can be kinda bad but it’s okay management could be bad to but overall they give you great hours & a lot of good benefits
good,"Walmart was my first job after graduating high school. During my time at Walmart i assisted as a sales associate , phone operator , and jewelry associate. Walmart trained me appropriately and kept my training up to date in each of these areas. This was a great job start for me . I started off making 7.25 per hour at Walmart and departed making $11.00 per hour. I departed from Walmart because i did not have any opportunities to advance from part time to full time . I was offered a better paying job so i gave Walmart a two weeks notice and thanked them for the opportunity ."
good,"The atmosphere was pleasant, busy , and fast paced I loved working there and meeting people on a daily basis from all strains of life and the shopping experience was fabulous"
good,"How to address all customers complaints and concerns in a professional and respectful manner."
good,I did no get enough hours working here.  The hours I did get were inconsistent and all over the board.  The communication between shifts was not adequate.
good,It was busy and I always helped stock when it was slower. I ran a cash register and helped stock and keep my area clean. It was a part time job while my kids were in school. It served a purpose at the time.
good,Walmart is a great facility that can help an individual learn new ideas and new tasks that can help them thrive when looking to promote themselves to a more rewarding career.
good,"same thing everyday except sometimes we had to unload two trucks and not just one so it would be a little stressful. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people you worked with, they were laid back most of the time."
good,"Hard to get full time work.  Good for students, but not someone raising a family.  Some favortism among management, but I suppose that's typical anywhere you go."
good,"This was a great company at first but the longer i was there the more i saw what went on behind closed doors."
good,"Trabajar en equipo "
good,"I enjoyed every single co worker I had; when I lost my job due to childcare I was very upset. I worked hard to make sure my two children had childcare (they were on a waiting list at daycare) so when my childcare fell through, I was forced to call out. I had 3 call outs in five months which unfortunately cost me the job. I was a good worker and was learning everyday to be a better technician and understand the company's policies. I personally feel that corporate is extremely strict on certain policies; so strict that we weren't allowed a water bottle in the pharmacy or allowed to wear pants or jackets with pockets. Working for Walmart sometimes made me feel like number instead of a trustworthy human."
good,Resources available to you at all times. Human Resources are top notch. Management is a little stretch thin. Occasionally will run into a bad Manager/Employee but they never last long. If you are looking for a Good place to work this is the place.
good,"Most days were pretty standard, working as a cashier I saw a wide variety of people and had to be able to happily deal with each one as I took care of their purchases. Management was easy to get along with though they were a little difficult to get a hold of when they were needed. This was thankfully counteracted by fellow workers who for the most part were happy to assist a fellow co-worker. The hardest part though was trying to balance this with college life though a part of me does still miss some of my co workers and being able to interact with so many faces."
good,i had heart problems going into work at Walmart they knew this i provided Dr notes and everything for missed and absent days management said i was fine. then i am told oh we are letting you go for missing to many days.It was not my direct managers fault it was someone higher up the corporate chain.
good,"My position is new at the store and is based on online orders and such you know OGP (online grocery pickup) the issue is though there's no earn respect there's just give it or go home. My position I love to do but there are some trashy assistant managers and childish high school gossip. Other department managers act worse than kids, but the pros to it is that some that also got insulted cause other positions look down on them told me I don't have to respect someone who didn't earn it and that I should push through it, unlike my own boss who just was all ""either listen or you know clock out and go home for the day"" So instead of standing up for his entire crew we just have to take the fact that our hard work is considered ""laziness"" but thanks to the other managers I was annoyed the entire day but they eased it for me, I was tempted to change positions to cart pushing or something to keep me away from that negative nonsense or quit altogether. It might seem small to them but respect is a big thing and the fact the guy literally aimed at us with his statement of ""no laziness on around me"" when we just finished doing a job and he claimed he saw me doing nothing all day when I just clocked into said job an hour before he set eyes on me after coming back from a staging. A customer said I was the nicest person she met so far and that it was the worst Walmart she has been to, at first I was like I don't agree this Walmart allows you to have fun while you work, like not be miserable while you work, but after today I am starting to believe her myself."
good,"It is a really good place to work, always busy and there is always something to do, or someone to help. The people there are very friendly. I enjoyed working there."
good,my experience with Walmart was at times great but at other times not so much. It is a worthy company with good people but some of the management were hard to deal with as well as some of the coworkers in the same field. Most of this was only because people wanted to move up in the company to make more money and that is understandable.

good,"Loved my job and my crew there. I was in a bad accident and had to have surgery and when I came back to work it was just different."
good,Changed a lot over the years some good some bad.  Unstable at regional level management leading to many change in directions and level of importance of certain tasks.  Spends too much time focusing on other companys instead of doing what they do best.
good,"The job isn't perfect but it is a great place to work especially if you're looking for a place to give you a lot of hours. On top of that , the management at my particular store were very patient and easy going and made the job much easier."
good,"CAP 2 Backroom Associate is pretty cool on days where there is one truck, but when there's two trucks, it can get stressful. Also, everyday I feel underpaid, but I didn't mind since it's not a job I was making a living off of. IF ITS A JOB YOU PLAN TO LIVE OFF OF, DONT WORK THIS JOB AND POSITION."
good,It is a good place to work with advancement opportunities. The work can be hard at times but they pay well. They have a family atmosphere and will inspire you to work with them.
good,"That is a good workplace to work. Better if near your home. Their is no resin to stress of. Just has to care about to don’t gain negative points. Be nice with customers and always take it easy are the style of the succesful workers. Don’t care, but pay attention to supervisors, because they observe too much."
good,"A typical day at work is very calculated, everything that everyone in the store is required to do is listed out and maintained in a company planning guide. The job as a manager is to verify and follow up on store associates to ensure processes are being followed, while developing plans and strategies for future store level projects and events. The culture of the store changes from store to store, but the management tends to be relatively close, spending a lot of time together and encouraged to work with each other. In the company I have learned lots about people, money, and retail management, having to develop plans and put plans into action while juggling many other responsibilities. The hardest part of the job is the life balance, it can be very rewarding having a successful inventory or Christmas holiday, but especially during busy times, and being salaried, with only one day off at a time it becomes very difficult to separate career and home life. On the flip side, it is very rewarding to see your associates grow and develop as you work with them to improve skills and processes. There are lots of positives within the company, the ability to move up is outstanding, always being pushed to improve yourself and grow within the company without being forced to do so, everyone that works within the store gets along well, almost forming a family based environment."
good,"it was a nice place to work, but no communication between management and employee's, I was hired for a position and I ended up doing more and more once they knew I could do alot more than what I was hired for."
good,"Associates polite and hardworking, but management all on edge and possibly overworked, which rubs off on associates. Management and HR do not respond to issues in a timely manner. Also terrible lack of communication between management to associates."
good,"Productive place to work , but sometimes it was stressful because of lack of personal or slow people that didn't know how to multi-task . There were times that there was lack of communication among the  team or management."
good,Their a very good company. They all know how to get along and work together.i want to thank Walmart for letting me work with them. Letting me see how it is to have a team.
good,"Walmart had my back when I needed time off for back surgery, but they were unable to accommodate my return to work and put me on a twelve week personal leave."
good,This was a fairly good place to work management could have been better and the pay should have been more then a regular cashier.i would go back to work for this company but the pay rate would have to be more than what I got which was only almost 9 dollars an hour
good,"Wal-mart is a career oriented productive business. It offers great benefits. They promote within the company, which is awesome for associate. They offer flexible hours."
good,overall it was a good place to work and i am currently trying to get rehired there. a great deal of happiness depends on how the manager over you treats you. but there is a large community of management to talk to and the bonus every three months is really nice.
good,Worked at this walmart for a few years and never had any problems. It's a good job and it's a pretty safe environment. I would recommend for a first time job
good,I recommend working at walmart its a good place to work. They offer tuition reimbursement. they also train you to be a leader. Work is enjoyable in a productive environment.
good,A very fast paced job. It was hard at times. Didn't like the time limit of working the freight.  Co-workers were friendly. TV in lunchroom was a good.
good,Soon as you arrive to work start immediately. Learn how to enhance my customer service skills. Management could be more hands on . Work place culture is mixed with a variety of people. I think the hardest part is the work load and not many workers.  The most enjoyable part is learning the
good,"I loved working as a cashier, serving people is fun and the job certainly doesn't get boring. The friends you meet are unbeatable. However, beware of lazy and unprofessional management"
good,"A good place to work just the pay isn't enough, looking for more possible opportunities and make a better life for my family and start a new chapter in my life."
good,There Is a lot more work and productivity going on than just helping customers. I have a lot of experience working in retail. I am always surprised at what the day brings me. the most enjoyable part of my day; The customers and the people I work with. I really like my store director.(AWESOME)
good,Great job for a college student. Part-time position hours were very minimum.Have to stand constantly with minimum breaks. It teaches you how to work at a fast pace.
good,"I was always scheduled to work long hours during the weekends since i was attending school full time which did not allow for other festivities. Once i out in my two weeks notice since i was going away for school,They began treating me horribly."
good,"I have worked for Walmart for about to years and i have to say its one of the best jobs have had. i have not gotten as many hours as I would like, but I have gotten enough to make a decent living for the most part. the staff is friendly and easy to get along with. The mangers are also pretty nice as well and fair for the most part."
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Walmart! As a cashier, it wasn't hard to be trained. You'll basically get your training through the CBL's that you'll do and when you first bag, you bag as you're comfortable. As time went on, I learned how to bag effectively without using unnecessary bags, unless requested. The only times I have found Walmart to get on my nerves, was when we ran COMPLETELY out of bags 5 times within a 4 month span. Another thing, they do not accept doctor's excuses and they run off of a point system, so for the first 6 months of working there, you've got 4 points you can get before you're fired and after you've worked there for 6 months, your points jump up to 9, but it is very inconvenient that they don't accept doctors excuses as a valid reason for missing a day. Overall, Walmart has been a great company, but could definitely use a change of management."
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work at. The pay was very good, the hours were consistent, and there were also lots of benefits for the full-time worker. However, if the wrong person was moved up to management, problems would arise very quickly and nothing would be done to fix them."
good,"Working at Walmart was nice at the time, good benefits, decent pay and the store I was at was willing to work around my class schedule in both of the store I worked at.  The worst part of working there were the holidays we never could get any holidays off except for Christmas."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart.  The management and employees are usually not the problem it would be the customers and they are a lot to deal with, but if you have patience and the ability to adapt then you will be fine."
good,It was a great place to work at .I worked for  people ready got me the job my work kept me busy until it was time to get and the other workers helped me when I need help and the customers make your job great to I would work there again if I had the chance again would just like to get more money for my work .
good,I loved my job at Walmart Automotive center. This was my first job working with vehicles and I learned everything from oil changes to fuel injections and fixing tires. My management wasn't the best which is why I left. Regardless of that I loved being able to listen to music and work at somewhat my own pace. Most enjoyable part of my job was working on larger tires on bigger trucks because it was very physical and made me feel like I could do anything.
good,A good place to grow with a good culture in place.  Work life balance at corporate offices is tough as you could be buried under a lot of projects to work with.
good,what I learned from this jobs was to no matter how the customer feels help them the best way that u can and make sure that they are satisfied . just needs better people to communicate with such as call outs if you wanted to speak to someone they never answer the phone
good,"Fast paced, always on culture that expects and demands the best from their leadership team. This company is aggressively pursuing all channels of retail fulfillment. The company is willing and actively investing in the newest technology to deliver a total customer experience."
good,"tratar con los clientes, sueldo muy minimo, promociones a largo plazo"
good,Good company to work for if you're a student or retired. will get as many hours as you need and the pay is good too. can become very stressful tho depending on your department. But a lot of departments can be very laid back.
good,"Fast pace to work for and every day its a big work change "
good,It's a great company and the work is not hard at all. I would say the biggest problem is with the management and their lack of communication to their employees.
good,"The average day as a front end clerk (cashier) consists of interacting with customers, checking them out, lifting items, and cleaning as necessary. My managers in Illinois were great, I cannot say that all of them are. The hardest part is dealing with irritating customers who always think they are right."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. A typical day would be to get signed on to your computer and begin to work. You would get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute or 1 hour lunch you prefer. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was on flextime.  You could come into work as early as 6 am and leave out by 76 pm.  They only requested to put in a 40 hour week.
good,Ok place to work if you don't mind standing on your feet.  Your work experience depends on the store's manager so it could be horrible or it could be great.
good,"I loved my job at Wal-Mart and had a great time always."
good,"management and culture vary based on the location, the East Peoria Walmart was not stressful and was very forgiving. A typical day consisted of unloading the trucks onto pallets (usually until the first break), loading those items into their aisles, and some training/cleaning if there was time left."
good,Everyone was so friendly and welcoming they felt like a second family. Sometimes as a cashier you come across customers with bad attitudes and sometimes you have strangers who make your day.
good,"nice work environtment, gives associates the ability to multitask. it can be fast paced at times but its nice. I recomend walmart to anyone lokking for a job, very nice company"
good,good place to work if you do not get consumed by office drama.Management felt like family. Got great experiences from working here great people to work for.
good,A typical day at work consisted of working with employees to assigned tasks to finish by the end of the shift while assisting customers with questions/problems.
good,the work days were fast and slow depending on the day we were having and on Holiday there was a lot of over time for the employees to be able to acquirer.
good,Uma empresa que coloca o cliente em primeiro lugar de tudo e assim tornar o lugar melhor cada vez mais.
good,The pay was ok. The work place had a lot of rules that barely managers themselves followed. Situations with cross contamination happened in meat section
good,"Além de nossa área, temos um contato bem próximo as demais áreas, assim tendo uma boa comunicação do trabalho em geral, para ambos os lados. Trocando informações e melhorando o trabalho prestado. Bonificações, uniforme, equipamento de segurança de qualidade. Encarregados preparados."
good,Walmart has been a good place to work while I was in school.  They worked with me as my schedule changed every semester.  I feel like I learned a great deal about time management.
good,Very good place to work for a first time job or as part time. Management is usually willing to work with your scedule and workdays are typically standard 8 hour shifts with an hour lunch. Depending on your position/ job code the pay is decent all around for the most part.
good,"Loud atmosphere , fast paced although people can be easy to get along with. Big turnover but i been there 12 years . time for a career change. Easy to work freight but can be strenuous."
good,You will stay busy your whole shift. Either your helping a customer out or you are stocking the shelves. It can get a little frustrating at times but just know that you have other employees by your side.
good,Consideró que es una gran empresa con una cultura de valores clara y perfectamente establecida que destaca la equidad de género y con oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"A typical day at Walmart DC is going in to a start up rally to find out about safety and the workload. then it is off to the spurs where we are walking, scanning, lifting, filling orders and shipping for 8 to 10 hours. With two 20 min breaks."
good,"very busy, learned a lot, management is not so great they don't do there job half the time, they have you doing 3 people jobs besides your own, the discounts are good especially at Christmas time"
good,id go to the back to unload the truck for 2 hours the theres a 15 vmin break and you either go bac kto unloading a second truck or stkc shelves for 2 hours till the hour lunch after that 2 more hours of stocking till the senond 15 min break and after that 2 more hours of stocking till we leave.
good,That company is all about customer service. It can be fast pace when busy but it does have down times where you can get other work done. Best part about the job is the friends you make there.
good,"If I had the opportunity to work for Walmart again, I would apply. I did not stay long enough to get a good feel for Walmart's culture. I wanted to primarily focus on my education during that time in my life."
good,"Working at Walmart has many benefits to someone looking to move up, as long as you are focused and on time. hardest part would have to be the lack of good management."
good,Working in management at Walmart is not for everyone.  The hours and expectations are demanding and at times daunting.  You are some times asked to do more than is possible because of staffing struggles.  If you're looking for a career with advancement opportunities and you aren't afraid to work and have open availability there is plenty of room to move forward.
good,"So far there is a lot of teamwork, with the coworkers, which I love!  The managers could use a bit more experience with the night shift also.  Hardest part would have to be, not running after the people who steal.  Most enjoyable part would be how fast the time goes by.  And the music."
good,"Greet your customer with a smile, ask them did they find everything you looking for. Also, you take a 15 min break, 1 hour lunch and another 15 mins before you leave."
good,The management at Walmart doesn't seem to know what each other are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is meeting all different kinds of people and helping them the best you can.
good,"It's a good place to work. Management sucks, but overall it is not bad. 11 the hour, good hours and a bonus every 3 months after 9 months of work. Stressful and very fast paced."
good,Walmart is a funned easy environment to adjust to. The associates are always welcoming. The management team sometimes is hard to deal with. Theres is always room to grow.
good,"zoned your area making sure it looks nice, whenever a customer wanted to buy a firearm you ran the backround check to see if they are applicable. At times you may help other departments with their stocking."
good,"As a cashier, it was easy and quick paced, but the customers are terrible. Depending on your location of course, but it seemed like customers did not view cashiers as people worthy of politeness. However, as a warehouse worker, that was rewarding because of its hard work but easily understandable objectives."
good,"I liked my job at Walmart and would work for them again. I was able to get paid a decent wage and the scheduler was very accomadaring with hours and the shifts that I worked,"
good,"Wal-Mart pays very well for the work that is done. You must be a hard worker to survive there, however do not expect recognition for the work you do unless you are friends with Management."
good,Great place to work and learn things. As you work you also learn. Every situation is unique and may require different approaches. The hardest part of the job was the old management.
good,"If you get in at a store with good management it’s an enjoyable place to work. It can be stressful at times, but that’s to be expected with retail. There’s many different positions at Walmart, find what fits you and you’ll be just fine."
good,"I liked my job, but when new management took over it stopped feeling like a family and more like a shark tank. I liked how I learned to work different departments, but never got proper recognition."
good,"while the job is more high paying then others the stress of some management is unnecessary and sometimes the work conditions are not favorable either. for most this is a good job, depending on what department you are hired in for."
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart because the managers are incredibly kind and understanding, and as long as you ask off far enough in advance, you're more than likely going to get the day off unless it's a holiday known for last-minute shoppers. Coworkers are friendly and customers are usually nice. You also get several breaks, including lunch, if you work a full shift."
good,"Fun people but always busy"
good,"A great place for a first job, and even a potential career.  Company policy is rarely followed, and your work experience is almost entirely based on your store manager."
good,i had to get there 7 minuites early or arrive on time i waited until the manager came into the room to give the instructions where everyone was supposed to go and then i had to go to my position and start stocking the shelves and organizing
good,"I truly enjoyed my job at Wal-Mart.  I enjoyed waiting on my customers and making them smile. The job itself was fast-paced but I always had time to communicate,as well as,listen to my customers,coworkers and managers."
good,A typical day at work was very interesting because you never knew exactly how busy you were going to be. You could come in to a super easy day or a really busy day.
good,Walmart paid the same as the rest of retail for that time but their benefits out weighted most of them.  I enjoyed working their and assisting the customer locate their items and needs
good,"Always short staffed and the day went off and on with its busy and slow periods."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work. Management was very helpful with everything. My managers would jump on the registers and help if there were long lines. Walmart treated their employees great. I got paid well and the work was easy. I was always asked to pick up extra hours which was great for me because I needed it. You get plenty of breaks, and there is a ridiculous number of times you are allowed to call in. "
good,Supervising employees to remodel a Walmart store. Traveling all over the east coast and mid west. Hardest part of the job is being away from your family 20 days at a time.
good,"iQor, as a whole is a good company. Since it's a BPO, of course, they have the usual BPO KPI and KPOs. They have AHT and other targets to hit. The hardest part of the job is to deal with hard-headed costumers, but the most enjoyable part is when you get to be with your teammates."
good,Certain jobs have great training and others are extremely lacking.  I for one feel that you can learn anything if given the right training and tools to do your job.
good,Working at walmart is a fun environment but I'm looking for something that correlates with my major which is accounting or for something that differentiates in responsibilities
good,"Walmart is a good place to start your career. The best thing about Walmart is Job Security. Even at peak recession, we didn't feel any issue in regards to layoff."
good,"I do not like to post any kind of reviews with any kind of company.   I like to keep things on a positive note.   Also In my opinion, I do not like to say bad things about any company."
good,"I really enjoyed working for wal-mart, I enjoyed the people I worked for and the associates I worked with. I didn't find any thing hard about working for wal-mart. Working for wal-mart allowed me to do alot of volunteer work in my community."
good,"I worked for Walmart almost 4 years, my only complain is management, they can be rude, disrespectful I and sometimes they can use their manager powers to abuse of your hard working skills, other than that I learned so much with them I was really happy working there until management got out of control"
good,It is a company that provides multiple benefits and room for advancement and gives also multiple options for on the job training and as well as medical benefits and discounts
good,I’m so happy that I left the job with differences experience from managers and co workers. Everybody work together as a team managers are hard working too.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, ideal para una persona que recién ingresa al ámbito laboral."
good,Walmart was a fun place to work at. sometimes it was hard because of the lack of staffing but otherwise was great and the employees were always very friendly and easy to get along with
good,The job is descent for the pay. Most days are easy unless you are shorthanded.  For the most part lunch break is nice having a whole hour to relax. You are tired when you get back but you work through it. For the most part 3rd shift is not bad.
good,Have good pay and good hours. You could work as many hours you want for over time. I had some of the best assistant manager at store 3185. I been at Walmart for 3 years.
good,"Working in this pharmacy was fun and fast-paced. We were a team, and everyone knew their roles and worked efficiently together. Learning was encouraged, and the pharmacists were interested and engaged with their technicians."
good,"trabalhava como caixa operadora, gostava muito."
good,For the Distribution Center it pays very well. The work is hard but the pay makes up for the work. If you plan to work there you must hit production every day
good,I have worked for Walmart 24 years. I never thought in a million years this would happen & The company big find us a position. But Walmart is a good company to work for.
good,Empresa de grande porte. Aprendizado a trabalhar em grupo
good,"I would arrive early and check into my register. I would help set up the coffee bar and ensure we had bags at the self check stations. I rang up customers and assisted as needed throughout the day. I loved my co workers, they were an awesome group of people to work with. Only the front end manager there at the time was very negative and difficult to work with. Fortunately they are in another department now. The store offers employee discounts, training and served us catored meals on holidays! This stores employees also personally helped my family through a crisis and have done so for others as well. I learned that they are truly amazing people at the neighbourhood market where I worked! The hardest part of the job was dealing with the front end manager at the time. The best part of the job were my co workers and our customers!"
good,"I left only due to Sam's Club closing and no comparable positions open at Wal-Mart, plus got a great severance. Wal-Mart has the latest in technology and tools to make our job easier and error proof as well as allow us to give great customer service. Would like to go back part-time or per-diem. Bathrooms in pharmacy rather than having to close pharmacy any time you are the lone pharmacist on."
good,"4 am unload truck. Inventory and stock. Thinking of ways to best complete tasks. Working with people. Good management. Fast pace work. Benefits, my associates."
good,the customers was not the problem it was the head employees and managers always were trying to make you look bad especially when it came to advancing to different departments
good,"Do not apply here if you expect a free check. Job is hard with long hours. Pay and benefits are in the lead for this industry, with much depending on your personal engagement. Keep in mind it is a large corporate enterprise, so be proactive with your needs. Safety focus is at a premium, small missteps and lack of concentration can KILL you or others. All said it was a great opportunity in my life with longevity security."
good,It is what you would expect from a Walmart.  Retail work.  Many options for employment to allow you to find the area you best fit in and enjoy.  Hours can be set around an individuals availability.
good,"Basic day to day operations were consistent. You more or less know what needed to be done. But there's also the unknown of what all you'd be asked to do as well. Customers would determine where you would wind up. Associates not showing up for work would determine where you would wind up. The management team during your scheduled shift would determine where you would wind up. But you were always expected to get the same thing done day to day. From personal experience, I almost never completed my assigned projects. "
good,"Began at Wal-Mart as part-time grocery stocker, and over time I earned and was determined to show i could handle one of the most demanding aisle on the grocery side.  They recognized my hard work and after three months I was full-time, handling the most demanding aisle alone. It was only after I had knee surgery that I needed to change from the demand and was moved to the Modular team/stocker. this is when I was able to learn more aspects of Wal-mart, from setting mods to inventory control."
good,A regular day is filled with plenty of work and customer influx. the people you work with are friendly and all carry a good attitude about themselves.
good,"Boa empresa com muitos beneficios mas precisa melhorar em alguns pontos,como aumento de salário"
good,The job in the company is both easy and hard depend of the spot your in. They will keep you on your toes and a place to make your mark in the company.
good,Walmart was a good place to work but they didnt except doctors notes and customer service managers dont help at the service desk so your always going on break late or not at all which led me  to me quiting my job..
good,lots of interesting this to learn and do at walmart specially marketing and how things work in a big retail company it was fun not so stressful   fun employees working with
good,"Tive o privilégio de trabalhar com uma Gerente de equipe espetacular (Ivani), que conversa com cada colaborador de sua equipe incentivando e procurando ajudar em todos os aspectos, inclusive fora do ambiente de trabalho. Dentro da empresa, equipe unida, ajudando uns aos outros."
good,A great company to work for if you are lucky enough to make enough hours to qualify you for the benefits.  According to the store manager some of them tolerate a lot of drama.
good,"Not a bad place to work,people were nice and helped you out a lot,it’s a team work type job and everyone played there role so it made it easier on everyone"
good,"I loved working at Walmart, the opportunity to grow and learn about new positions is always available, management open door policy was greatly appropriate and working for the company as a whole was amazing. I hated that my position was changed and i was unable to continue but i will always love Walmart and working the company"
good,Going for returns an returning items to their proper departments an then going to get you're stock work done. Always helping customers as you go along with the day. Followed by zoning you're area then going to register or getting other areas returns or work needed.
good,"A good company to grow with. Lots of job opportunities. Lots of stores to go work at. 401k, stock, health, vision, vacation, sick time, lots of benefits."
good,"Lots of change and innovation have been happening in the stores during the last ten years. Key is to embrace it and lead it. The district manager who hired me told me that if I did what the company told me to do, I would be successful. Nearly two decades later I can say he was right."
good,Great company to work for great problem solvers. They let you learn at your own pace and they are very flexible. Management is good to their employees and many benefits are available.
good,I always considered Walmart to be a fair place to work. They are pretty accommodating and seem to care about their employees. Unfortunately there were no opportunities for myself to advance and that brought me to change careers.
good,Es una empresa con buen ambiente laboral y todas las prestaciones.
good,"Walmart is a good company. They expect a lot from their associates, however their are successful and they do share that success with their associates. Not a lot of retail companies provide bonus to hourly and part time associates."
good,I enjoyed the other associates along with multiple breaks and a long lunch. The assistant managers were a pleasure to work under. The customers were always friendly and a pleasure to help.
good,It is a great place to work with good benefits. Walmart is both customer and employee focused. Typical day at work is super busy with a lot of monotonous work.
good,Be great for someone going back to school cause they also do a helping hand with that. They sure do care about there wally family.We see each other as one and one big happy family
good,"Um ambiente bom para trabalhar, equipe colaborativa e prestativa."
good,"excelente empresa, sempre abre portas aos funcionários porém ainda oferece baixos salários."
good,"A normal day at work for me as a cashier was mostly scanning items, greeting customers, and zoning my area when there were no customers. Also once the store slowed down I would perform returns. Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. They are so willing to help you. I got along very well with the people I worked with. My experience working there was a positive one."
good,Ótima para se trabalhar.Preocupada com os associados.Pagamento de bônus PPR.
good,Walmart provided me with so much experience and customer service. It is a great job experience for young people. It teaches you how to deal with people and good work ethic skills.
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart. I had a good attendance, good work history and got along with all my co-workers. I was fired from Wal-Mart due to miss information that they were given. I took medication that I had held onto in case of emergency which they was expired. After going to court with them over the matter the judge explained to them what I did was not wrong and I should of not been fired."
good,Everyone was great besides pharmacy manager. Very fast paced work and fun. Manager made things miserable and always chose favorites. Very dramatic. It would have been an amazing job with better manager
good,good starting place to work. I received health insurance after a year of working part-time. I worked grocery for one year then the deli to make $1.00 more per hour.
good,"They go on about how management is always trying to improve and help and they'll listen/hear you out... however! they'll never implement anything because it's the whole ""why fix what's not broken."" because in their opinion everything is fine and it works but that's because the staff is able to find their own work-arounds to make it work. Not like they would know anyways, most of them are never on the floor."
good,Meeting and serving others. I love helping people and it is a great place to be able to do just that. Lots of friends made through my experience at Walmart.
good,Wal-mart was a fun work place. You meet interesting people. As long as you stay busy they don't mimd if you talk to other employees. They do offer stock options to buy also.
good,Great place to work. friendly people. Hours are good. pay is okay. can be stressful. Great first job. A lot of chances to go up in the company. Would work here again.
good,Basically it depends on which location the person works or even the department in which the person works in. Its not the best laying job but it does pay better now than when I was employed there.
good,Due to inconsistant schedule i am leaving wallmart. Its good working there but the hours are not flexible. I am looking for some fixed schedule from 8- 5 AM
good,over all loved my co workers and my supervisors  enjoyed my jobs  . Need for better training. could use better benfits and pay should be more . Great experience
good,Walmart is a great company to work for if you are single you can make very good wage when you get to management level if you are willing to work very long hours.
good,I had a great experience working at the walmart corporate call center. It taught me to be quick witted and always have a solution for the customer. I learned a great deal about how to handle customers who are very stressed and need an answer right away.
good,"Hours were fairly flexible, it was fast paced work which made the days go by pretty quickly, management was fairly easy to get along with, fun coworkers and they always have an open door policy which is great."
good,"I was there 4 months and left for another job. The manager I had was so rude to me, idk y she didn't like me, always had some thing to say. Other than that the job was easy breezy and pay is good."
good,"um lugar agradável de trabalhar bons, colegas e um ótimo gerente."
good,its been almost 2 years since i left but it working at walmart wasnt as bad as its reputation would suggest. management was nice and helpful as well as the colleagues on my side of the store. only left because i moved far away
good,es una empresa muy responsable en cuanto a beneficios
good,Pay was on low end of pay scale.  Never scheduled enough competent floor associates.  I had people ask for help all over the store because they knew someone would be in Pharmacy.
good,"mes journées chez Walmart étaient plutôt chargées. j'y ai beaucoup appris, l'aspect difficile était de concilier travail, famille et études."
good,"I come from a commercial fishing boat where it was fast paced, and you were expected to work as fast as possible. There was quite a change going to overnight maintenance associate, there was always work to be done, but no rush on it.  Not saying that they're lazy, because work is always being done, just at a slower pace."
good,"You get to work with some amazing people."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job, is Customer Services. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers by giving them Excellent customer Services, with a smile and helping them with their groceries, or by answer question, or by taking time to show them where the items are. Cash handling, Checks, and Money Order. I like working with many Culture at Wall Mart and learning about different culture.. It is a most enjoyable place to learn and work at. you are learning by having fun while you are learning your job, and being the best at it. I would give and Overall rating an Four out of five for best place to learn and work for Wall Mart. What I like about working for this Company is the fact there room to grow and expand your knowledge by becoming a Manger, Clerk, Work in the Auto Parts. There always room for growths. That's the best part about working at Wall Mart. The most enjoyable part of my job was. if I didn't know the answer to the question. I can always count on my coworker for help. they were always there. I count on my Manger to guild me threw any problems, and answer the question that I may  have.  The hardest part of the job is keeping your focus and maintaining it when a customer might be upset and shouting at you. You have to keep your focus by trying to help her, or requesting that the manger can assist the customer as well."
good,"Thankful that my position at Walmart has allowed me to pay for my college education out of pocket. One thing I would change is our 30-minute lunches in the pharmacy, but the rest of the store gets 1-hour lunches."
good,Working at Walmart is a hard working job that is stressful. Not everybody is on your side or there to support you it’s each men for theirselves. It’s a job that sometimes you end up loving what you do or you end up unhappy and you just see it as a stepping stone in life. Walmart is a job that can teach a lot of skills .
good,"Clean environment and discounts, working here there is a demand for on-time performance, but they don't pay fairly.  However, I'm not sure if the paid time off makes up for the fact that they don't pay you a lot for certain positions, but there are other positions you can move up to that pays fairly.  Provided refrigerators, big break room, clean environment.  Typically, it would depend on your position there to define your typical day but as a stocker your just supposed to stock the entire time by a certain time."
good,"There were people who slacked off and the ones that work hard would have to pick their slack up.  Overall, I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. I liked my job, but management q"
good,"Workload was dependent on the time of day and season.  During winter work was hectic due to holiday shopping, so there was little time to sit around idly."
good,give you the opportunity to make good money hard to advance unless you bust your butt. I check receipts and the customers are really rude because they feel its against the law or whatever
good,"Employees often had to pick up the slack of others, and cover jobs they were not trained on due to short notice call ins, otherwise day to day was stable and enjoyable as far as retail goes it was a pleasant year spent and health permitting id love to still be there."
good,"Managers can be a hit or miss but there are several opportunities to move up and the pay is pretty good and sometimes qualify for several benefits like health care, stock investments, 401k and several others. There is a walmart employee app so you can see your schedule for the next 3 weeks and we are offered a discount on most walmart items."
good,"Working at Walmart is easy, theres a lot of training at first and you don't really stop training considering you have to partake in online training, other than that its super easy environment to get used to."
good,Good fun to work and give unexperienced people a chance.  overtime always available and colleagues always seemed friendly. only down fall is the contract hours.
good,I loves working at Wal Mart. I was not a huge fan of being a cashier but it was fun to be a deli clerk. I like working with food and people the best becauaeThat is what I am best at.
good,"I would never tell anyone not to work for them. It's a great opportunity to learn and grow. There are so many different situations with it, if you are not an emotionally stable person who can deal with any and all situations it's probably not a good fit."
good,Not many job advancement options but the associates are great to work with. You meet all kinds of people that you can communicate and connect with. The workload is average.
good,El area de un ambiente laboral se crea apartir de la comunicacion
good,"Working in the deli/bakery department was great, the best department in the whole store. The department manager was very professional and helped where ever and when ever she could."
good,"They tried to work with me in regards to hours, the management was on site, and would often perform tasks when short handed. "
good,"Still early to form an accurate inclusive review. However, work values are high, management is understanding and flexible, and job benefits are not that high."
good,"I know there is a lot of things you need to know, but they don't let you learn new parts of the store. They only do it when they absolutely need someone in that position. I honestly think it is  a great group of people that you would not be disappointed with."
good,"Loved working there, no complaints. Worked both register and service desk and had a good experience in both areas.  Overall it was good only left to get more hours at another job."
good,Walmart can be a fun place to work sometimes stressful but over all they pay good and i would recommend it friends or family in need of a job that pays well.
good,Worked there for 12 years and was fired because of attendance   Only allowed 9 absences in 6month period  I had 8 and was told that I couldn't miss another day. I was late by 1-2 minutes in 2 days so they fired me because 2 days late they said was considered a day absence
good,Management can be hard on you at times for what the pay is but it’s nit hard work. It’s easier to work that day shift over the night shift. Some workers are lady and other workers are hard workers.
good,"Worked in sporting good as a cashier"
good,Coming to work on time ready to ring up customers greeting them and making sure they find everything ok. Ive had to learn that you have to stay professional dealing with customers who weren't so pleased about how certain employees handle there situations. Every holiday they were always celebrating. Keeping customers Satisfied. Meeting new employees.
good,"I worked at Walmart during the holiday season so the hours were really good, however a month or so after the hours were completely gone. I went from getting almost 70/ hrs a week to two 4 hour shifts a week & we got paid biweekly. Good place to work they’re super understanding, bad hours & bad point system."
good,walmart is a great company to work for...i had just come out of a divorce and the management and associates around me made me feel a part of a larger family that i was lacking...
good,Love working at Walmart because I love selling. I enjoy talking to people and making them feel comfortable in spending their money on glssses and contacts.
good,"From my experience of starting at Walmart i enjoyed it a lot. The benefits there are good mandatory breaks, a hour lunch period. The people who work at Walmart are open minded and always willing to help. I really loved the amount of training they give you your first couple days."
good,Walmart is definitely one of the best jobs for a first timer in the work field. You work with little supervision and it helps you grow as an employee whether you stay at Walmart or decide to move elsewhere.
good,"Walmart as a company is a great place to work if you're looking for something simple to do after graduating High School. If you wish to try for a higher position like management, they have courses that you may take to pursue that type of position. Depending on which store you go to, the management might not be the best, but for the most part they are nice and fair in their decisions."
good,"buena empresa, solo que los salarios son super bajos!!!!!"
good,"cashier, door standing, helping customer bring their items to their car. It was very busy, and they only open one or two cash registers so there is always big crowd. It made me fast thinker."
good,learn was machine also trained for many different position . Room for advancement . Slow work at times very busy during peek season . Mangers show favoritism
good,"Work harder than others and you will advance, but unless you can get to salary position you will max out pay quickly. But your benefits are very good."
good,"Walmart gave me several amazing opportunities to learn and expand my knowledge. I was able to promote several times while with the company. My career with Walmart allowed me to give my family what we needed and wanted. I have grown as a person, a manager, a peer, and it helped me be a better mother. I have a don't give up attitude and if something I do isn't good enough then I jump back up and try again. The only thing that is guaranteed in life is change, it is always happening and you have to be able to roll with the tide. I was affected by the last round of changes the company made and I am ok with it. This gives me a chance to again grow my knowledge and experience by starting a new career somewhere."
good,"Decent place to work, relatively nice people, biggest issue I had was that they didn't take into consideration that you were human and got sick. Flexible with your weekly schedule"
good,"Worked as a cashier and it was both fast and slow, some days it was dreadfully slow. Where as others like a weekend or holiday it was crazy busy. Very easy to get used to, management were nice and fun. Hours were competitive and some times you'll get 40 hours and others you'll get 20, just depend son performance and business."
good,Its a very fast moving environment. You have the opportunity to learn a lot in dealing with insurance processing and billing. I worked with a good group of people and had a great boss.
good,"At walmart , I worked as a cashier / Cart pusher / Maintenance / Unloader / Shipping and Receiving . I worked at walmart for 5Years . i learned how to use a cash register."
good,Family life is not in there message even though the say family first when it come to home life and health. Health benifits ar good. ..................
good,Working at Walmart can be kind of fun but if you don't want to spend most of time working then Walmart is not the job for you. Overall Walmart is a cool job.
good,"The work place is very fast and growing. I recommend working there, as it has good benefits. The management team is fair, but a lot is expected from their associates."
good,Pleasant environment with good benefits and training.  Employee discount a plus and works around school schedules.  Advancement is encouraged and supported by management.
good,Learned a lot about the retail business.  Got the opportunity to learned many aspects of the business.  Learned a lot from the many changes. Walmart gave me the experience that i have today which will open other opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work was usually long and hard, you get a list of needs from the manager and have to complete it by the end of the shift with little to no help. I learned how to do price changes, set modulars, and cake decorating.  There is a friendly workplace environment between associates."
good,It was an ok work environment. Management was going through a lot of changes while I was there so i cant really complain because the management that was in place did an ok job.
good,Good company overall that takes care of its people. A lot of opportunities for you if you’re willing to move around to get where you want to go in the company.
good,"Clock in ,  make sure frozen food need to be stocked . Put away truck load ,. Answer to customers request or questions . Do end caps , like what will be for sale coming up . Clean and straighten shelves in frozen ."
good,A day at Walmart consisted of unloading the truck and then sticking all the products When I was in electronics there was a lot more involvement with customers.
good,"Was a good experience for me,working  with new people helping people in the store,w as able to learn new skills like working in cosmetic  and learning about the way Walmart works"
good,It’s a good job to have if you are flexible with hours. Management overall could be improved! Employees are helpful and try to make the shopping experience great
good,Walmart is always busy. Management is pretty good. its a very easy job. Nothing about the job is hard at all. i like helping the customers find what they are looking for.
good,"Trabalhei por quase 2 anos lá."
good,"Was a great place to go into work each day, meeting new and old faces was fun.. I learned that any thing can happen when you work at a big retail store... Most management where easy to approach when you needed to talk. Everyone there was there to do a job and enjoy helping people. The hardest part of the job was leaving to get a full time job.. The easy part was picking up more hours when they needed some one"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, pero normalmente son un poco especiales para quien le dan el contrato"
good,A typical day at work involves clocking in and getting straight to work. You have to help customers and be able to do other objectives when called upon.
good,Great Company!! I have been with this company for a long time!!  I am wanting to move forward with a company that will enhance my expreience to the level the company needs.
good,"Busy,Fast Pace, Competitive, heavy lifting, Enjoyed working with the public and learning to bake bread, donuts and more. Stressful management. Interesting place to work"
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. Sometimes it's just really hard dealing with rude customers and sometimes even very rude and ignorant co-workers and management. However; I think Walmart is a good place to work.
good,"It always seemed to be a rush to get things done, I learned to have some respect for those who work in large stores like Walmart, management can be a little pushy but try to be nice and at the end of the day they just want the job done, I would say the hardest part is trying to be a perfect worker, trying to balance customer satisfaction/assistance and getting all of your tasks done for the day, is difficult especially on busy days. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing all of your co-workers (even as an introvert)"
good,"The job itself is rather simple, though I think you are expected to do more than a person is able to get done in the amount of time they give you to get it done. The people you work with is the best thing about this job and some of the managers are really easy to get along with. However there are so many managers with each one wanting the same thing done differently and it can get a little overwhelming. "
good,It was an overall great experience I love the people I worked with and enjoyed the wide variety of customers I got to interact with. Great opportunity.
good,Es una empresa en donde el desarrollo es muy complicado y los sueldos no son tan competitivos.
good,They were willing and able to accommodate for skills. You had the opportunity to work in multiple departments of the store. Great at working with complicated schedules.
good,Buen salario mucho trabajo y no pagan horas extras
good,Walmart has the best training when it comes to management. The workplace culture is welcoming. Its a very fast paced environment. You have to be willing in making your hands dirty even if you are in the management position. I have learned all kinds of trade from food to automobile.
good,Walmart is a great place to work especially it its your first job. There is a lot to do. They have great benefits. I have had the opportunity to work at 2 different stores. I currently work at the Galt store and the atmosphere is a lot better then the Sacramento store.
good,I worked at the home office for five years in the late 1990's when Walmart still had many of the original leaders that made the company great.  It is a huge company but is a great place to learn how the retail business works.  I enjoyed the culture and team atmosphere and understand that the culture is not what it used to be.  I'm not sure about that.  Great company to make your career or to leverage your Walmart experience to boost your career opportunities outside of Walmart.
good,I had a chance to develop my employee/employer skills.  I was able to advance to management.  I was allowed to develop procedures that were listened to and enacted by upper management throughout the chain.
good,Management is great. You get to know regular customers. Its hard to move up. Most times you work 9 hour shifts. The breaks are great you get two 15 minute breaks and up to a 2 hour lunch.
good,"Daily work basis consisted of meeting every customers needs/wants in order to keep them loyal. I learned to use MC40's, department programs, work a register, and how to speak to every type of customer."
good,"I worked nights and days. by far I will tell you nights are the worse. Really depending on you, but when I did work there. It was one of the best jobs I've had."
good,"Walmart was a good family place to start off work in, helpful with a family flexible work schedule. The hardest part of my job was dealing with certain associates not following there half of the rules of the workplace."
good,"Pretty fast paced, tons of people on holidays, you have to be quick before people start getting impatient, sometimes management isn't the best but things tend to go smoothly everyday."
good,Garden department and working in the back room gave me the most satisfaction.  Culture was pretty nice.  Spring bonus' were great.  Most enjoyable part again is the ability too move around different dept's.
good,"A typical day was me working on anything left over from my manager. Help customers, help other associates keep areas clean and organized, take inventory, and communicate with other departments about breaks and meal breaks."
good,"Walmart pays very well when in a salaried role. It can be very stressful at times and d mand is very high but they train you to a level above what you would get at most any other job. Learn, develop yourself and keep going with them. Don’t ever get comfortable as they are a continuously changing company and you have to keep your game up.  Only downfall to the co-manager position now is you have 2.5 years to move up, step down or leave the company."
good,I liked my job there management wasnt on same page they didn't bother me as long as we did our job got plenty of exercise good experience fast pace work
good,"My time at Walmart was fun and educational, I got to learn a lot in the time that I worked there. If you are looking for a job in the retail business Walmart is a good place to start."
good,"Great opportunity for for growth, change and advancement. Never have to remain in one possession if unsatisfied. Great management team that seemed to have a plan. Worked with my school schedule (college student) when making work schedule. Very little benefits or pay."
good,Wasn't the worst job ive ever had but needs some improvements. Managers often aren't trained the way the other employes are i worked there for a short period of time but i knew more than my manager.
good,Decent job with reliable and flexible hours. Available health care plans for associates and a management type that can interact with employees directly.
good,I was apart of a great opportunity to learn more in the automotive setting. It was a great learning experience. I now have a wealth of knowledge of automotive needs and of the general running of a walmart.
good,Aime faire mon emploie actuel aime aussi le service a la clentele
good,"Es un buen lugar para desarrollarse y crecer, existe armonía entre los compañeros lo cual hace más sencillo poder trabajar."
good,this is a very fast paced competitive environment if your not looking to work hard and at a fast pace this will not be the place for you must have a open schedule
good,"This is a great job for first employment, I have learned so many basic job skills working for Walmart. Now, I am ready to further my career and find more challenging work. This job requires face to face customer service, which was a great experience- learning to be adaptable to all different types of people"
good,"Walmart was an amazing place to work for. However, I feel that I was wrongfully terminated and discriminated against. A complaint I made towards a manager led to my termination although they claimed to have other reasoning."
good,Great company to work for. Great experience and family oriented atmosphere. I would recommend this company for anyone looking to advance in retail....
good,es una empresa que te da la oportunidad de laborar con ellos y la capicidad de desarrollar y subir de puesto
good,Great place to work for individuals who like to build and cultivate customer relationships.  Getting to interact with clients to help preserve and share memories.
good,"People are fun as long as you are productive and get the job done. "
good,"I would recommend them as a great stepping stone for people who want to move father in a company, I learned a lot there and am glad that my coworkers and mangers helped me get far"
good,un bue ambiente laboral accesible y buen pago laboral
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. You do meet a lot of people coworkers as well as customers  management were good depending on what department and store you work at
good,Great pay cool staff pay raises good benefits. I mostly worked 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week. 10% discount is nice as well just you have to work for 3 whole months to get the discount.
good,Working with the the public and getting to know cool and interesting people were the highlights of the day. Management tried to help out anyway they could.
good,Walmart is just an average job in my opinion it isn't great but it isn't terrible.  i you do your every day job well you can move uo in the company. It's overall an decent job i you're working hard.
good,"i enjoyed the job, the pay was decent, the hours were good, but even with years of experience i couldn't get promoted. They preferred promoting people with less experience."
good,"Walmart is a very quick-paced place to work, with many opportunities to challenge your skills.  Associates deal with customers, work with merchandising, stocking merchandise and register operations.  As a manager you could be making leadership decisions, planning business, running register or stocking freight on any given day."
good,"Honestly, I would probably still have this job if I wouldn't have had to keep talking to management about staying above 25 hours a week. My coworkers were great, and other than the scheduling conflicts, managers were easy to work with."
good,Minha 1 experiencia foi satisfatória para quem nunca tinha trabalhado com caixa de supermercado.
good,"I started like probably a lot of people. Its temporary, I won't stay long. Well almost 8 years later and I am still here."
good,I am at Wal mart now and enjoying it but not getting full time hours and I am looking at moving to Guelph. A good job but i am just moving ahead in my future goals
good,"The management was not very friendly to most of the employee.  It was an okay to place to work, with some friendly employees.  Ran the register and always wanted to learn a different department but never got the chance."
good,A lot work no good pay and some times long hours worked for day and need more good attention to the workers and bring all material needed for work
good,"Quick paced environment"
good,good place to work. always have to be on task. management is decent. a lot of different ways to grow in the company. overall a pretty nice place to work
good,Había muchas personas que se sentían con el derecho de poder entrar y mandar en el área.
good,"The supervisors were for the most part good to work with."
good,Not enough time in a day for the work load at Walmart. Very stressful atmosphere. The management team were not always willing to work with you. The lack of equipment hidden by upper management and associates made it hard to complete task.
good,"Foi uma experiência muito importate para minha vida pessoal, que me abril as porta para o mercado de trabalho."
good,Great environment with good sales associates with great flexible hours to work.although there are many flaws within the employ system it commutes itself very well in order to keep associates ready and available for work.
good,I learned how to spot theft from customers.  A typical day at work is normally slow until you get lunch and dinner hours.  Some management were kind and polite.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers.
good,Walmart was a great place to work. They had great benefits and programs for savings. You could advance in the company with hard work and dedication. Not too many bad things I could say about the company.
good,I had fun work there but again i was young and fresh out of high school in college. They do allow you to earn a spot to move up in your career there but I wanted more moeny.
good,"I worked in Fairbanks, Alaska the Walmart's employees wages there are higher. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and management was really nice we all got along. There is only one Walmart in Fairbanks, AK"
good,I never had any issue with Wal-Mart. I was no longer able to work the hours and they weren't able to work with me on it. It's understandable. The Meat Department manager is great.
good,Good fast paced work environment I worked in 2 sections such as cashier and cap2 truck unload both is quick paced and great to work I would do it again if I could
good,"The attendance policy is very unfair, in this day and time when you have the flu and bronchitis and unable to work with, with two doctors excuses, you are allowed only 3.5 points (absences)and it takes 7 days to get over it running a fever, then I don't understand how it cannot be excused."
good,I love my job was very easy i just dislike how customers treated empolyees if u ever work for a place like this stay to yourself Everyone that you work wit is not your friend keep it sbusiness only
good,"My time at Walmart was exciting I enjoyed meeting new customers and working with the employees , It was always a new lesson just a different day. I loved my job at Walmart."
good,"We actually stretched before working, then talked about what we had for the day, and where we would be at. I've learned a lot about management skills from my manager. Everyone was so nice to each other unless they where having a bad day. They always had to help each other out to get things done. The hardest part of the job was throwing a truck, the low item count trucks where the easiest, then getting 3000+ item trucks took two hours of consecutive throwing. But it was an amazing free workout. Sadly to say I still loved throwing the trucks. I had a weird work schedule since of college but on my days off I would come in and help with the truck by either throwing it or be on the line."
good,"As long as you do your job you're ok. I prefer the overnight shift, calm and less stress. Just like any other job, some managers are nice and some are corrupted and VERY difficult to work with."
good,"i absolutely enjoyed working at the Wal-Mart location that I did. They were understanding when it came to my school schedule and the loss of a family member and that was extremely appreciated. In return that made love my job and work hard, you get what you give."
good,"Walmart Being my first retail job challenge me on a different mental level which made me stronger and new ways and help me grow as a person.  Although working there was nice in its on way you have the people that want to see you fail and it can be your Assistant Manager, Store Manager even your peers that surround you but when you work retail you learn that you have to worry about yourself and always have a back up and keep proof of all your work pictures time stamp and date and how long you took to finish because lies and the truth always get twisted and only you are able to make what's real against what's false by filing and keep  documents"
good,"The size and scale of the business is incredible.  The scope of my current role is very large and has a tremendous amount of impact on the stores, Associates, and customer experience."
good,"Typical day starts with a survey of the outside of the store, noting anything requiring attention for follow up."
good,"Some jobs have a certain way of doing things......""one best way"". Ours gets missed up soon as we clock in. There's never MC40s (which is needed to do our jobs), but higher management will not buckle down and make people turn them in so the next shift can use them. Then management will have you work on something else instead of sticking to the policy of ""one best way"". In the end of all this, the big problem is later on they'll want to know why you didn't get your processes done. Then you have to remind them they wanted something else done first, or you didn't have a MC40. So it's either do your process first (like your suppose to according to home office) and get in trouble cause you didn't get the special stuff management wanted first. Or forget process and do what management wanted then you're still in trouble. We have several ""managers"" and each one thinks their request is more important than the others, which causes a problem. They don't communicate to each other, so they don't know what all is already going on. While you're trying to do one thing for a manager, then the other comes up then you're in trouble cause you're not working on theirs. I'll admit with all the chaos and non-organization, I would really miss a lot of the people I work with and some of the customers I've grown to know."
good,Overall it was a good company to work for. I went in and worked my heart out for the first 3 years and was promoted to a higher level of management and then after 18 months in position i was told that the company was going to do a restructure and my position was being eliminated. I was given 2 months to find another position in the company or take a severance package of 11 weeks pay.
good,"I enjoyed my position, but sometimes it was stressful. Pushing myself to ensure shoplifters were caught, just to have them released to return the same day or week to try again. The benefits made it worth it for a while, then I needed to pursue other options."
good,"I have come across some really nice people  ,but some how I feel like management just don't care about your life outside of Wal-Mart. So for that reason I will only encourage school kids to apply to Wal-Mart"
good,"Great company to work for.trying to do the best for customers .it's a typical day at work. "
good,"fiquei pouco tempo como jovem aprendiz mas aprendi muito com essa empresa, como foi meu primeiro emprego sai de lá com muito aprendizado."
good,"Walmart can be what you make of it.  It can be a fun casual environment if that is what you choose.  However, to make it into a serious career then you pretty much have to dedicate your life to it.  I enjoy my work there most days, but there are other days that I wonder if this is worth it.  I've already decided that upon my leaving Walmart I will miss the people the most."
good,Ofrece estabilidad laboral y oportunidades de crecimiento.
good,"A GM retailer going through transformation."
good,Family orientated company that was very compassionate and accommodating with me concerning my elderly sick father. Offered overnight hours during my time of need. I found this working environment to be very enjoyable with my family circumstances and relieved stress. The hardest part was readjusting my internal clock to overnight hours!
good,"Not a terrible place to work. Pay is good. This job just was not for me. Benefits are good. Great co-workers. Production can be hard to meet, but you just have to find your groove."
good,i started early in the morning .. i liked my job doing what i did do to circumstances i had to quit working there  . the hardest part was management everybody told you different thinks .
good,"Okay place to work, but not much room for advancement.  "
good,"Very fast paced environment, very few breaks. Typical day would include cash handling and merchandise scanning, assisting customers with their needs and helping them find certain items. The hardest part would dealing with unhappy customers."
good,"The workload depended on how busy the store was that day. You have be willing to put in the work to get your job done. I worked in the apparel department, which was constant work."
good,Maintained and fixed all displays and shelves. Cleaned and organized backroom to ensure the safety of the workplace. replenished merchandise and stock as needed.; returned misplaced items to proper sections
good,The opportunity for growth is limitless in Bentonville and in retail stores.  Changes in leadership will move the company into eCommerce business and create a new way to shop.
good,In Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you end the college but if you have a family the salary is very low for the basic basket so is just to live with what is.necessary
good,"I worked for this company two times. The first time was in the late 90's and was still under Sam Walton. I could not have been happier with the company. The second round with this company, however, was a much different experience. I was in the middle management teir and came to the realization that the company was too big to grasp how to treat people anymore. On more than one occasion I was critized for helping the customer as a member of management! Perhaps the company has lost sight of some key values that it originated with."
good,"I advanced very quickly with the company, however with it constantly  restructuring I have been displaced twice in a little over 6 years. I would go back in the future when they are more stable in there upper leadership roles.. "
good,The company treats all employees equally and fairly. They allow two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. They were flexible and understanding with my schedule.
good,"wal mart is okay. just cheap on the pay and hours. some people in management are mean and liers. best to stay to your self n be quit to keep your job,"
good,"The pros are that you have a wide varitey of people that you get to meet, talk to, help find something, or see. I loved the stories I would hear from customers about how their day was going, or what their son/daughter did that was silly last night. I had grown to know my regulars and looked forward to them coming in the next time!"
good,I enjoyed the experience. Some managers however like to abuse there power and take advantage. I really loved helping customers but because of some bad apples customers would be angry and upset.
good,Depending on the shift you had you would be told to do different things. Early morning/ mid mornings would usually would put the freight away and then everyone else would help clean and then after that everything was pretty laid back
good,Working at Walmart is hard but also fun. my manger is great to work for she has taught me alot. stocking you are basically in charge of yourself which is a plus to not have someone watching you all the time you can just focus on your work. overnights are hard but the pay is good
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time at this job. It was easy to learn the basic concept of the position. Management was nice, although sometimes hard to reach. Overall it was an easy job that didn't require to much of you. The only hard thing was orientation which involved a lot of reading, testing, and memorization."
good,Walmart is a good work environment. At times it felt kind of cliquey and like I was back in high school with the gossip. I typically stayed to myself and focused on my work
good,"unloaded the nightly truck,took pallets to the grocery floor, down stacked freight from pallets onto carts, stocked, rotated and faced the grocery aisle shelves"
good,"Fairly good job, can't really complain. Could be better pay and hours but will still pay the bills. Options to work in different parts of store helps you chose what you want to do ."
good,"Company provides many opportunities. I started off as a Cashier 10 years ago, and what was at first just a job turned into a career. I have been fortunate enough to work at that Corporate Office in Bentonville, AR and have had the pleasure of meeting the CEO."
good,"Wal-Mart has been my life for the past 13yrs. Due to recent cuts in mgmt I have decided to pursue other options for me and my family.  The company provides great benefits, but lacks a balance of work and home."
good,"Same work everyday, easy to get fast at and not much change day to day. Work is easy there's just a lot of it to get through in a work day. Staying late to finish is a drag when it happens."
good,"No overtime if you are full time, shift depended on the day,  environment was light and upbeat, managers were good, pay was low and no raises when I was there, job was fun."
good,a typical day at this job would include driving a center rider around the warehouse as you listen to a headset to tell you which isle/slot to go to and the quantity of the item to be picked.
good,Better pay more hours on a typical day I going to my office start pulling out bags out of the recyclers going in entering in open the bags a separate everything that's in there do the cash do the checks do the WIC do all reports put reports together put them in the slots have manager sign them
good,A typical day at work consist of greeting customers and interacting with them through out the day. I learned cashier skills and money handling. Management was laid back and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is being a people oriented at all times. The most enjoyable part is helping out customers.
good,Management was bad. lots of drama between people at the workplace. communication was poor. job culture was good cause you get trained in many areas of the store but they never keep you in any one place.
good,"Your work day will vary from day to day. Never a dull moment. Fun coworkers, management is so-so. Health care is good, discount on purchases, paid time off, paid holidays. But hectic around the holidays. Can be stressful."
good,"With the job position I held as a CSS the job was very active and fast-paced. There was always something to do when the flow of customers would slow down. On a typical day, I would get change for registers, answer questions, help customers, and sometimes I would even help new managers become familiar with our cash office and front-end equipment."
good,I liked this job as it help me have alot to learn from and it help me grow. Also alot of opportunities to grow with in the company with out leaving to another job.
good,Work is quick paced and stressful because constant pulled away. But I learned how to manage a department besides the bad managers. But very enthuastic and very up beat and happy even with problems on our plates. The hardest part is trying to stay on task without managers pulling you away. Although besides that I have enjoyed my work as well from time to time. Like making friends at work with employees and employers as well but of all I enjoyed seeing customers happy.
good,"It is a decent place to work. Great benefits for full time workers. No benefits for part time. The work isn't mentally difficult but can be very physically demanding. Walmart host a lot of dinners/lunchs for their workers at certain times of the year (christmas, easter, fund raisers)."
good,"Dealing with customers was the most difficult part of working at Walmart. Ive learned that the customer is always right, even when they aren't. And when they aren't, make sure they somehow get what they want without losing the company money. Very stressful job with management expecting you to deal with everything yourself. Ive learned how to become a kind hearted yet have a strong-arm when being a supervisor of about 50 people. I enjoyed my coworkers that I supervised because they listened to me without attitude because they understood that I was superior over them."
good,"Great experience and company with great benefits, compensations, and time off. Walmart is a great company to work for great experience that helped me learn and grow to the person I am today."
good,Retail environment is always changing and even more so now with ecommerce. Hard work daily but financially rewarding. I learned much in my experience.
good,"Do your Job. But no goofing off at least not to the extremes. Try to have fun, sure it's a work place, but it can be chill and relaxing. And try not to let management intimidate you."
good,"A great place to establish a career in retail, particularly in a management role. There were several levels of leadership in each facility enabling each level to demonstrate their areas of expertise in their role."
good,The volume of customers who frequent this store is huge and keeping the store in top order was continually challenging as many of the folks who shopped had very bad housekeeping etiquette and left things just about any and everywhere.
good,Work over the Christmas holiday.  Job was seasonal.  World recommend the job to anyone.  Family friendly environment.  Need to give people more chances for employment
good,"I love the Walmart workplace. I do not, however; like our particular manager. He does not follow the 20 minute food chain limit. He leaves things out of the cooler for hours at a time. He also disappears for large amounts of time, gives all the associates his work, and talks to everyone and does nothing."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart wasn't very difficult the managers and supervisors were great friendly people, and the work isn't extremely demanding. Just like any job you have tasks and deadlines Wal-Mart is fair with their my guide system which tells associates the allotted time for assigned tasks. The managers can help with issues concerning conflicts between life and scheduling most of the time but other times they will deny any help or simply ignore that you ever contacted them. But as we are all humans so are they. Overall, with many points taken into consideration, being a Wal-Mart associate is an easy going stable career in a great environment."
good,"This job was a four day work week, we had three 20 minute breaks per shift that were paid breaks. Work pace was fast and work load was heavy more than 85% of the time. Management would ride you hard if your lines got backed up but often wouldn't assist to help get caught up causing your other tow of three lines to end up getting backed up. Management did a reconfiguration of the lane sets and made it worse than it was before, putting three of four of the heaviest line in the same set for a loader. Left work every day feeling like you had been run over by a tractor trailer."
good,The days were very long and stressful and I usually had to pick up shifts because other employees didn't show up for work. The managers at Walmart were great and easy to deal with.
good,"Good organization to work for in the building stages of operation in the Charlotte area. Improvements can be made within the culture, processes and management."
good,"inventory management accuracy, insuring supply counts and ordering are done correctly on a daily basis through an automated inventory management system. I also manage and participate in annual inventory preparation."
good,"Je ne suis plus presentement chez Wal Mart, mais ce fut une joie de travailler a cet endroit.Une bonne esprit d équipe, il a fallu que je quitte apres une diminution des mes heures."
good,Working at Walmart helped develop my work ethic. The culture was fun and we used to compete to get our work done. The company also promotes from within. Definitely a great company to work for.
good,i was joined as a part time cashier in Wal mart April 2015 working over year that position lots of fun working with customer and move up to the customer service manager in July 2016 working that position in over years.
good,"A typical day at walmart has you in every department, several times. Looking for products for customers and helping them carry things to their car. The hardest part of the job would probably be just the heavy lifting."
good,"When I was hired on then management team was transitioning so many of my older coworkers were forced to take Walmart's pathways training. Since I was new I did not care that I had to take the training, however I do believe the computer training is too impersonal and some people may learn better from hands on training. I was in personal for all about three days, and then I was ready to ""shadow"" or watch another cashier do their job. To be honest I hated the shadowing as they made me do this for three days, all the while other cashiers that were hired alongside with me already were on the registers by themselves. instead of giving me cashier codes to operate a register they made a courtesy clerk, mind you this was middle of the summer 100+ degree temperatures outside. May be good to note that I being a male was forced outside to push carts instead of my female coworkers. My manager straight up pulled me aside and told me that no one else wants to so I had to. I didn't complain as a job is a job, just it took two weeks of cart pushing to finally get my codes. If you are young male seeking cashiering job at Walmart expect to do more than cashier, as I was Cashier/Courtesy Clerk/Stocker/Truck Unloader."
good,"the work environment was very fast faced and loud, the people were great to work with and for, but the pay at the time was not what i wanted. i needed something more stable"
good,"Upper Management has a set plan of the work force for job tasks - Middle Manage has their own plan on how they want the tasks to be performed. Upper Management is not aware of what of the unsound Middle Management dissensions - Not working hand in hand as far as the guidelines of set protocols,"
good,"Wal-Mart has a very competitive starting rate for newly hired hourly associates,as well as excellent entry-level management pay.There is a continuous in service or on the job training for every employee to keep each and everyone abreast with the ever growing business needs and dynamics and finally,there is a clear pathway for career advancement and yearly wage review,tied to job performance."
good,J'ai bien aimé le service à la clientèle. Je me suis impliqué dans le comité santé sécurité.
good,Environnement de travail très agréable. J'ai bien aimé le service à la clientèle. Je me suis impliqué dans le comité santé et sécurité.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart isn't as bad as what some, or most, people would assume it to be-- At least when I worked there. Fellow associates are very chill and relaxed, I made a good few friends in the workplace. Customers can be really grateful for the help you display, and I mean that in a honest and positive way."
good,Run the register greet and thank the customer clean your area always have a smile on your face assistant the customers in there needs be fast but make sure u bag the groceries properly
good,when I first started working at Walmart I was happy and excited to start my day and be around different kinds of people. I was energetic but not anymore.
good,"standing on feet for 8 hrs. a day hardest part of job"
good,"Wal-Mart as a company was very rewarding for me and felt like a great place to work, but what kind of experience you will get from it can all depend on what kind of management team you have to deal with. What I mean by this is that no matter what you do in the job place it will all come down to the type of management you have running the store that will determine how you will enjoy or dislike the company. It was very hit or miss for me over the years I was employed there, sometimes a new manager is hired and you'll have a good run for a few months before he is relocated and then you end up with a complete opposite person leaving you dreading to go in to work due to the fact of this evil incarnation."
good,"Fast pace good people to work with "
good,"i worked in the shoe dept at walmart as well as helped in the shipping dept when help was needed for very large shipments "
good,Working at Wal-Mart helps pay the bills.  The jobs are pretty easy and as long as your management team is good you won't hate your job.  I wouldn't recommend is as a career unless you enjoy retail.
good,I enjoyed my time while working for Walmart. The staff was a family atmosphere even though it was stressful at times it was also fun. Walmart offered job advancement and made resources available to all associates. Walmart offered competitive pay and benefits to  both full-time and part-time employees.
good,"Most of the people here are friendly but this Walmart was very gossipy. Almost everyone talked about everybody, it was almost as if we all went back to school to meet friends , to talk about them."
good,"You work hard and help customers. And you also work as a team, support each other. At least at my store management treat the employees very good with lots of respect and support."
good,.Great Work and Pay
good,Been working there for almost 8 years and still not making enough to support myself and we have lots of benefits if you can afford them. I was promised a big raise to be a department manager and 2 years later haven't seen it. There is a lot of stress to my position. Without much support from management.
good,"I appreciated the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the retail industry.  Walmart gave me experience in dealing with people and in merchandising products; both valuable skills to have as I move forward with my life.  "
good,"The pay was pretty good, but as far as training went, we were not given the  proper  tools to succeed. I think I would have really loved this job had I been trained properly."
good,"Typical day at work was productive and nice seeing happy employee and customer. I learned how to run the register, stock shelves. Management was nice."
good,This was the first time I had the opportunity to be a supervisor.  I learned a lot from the management team at the Bluefield Wal~Mart.  Teresa Harrison was very strict and push me to be the best I could be.
good,"During my time at Walmart, what I enjoyed most were the personal relationships formed with co-workers.  It felt like a family.  They were very understanding as far as learning and taking on new positions, and they promoted moving up in the company.  Management at my particular store was spread thin, which created an unsatisfactory work environment at times, and some associates were overwhelmed with extra work-load as a result.  Overall, though, my experience was generally positive."
good,"How to handle cash, work registers, properly greet customers. Working here at walmart is a fun but also  a fast paced enviroment. Majority days you will be busy doing something rather its scanning customers items or organizing your register."
good,"A typical day consisted of being briefed on our job for the night  getting started with our work, I learned all the product locations and isles in the store."
good,"Working for Wal-mart is a great job to make ends meet, but the managers there are sometime lazy on their job. You're fellow associates become like family to you.  The horrid part about it is rude costumers."
good,"My day at work is alright, i get to work at 10pm and start stocking and unlaoding pallets. "
good,"Walmart strives to be the best experience for the individual.  Take pride in all that you do and do this to the best of your ability. "
good,The only complaint I have about this job was the managers lack of understanding when it comes to life. They didn't seem to care if you had kids and or if an emergency came up.
good,working here is fast past and fun. co-workers are friendly and helpful. aver all a great place. the store was clean. the work was fairly easy. hardest part of the job was keeping up with the past but was also a fun experience.
good,"Most people you will encounter are amazing and will give the shirt off their back. There are some however that harm the overall culture. there are some small annoyances that they have recently introduced, like they changed our 5 minute clock in window from 5:00 AM to 5:05 AM, and gave us only 2 minutes from 4:58 AM to 5:00 AM."
good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar,paga em dia os seus funcionários empresa de grande porte."
good,Bem focada e objetiva no crescimento de seus colaboradores.
good,"Walmart is a good starting point company. They provide some of the highest pay for hourly jobs. You generally don't get set hours unless overnight, which can be stressful. But if you can work with people being human and the inconsistent schedule, then its a good job. Benefits, higher pay, chance to advance, raises, and earned paid vacation even for part timers."
good,"People talk. And try to hurt each other for personal reasons and advancement. Not an  ideal work place. PTO time available. adds to it every payday depending on how long you have worked there. Insurance is cheap, deductibles are high, life insurance 100000 paid by company. Life, health, dental all prorated. Better management would result in a more relaxed workplace. Overall I do not hate my job.Just wish some things were different to create a happier workplace where people want to work."
good,"this is a fast paced environment. sometimes so busy there is a lot of miss communication between workers, managers and store manager. i like the original culture but i think they kind of lost what that was or should be. the customers on the other hand are awesome for the most part. i have always enjoyed helping people."
good,the management was not always the best but the environment was awesome and my three years spent there were great! working with money and having regular customers was definitely a great feeling.
good,I learned how to handle customers with a positive mind set. I learned how to better engage with the associates not only to get better work results but to also learn about the associates to develop a go work relationship.
good,"Room to grow, not stressful enviroment. Plenty of work to do."
good,"Good place to work. Warehouse sucks. Transportation dept was nice place to work. Good bonus nice vacation days. Never had problem asking for off. "
good,Walmart is definitely a good place to work if you utilize the tools and connections that you'll gain over the course of your career. I would recommend this job to anyone as long as they don't plan on being stagnant and is willing to become proactive instead of reactive.
good,"Great benefits quarterly bonus. "
good,the workers are great but work can be slow or cut throat depending on what day it is in the distribution center i worked as a loader loading trucks all day that job sucks you dont want that job cause work is neverending over therer
good,I always did what was asked and kept myself busy . Walmart is very fast paced and your main goal is to keep the customers happy while the save money and live better
good,Production is well worked by associates but the communication between management and associates could be a little better. Understanding of or policies needs to be followed. Such as our return policy. Our policy needs to be enforced more on our customer receipts and a better return time frame on our policy board at our customer service.
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with certain customers. I learned a lot about working with a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find what they were looking for.
good,No comment at this time. I still work there. I prefer to say like any company there are good and bad things about it. I've worked there almost 12 years. I've seen many changes. It has many good things she some not so good.
good,"I handle checks, SSNs, money transfers, calls, and bill pay everyday. A typical day in the Money Center consists of cleaning the counters, organizing paperwork, putting out complimentary pens, and assisting one hundred to about two hundred customers in a day. I enjoy customer service and I enjoy working in a bank setting. I have learned everything I know from my training at Walmart and would like to take this knowledge with me to something greater. The most enjoyable part for my job is building the relationships with my coworkers and my clients. I like to get to know them, learn their names, and this helps me to assist them in better ways. I feel putting the customer first is the most important thing in any customer service job and Walmart has taught me this."
good,Some people were difficult but not a bad place to work. Gave decent insurance and a fair discount in store. Hours are crazy for sure. I worked in the tire and lube.
good,"As a whole I enjoy working at Walmart we are a family that goes through ups and downs the good with the bad. As the supervisor I love to give the team motivation under stressful conditions when they don't have energy or feel like a failure. because other members of management decide that it will be a micromanaging day which does not happen as often as people like to think. "
good,"-fast paced"
good,It was alright working at walmart the benefits was nice but the pace was a little to slow. seemed like it was killing my brain cells so i had to find something else that required more movement and more thinking
good,each day we would work freight from last night's truck and replaced any TV sold. once that was done we would zone up aisles and help customers. most of the shift you could be on register or answering customers questions.  I've learned that you come across all different types of people from ones who are clueless about products to ones who know everything about the department. management worked with you if you had any issues with work and helpful at times. the hardest part of the job was trying to be multiple places at once the most enjoyable part was satisfying customers by helping them with their needs.
good,No consistent with processes. Can be frustrating. Stores are also very unorganized which can make the day very long and problematic. Very flexible with time so its a win.
good,"After 10 years at Walmart i went part time and my hours became less and less consistent."
good,A typical day for me was to clock in and go to the floor and take my place at whatever register the assigned me. I would work at the self checkout station helping customers as they needed it
good,the hardest part of the job is handling a rude customer. when you first start you have to do pathways and that takes about a few months to finish and if not completed you can be terminated
good,"Empresa oferece oportunidade de crescimento, e cumpre todas as regras trabalhistas e ética."
good,"I have learned a lot at it was a interesting place to work and kept me busy, everyday was a new learning experience for myself and I wish to learn new things."
good,The Most Enjoyable part About this job Is working with new faces and being able to gain experience in other areas Fast. Working for Walmart I've learned how to Manage time And employees.
good,"I was able to promote quickly with WalMart great Opportunites to promote, I would recommend Walmart to a friend to work there. I do have regrets about leaving Walmart should have stayed."
good,As with all warehouse jobs it is fast paced and at times hectic.  We start at 5:00 am and end at 5:50 pm. IF you do your job you are left alone and are fine.  Management does not over and are not badgering.  It is a good place to work overall.  As a weekend employee i do not receive any paid holidays.
good,"I enjoyed learning all the aspects of the optical field. I love to help people and educated them in what they needed to help them with their vision needs."
good,Walmart is okay place to work it has its ups and downs especially when it comes to the customers some of them can be quite a pain but overall its goos place to work and has great benefits.
good,fast-paced and friendly with great benefits-- promote and advance careers--can change between shifts/jobs for example i can work overnights/cashier then 6months later if i want to change to days and there is an opening that is good too.
good,"The Managers were great, learned food care, bakery care, stocking shelves, basic pallet jack operation, unloading and loading trucks, freezer procedures,"
good,"While the pace could be blistering at times, it wasn't a bad place to work. You could get borrowed to other departments, although I never saw anyone get sent anywhere they didn't want to go. There were a few people who had problems in their departments with scheduling; sometimes managers didn't seem to care if you had other obligations."
good,Typical day began with receiving stock and then placing on the merchandise floor in its correct area.  Workplace was laid back most of the time as long as work was  getting done and completed in a timely manner.  Hardest part of the job was not always getting along with every co worker all the time.  Most enjoyable in this job was getting to meet new customers on a daily basis.
good,"I worked there for 3 years and it wasn't all bad. Management however, is horrible. No one is ever on the same page, (upper to lower management) one manager would tell you to do one thing and the other would say that's wrong, and you would get fussed at for doing what the other manager told you. They definitely played favorites and didn't want to help you. I worked in customer service so I needed them a lot more than the cashiers and other associates. THERE ARE SOME GOOD MANAGERS THERE WHO KNOW HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE. "
good,I learned how to handle stressful situations as well as great customer service while working with the company. It has been a great pleasure learning how to move at a fast pace and meet so many different people.
good,"I liked when my customers would come in with smiles on their faces, and I was able do give them the best customers service I could give to each one of them."
good,I would have to do everything from help unload the truck to check in products. I would manage the team for an easy work flow. Help customers as needed and ensure everyone stayed on task. Mean while I would be building and moving features to help customers shop for the add or season.
good,"While I enjoyed the work that I did with this employer, a definitely had issues with my direct managers. The hours and/or days you work are not set or stable. Overall this is a fairly decent job."
good,typically on a normal day of work i get my work done and have to help others pick up the slack and they still get paid the same and only do half the work ive learned a good bit about customer service  using a line/conveyor belt and also learned how stock shelfs in grocery
good,"It's not crazy as some would say, you just have to be more motivated. Offers good benefits just my pay is a little low and I need more to live off of. My comanager is great though."
good,"When I worked here, there were good days and bad days. Sometimes, the store would be busy or getting ready for a visit from corporate and we would have to rush to get freight on the shelves. Other times, things were slower and we could work at our own pace."
good,"I had a great time while i was working there, loved seeing all the new items we got in especially around the holiday season, made a lot of friends while working there, but i was fired due to the fact my doctor put me on little duty restrictions for 2 weeks  for pulling my back"
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart dealing with the customers but some managers have no respect for employees and don’t take their job serious because they take advantage of their position.
good,"Working at Walmart offered stability while in school. A typical day involved stocking, working front counter,and wherever need was needed. Management was awesome. Really helpful and understood how to talk to people."
good,"Walmart isn't a terrible company to work in, it's just a matter of what store you're working in and where. I was fortunate, and yet, unfortunate enoough to end up working in a new store. This means there was a lot of test runs happening for this store when it came to the change of seasons and holidays. Add that to constant switches in management, management and supervisors constantly quitting and being switched to different stores, and the lack of communication in the store, and you get one big mess. Things weren't terrible, but they could've been much better. Other Walmarts that I've shopped in seem to have happier, more put together staff and management in their stores. I would say, be careful where you apply to Walmart, because the make up of the store and its management and employees can either make or break you."
good,I did not mind working at Walmart. Customers usually just want you to point them in the direction of something.  I ended up making some friends there.
good,Worked the Cash register and stood for many hours.  Stood long hours and bagged customers groceries and worked at a fast pace.  I could handle pressure when customer lines were very long.  I was very fast and customers would compliment on my great attitude and smile.  I am a people person and enjoy working with customers.  I am very alert and notify security if I see someone steal or do something that is not right.  I can handle pressure and lift very heavy objects.  I am healthy and take care of myself and do not miss work due to any illness.  I enjoy being a team member and work with others.
good,"It’s a great place to work. The managements are very friendly. Also, if there’s any issues you have you can speak with the personnel to address the issue."
good,I learned how to operate the machines at work. Working as a team is always fun. Best part of the job is interacting with the customers. The wasnt really a hard part.
good,Quit because they kept scheduling me when I had class and they wouldn't give me less hours even though i asked perisitantly if they would. i only wanted a few hours a week
good,Working at walmart was pretty competitive with other employees for advancement. There was so many bosses and you didnt really know who to go to or what policy really was. They where flexible with hours but you had to have weeks in advance notice to take a. Particular day off if you needed to. Very hard to get fellow employees to cooperate.
good,"i enjoyed working at Walmart a lot, they train you extensively before you start working, and they have a warm working environment, most Co-workers are very friendly"
good,Good job Nice management good discounts fun to work not stressful. You get days off paid and if emergency happens. Friendly co workers I get along with everyone.
good,"Cashier, check people through line and customer assistance, help in straightening areas around checkout register.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and helping people."
good,"Every day would normally start with returns, then go and work freight, help any customers that had questions, and take them to the item instead of just telling them where it is. I learned how to work even harder and harder every single day. Management was not the greatest, always talked to me about not being in my area, even though they never asked if I was helping a customer, which I was always doing. The hardest part of the job was with management. The communication was very poor. I enjoyed working with other co workers and zoning with them."
good,"Walmart is the perfect place for a first job. You're always seeing different types of people, some of which can be pretty strange. Management doesn't seem to be the best though."
good,No daré opiniones significativas de la empresa. Solo que cumple con la ley al pie de la letra.
good,"Stock Freight, will helping customers, and Zone department to make it look good for the customers. Pull freight run the stacker and electric pallet jack."
good,It was a nice environment and you had friendly employees as long as the mechanical field is what you are trying to do is a start and will get you prepared for the task
good,"C'est une bonne équipe, mais l'environnement peut être lourd parfois. Plusieurs employés se plaignent du manque de respect de leur disponibilités et du nombre d'heures trop élevé. Mais sinon, c'est une entreprise avec de bonnes valeurs. Somme toute, j'ai globalement apprécié mon expérience."
good,"I have advanced numerous times in this company,over the passed 4 years. Although I enjoy my job and I do very well in managing a large number of areas and people I don't feel my pay accounts for how many hours I work in this particular store."
good,"good workers, nice people, clean environment, management works with you, very fast environment, morning meeting daily, celebrate holidays, learn how to talk to customers."
good,"I started out as a cashier, though I applied for a CSM position.  I learned how to do several positions, and have since moved up to customer service representative."
good,Me gusta lo que hago es absorbente de subgerente hacia los siguientes niveles
good,I worked in the back part of the store in the Iventory dept. Gathering all the boxes and merchandise and putting things in the right spot on the right row etc
good,"Everyday there was something new to learn and see. If it was ways to get carts. Or ever doing WIC a different and faster way. An the best part is you get taught this from different people in the store from different place, back grounds, and cultures. An for a guy who was new they sure made sure I was okay all they time."
good,"MI evaluación en general para mi fue muy buena, tanto en mi aprendizaje en nuevos rubros. He aprendido a ser responsable en la vida que no es todo para la broma como creía yo. Me han enseñado a ser COMPAÑERO y poder compartir un gran momento con unos grandes que me enseñaron a ser las cosas y a que no me fruste cuando no me salgan, ya que de los errores se aprende. Un día tipico de trabajo en mi experiencia fue llegar después de un largo viaje (1 hora). Llegar cambiarme y ir a disfrutar del puesto que tenia, con muchas ganas todos los dias de saber y poder aprender nuevas cosas. Por ejemplo: como colocar los productos para que asi no se caigan y aumentar mi fuerza ya que algunos eran pesados y al principio me costaron, pero después con el tiempo me fui acostumbrando. La cultura general por lo menos en mi sitio en el que trabaja era de muy ambiente todos sabíamos convivir entre si y casi no había discusiones. Los mas difícil para mi fue el GRAN trayecto que tenia que hacer, ya que terminaba mi jornada laboral y tenia que tomarme 2 colectivos para poder llegar ami casa. A veces demoraba muchos mas debido a que había algún choque en la ruta y/o calle muy agobiante en otras palabras. La gerencia me tengo que sacar el sombre siempre me han tratado con la mejor onda y nunca he tenido ningún conflicto y/o discusión. Grandes personas tanto laboral mente como personalmente."
good,Had to work 10 to 11 hours without a lunch.  Production was to hard to meet.  Did not know how long the work day was going to be until you show up for that days shift
good,"I work in the Walmart vision center, working there has tought me a bunch of new experiences. Great people there, and many job opportunities. Working there is a great learning experience."
good,"I loved my job. I just wanted to be a stay at home mom. I worked with great people who helped me grow into a department manger, I just didn't like having that much resposbililty."
good,"They have good teams to work with. All of the workers are not taught well, and have to learn quick to keep up with the pace.The schedule is changed daily and not put in the computer correctly. The benefits are good, the hours are good and the pay is fair."
good,"To be honest I loved working there, the money I was making was fairly decent. I was glad I had the opportunity to work there. The typical day was honestly seeing something new. I learned what what people are actually like. Management was good and the hardest part were really the customers."
good,would arrive to work to see what the load from the truck had left if not to see what kind of stock was left from the previous shift and begin to stack and load freezer organize as well as keepm in order would help with back up cashier if needed and overload on customers
good,"Alot of hard work, if your not willing to work hard this is not the job for you. Long hard 4 days throughout the week but the money is worth it. Make sure you stay well-rested."
good,"Everyone I worked with was great, only issue was the lack of good management around the store. I had issues time to time  in my last department because one manager wanted one thing and another manager wanted things done another way."
good,Days at work we’re fairly easy and I learned a lot from management and the other associates there. The hardest part of the job was probably having to deal with the rude customers because they made you feel like you were always in the wrong.
good,There were always new people joining the Walmart crew and most of them were very nice. It was also usually very busy so there wasn't a lot of time to just stand around.
good,Hard working associated.  Rules change alot. Everyone is not on the same page. Clean and caring people.  I am learned alot on how to be a good manager.
good,"Good experience with customers, nice work environment for workers, very good if you're looking for a part-time position, managers is very helpful. Or learning new things from a company"
good,"Always busy and the day passes fast."
good,"I take pride in what I do at Walmart, and why some people feel the need to put down people who work at Walmart is beyond me. Most days, I actually look forward to going to work. I know that may seem strange to some people, but i honestly do."
good,"Great work environment, good group of co-workers. Really enjoyed the type of work that I was great supervisor,easy to work with. Would definitely work there again."
good,"Walmart is not only my go to store of convenience but, also a good flexible summer position. A typical day at work involves a lot of stocking, general maintenance of area and, of course customer service. Learned more about security than other retailers. Managers in demand but, knowledgeable, efficient and, productive.""WallyWorld"" is its own culture, never a dull moment. Hardest part of job getting and,staying organized. People are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,You have to put in a lot of work at Walmart before they give it back....and that's not always guaranteed.  Management is always under pressure to deliver more with less.
good,"Working with coworkers was one of the highlights of the day. I got to learn different backgrounds, and was able to work efficiently as a team. Rotating schedules were difficult to work around, and management was slightly difficult to communicate with. I really enjoyed bringing my personal style to the job daily by being able to celebrate seasonally."
good,Company was great with how they treated their associates. Valued customers and striving for excellence. Had great exposure to a fast paced retail environment.
good,was a very enjoyable day of work .relaxed with many job advances to obtain. enjoyed working with all my associates. worked with manag. and they worked with me. did all the receiving auditing when needed. runing forklift . unloading and loading product. loading pallet trucks and freight.thought is was time to retire and did. now I don't know. am looking for work in my field since I'm on social sec.etc can't seem to stay busy at home.
good,"a normal day at work is just that normal. go to work, have a pep talk, and get to it that's it. management all over the place but well kept. great place to learn about cooperation."
good,Walmart is a fast paced exciting environment to work in.  Walmart challenges you everyday to be your best and realize the rewards for it.  Walmart's associates work toward a common goals and work together to achieve it.  Walmart's benefits are very competitive.
good,Very stressful during holidays! Very nice customers! Sometimes working an eight hour shift you would only get ONE break! Managers would leave early the week of Christmas!
good,"On a daily based, I would be a cashier in which I would charge customers for their items. I would also help them locate items they couldn't find. It was a stress free environment during most of the year. Only stressful times was during the holidays."
good,"I had really good experience with them. I had great managers and really learned a lot while in pharmacy school. There are challenges faced with most corporate pharmacies, but overall I didn't mind. I only left when I was given an opportunity to work at an independent pharmacy."
good,It is what you make it to be. I have seen better culture. Hate to say it but favoritism does exist. Would be a better company if management were fair and more cheerful.
good,Dealing with customers in general can be stressful at times. Mostly the individual interactions will vary according to your department and their (the customers) needs. Walmart is a very competitive and fast paced environment with a strong culture of meeting needs.
good,I enjoyed it. I earned three promotions in six months. I enjoyed talking with customers while displaying Walmart products.  At one point I felt grossly underpaid for the work that I was doing.
good,ok place to work .just getting company started .had to leave because of father had health issues.gave nice holiday meals.nice clean building and new equipment.
good,I enjoyed being there the people i work witk was nice. It was always something to do. Would have like to moved up but didn't want to give ten years to only move up once
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the people with whom you work. Walmart employs many people and most are very enjoyable.  The most difficult part of the position was the ability to complete the processes in place in a timely manner that enabled one to balance life and work.
good,i loved walmart want my job back. managers are jokes. they need better ones. things should have gone better than they did. they care nothing for your family when you kids are ill.
good,I enjoy what I do at Walmart but the management is terrible. They do not care about their employees. They always make you stressed while at work. I do love working in produce though.
good,"I worked at my own pace, and trusted to work on my own. I liked stocking the shelves and making end caps. The manager trusted me in doing my job on my own. Some times I had to work to long in the freezers."
good,"I really liked working at Walmart. I was asked to become a shift leader only two weeks after being at the Tiffin store but I had been with the company for six months. I like working with the public and it is a great place to do that. I made lots of friends there that I still have even though I no longer work there. They were there for me like a family when my parents passed away and I really appreciated that. There sympathy really touched my heart and they accepted the time I needed off to grieve without hesitation. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone for a great place to work."
good,The pay and hours are not the best. They don’t have set hours at this job and the pay isn’t what I thought. You deserve more then you get. The people are amazing but the job is sorta sucky. As a company it stinks but everyone who works there are great people to be around.
good,"A typical day working here was what I expected my job to be like. Communicating with customers, reading and filling prescriptions. Working on the computer and at the cashier. The manager was awesome! Such a nice group of Pharmacist, never annoyed when you have questions. There really wasn't any hard parts of the job, it was just sometimes a little complicated when the computers would go down and we would get behind on prescriptions, but with such a great team of technicians we would always get caught up quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself. I really enjoyed it."
good,"Empresa  solida, mas poucas oportunidades de crescimento para quem não tem nive superior."
good,They have a good computer system for filling Rx's.  Up to date on drug information. It can be stressful due to high volume and lack of staff.  Customer service is main focus.
good,"More than happy to give you more hours.  Customers look to walmart for a lot of reasons, your job is to satisfy and help them save money.  At the front end working with customers can be a big hassle since walmart draws all kinds of crowds.  Management is willing to hear what you have to say due to the open door policy.  The hardest part about the job is the customers and popularity of the store.  The most enjoyable part is being able to meet the friendly people in your community."
good,"productive and fun workplace with so much opportunity to learn new things each and every day,and working with the customers is the most enjoyable part of the job, and the hardest were not having enough time to enjoy them."
good,It was fast paced and always busy in the jobs that I preformed. I had great hours.  I my latest supervisor and would recommend working with her at any point.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part. I just felt it was time for a change. My last position was HR Manager at the Northport, AL location.I needed proper training which was not provided to me."
good,Most of the management team was personable and took pride staff relations. Never a dull moment between experiences with both fellow staff and customers.
good,"sometimes management can be the determining fracture of how good a particular Walmart runs and employees treated ."
good,Customer service is top priority.  Learning new things every day and always challenging. I have met many people who have become like family. I treat people like I want to be treated.
good,Working at walmart easy. you just need to balance everything specially working with management. Sometimes you have to aggree what they want you to do.
good,"Everyday you were met with a deadline sometimes unobtainable, but due to the fact that managers are rotated frequently they don't have the knowledge to assess the situation as unobtainable."
good,Working as an order filler kept days interesting and fast.  It's not for the faint of heart.  You will move A LOT.  You will sweat.  You can career advance.
good,"just like shopping here, walmart is a good place to work as well. the job is a lot of fun and you always have something to do. the breaks you get to take are also nice."
good,I was at walmart 4 months as a unloader then i was promoted to Dept. Manager you have to be with them at least a year before they consider you for a raise but due to my work and the way i carry myself i was promoted in a short period of time
good,"tiene horarios muy comodos, y buen ambiente con amplias oprtunidades"
good,it was a very relaxed laid back easy going environment but still a very professional career it had many benefits to the job and many opportunities toi advance in position of your career
good,They don't treat people fairly.  And they have there picks they like and ones they don't like.  I think everyone  should be treated  fair and treated like they didn't do any thing wrong till proven
good,I got hurt on a job and they didnt recover for me when i needed help.. I couldnt walk straight for 2 mins i had to sit down some where i ask them can they change me spots..i work on the water ale for 3 mounths straight pulling out pallets it felt like slavery but i got the job done and soon as i hurt my self they fire me for slow performance
good,"A fast paced company always looking to be competitive. One of their primary focuses is Gross Sales, in fact, this is constantly updated daily for all to see. Work/Life balance can get a little blurry as production issues can occur at any hour of the day as they have a footprint in several countries."
good,"I liked working there, spent some time in almost all the departments. Some i did like more then others too, some are quick paced and some are slow and relaxing. Overnight stocking, cart pushing, and cashiering requires speedy work and freezer/dairy, mens apparel and garden is slower paced and relaxing. I was a flexible worker and got moved around departments, which may not be possible for everyone. I really enjoyed it though and its not a bad place to work."
good,"Great and very fast paced company. Daily customer service a must and priority everyday Monday thru Sunday non stop. You must  be very flexible and a quick learner on the job to be able to serve customers in a timely manner. You get lots of complaints about something everyday, Must be able to handle criticism from  customers. Sometime overtime is mandatory and must be available to work. Management is very strict and enforced. Sometimes it can be very stressful to deal with managers and very rude customers. The pay is not always worth for what you have to deal with at the company."
good,"Walmart has alot of benefits but it's also a quick paced job thats constantly busy, it has its slow moments but that is very rare. Has great benefits."
good,"Not somewhere you would want to stay to advance to a high paying position, but it does have some advancement to allow you experience to take on to another workplace"
good,I enjoy organizing & putting up frate so this job was perfect. I just believe it’s time for me to broaden my horizons & work at a more professional environment.
good,A place where you understand work community and are encouraged by college. Gives room for advancement within the organisation and safety of every staff in consider first.
good,Work environment was great with good colleagues around who always maintained competitiveness among the group and helped me learn new technologies as well.
good,It was an easy job. I worked part time and that worked well for me. The work times were not ideal but if its just your summer job or you really need to work you make do. I loved my management team.
good,The days at work were interesting you never knew who would come into Walmart and you'll see. Walmart gives you the opportunity to see people that you haven't seen in years.
good,"Work was typically decent during the day. I usually knew what to expect to be doing before I came in. It would depend on the manager, different managers have different styles. Not all of the co-workers are pleasant, but if there are significant issues there are protections. The work can be difficult and stressful at times, particularly if you're understaffed."
good,"It wasnt my worse job experience and I really enjoyed working with the company, they just wouldnt work with me as far as my schedule. If one day i feel the need to go back to a job i worked before it would be walmart."
good,loved working there loved how kind and friendly everyone is . I loved the holidays getting to work with all different  types of people and seeing all the neat merchandise that was displayed .
good,"It's good place to work, benefits are good, managed is poor, they don't think of their employers and not enough good ones that care for their employees."
good,"Walmart is a great company to for as an extra level to a career ."
good,Productive and fun place to meet new people and wonderful experience. I learned a lot about the remodeling of the store and floor planning.  I enjoyed working with different people and the experience was great!
good,Don't plant a target on your back. Once they know who you are they don't leave you alone and they will nit pick every little thing. once they find a good asset about you they will take advantage of you every time.
good,"Lugar bom para o trabalho,bons colegas sempre todos bem ativos participantes etc...."
good,Typical day at Walmart is no different than any other work place. Show up and stay busy. Follow directions and have patients. The pathways program for learning is informative and great way to learn the business.
good,A typical day would include stocking selves and cleaning up work area. After I was done with my own area I would normally go and help another person with their area.
good,"I like the work, people are friendly and great location for work. Some work nights were stressful but always managed to get my work done and be productive."
good,"Walmart gives you the opportunity to advance, In other words, you get out of Walmart what you put into Walmart. Most days at Walmart were enjoyable and most of the people were very nice."
good,A good company for making career. its a FMCG company to gowth career rapidly. In this company the environment of work is good and this company also helps to make career best
good,"I have worked at Wal-Mart for a number of years and it has been a great journey! I have learned a lot working there."
good,"A typical work day included managing my inventory, price changes, and customer service. I learned how to manager a department and my employees well. My manager was the best. He was very helpful with any questions I was unsure of. The culture usually wasnt very good. There was a lot of people that liked to gossip and talk behind peoples backs. The hardest part of the job for me was making sure that my people did everything that I asked them to. The most enjoyable part of this job was when i accomplished all tasks I set for my self that day, the feeling of accomplishment was nice."
good,It was an ok place to work.    Could pay more and have more benefits.  Need more staff.  It seems that we are always short handed.  I spend the day taking care of customers and stocking shelves as well as straightening shelves and building end caps or displays.
good,The managers at walmart took there jobs a little to serious but I learned to give 100 percent at every task I take on. walmart pushed me in ways I thought I couldn't be pushed.
good,The overall job was not difficult. Just wish pay was better. Sometimes management was not very good at communicating with the employees and showed lack of interest.
good,"Walmart has developed the mentality that it's customers are always right, even when they are stealing. Loss prevention is seriously slack, especially overnight. They portray themselves as a happy place, while their associates are overworked, stressed out, and unhappy."
good,"My typical day-to-day activities include managing the incoming and outgoing invoices for a total of 70 stores. I learned to multi-task, put the customer and companies best interest at the forefront, remove emotions from decision-making, how to delegate and be a leader. I've also learned how to manage relatively large projects under strict deadlines. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with people of various backgrounds, ethnicity, and beliefs. Diversity is what makes a company stronger. The hardest part of my job is knowing when to stop working and take a break because I take pride in the quality of work that I submit. The management team is very lax as we primarily work independently, but in some cases we must work on projects together. I love what I do. I get to come to work everyday and solve problems. I leave work feeling very accomplished because I know that what I do makes a difference for our stores. Individuals do not succeed, teams do. I am a team member of every store that I work with and even those that I am not responsible for."
good,"i enjoyed working for this company, sometimes the management can ruin it for the people they are supervising...like placing them in other departments without training"
good,What was good about walmart is the team work and the experience you gain with customer service. Most managers are very helpful. You also have the chance to learn every department with time.
good,"Fast-paced and very competitive environment to work. "
good,If your are in school this is a good place to be. Walmart will try and work with you school schedule. Make sure they put you in a position you love. Walmart try’s to keep it a fun place work at . A place to meet new smiling faces.
good,To be Wal-Mart is to be family. I have made friends there that I know I will always be close to. It can be crazy but you get to meet so many great people in your co-workers and customers and there are many life skills that the company will gladly teach you.
good,"A typical day at work: Fun but fast paced"
good,I got to help people that couldn't find the products they were looking for which in turn helped me to learn where things were in the store. I got to see the knew products that the store had to offer.
good,Wal-mart  is very team oriented. The compensation is very competitive in the field. The support structure within the company framework supports the associate.
good,"Very fast paced, learned I could not depend on some of the mgrs for backup. I loved the culture but disappointed in upper management."
good,"Most enjoyable = Customers and employees"
good,"It's A Good Place To Work If It's Your First Job Or You Like That Type Of Work Environment. They Give You Somewhat Of A Hard Time When You're New But If You Catch On To Things Quickly, Can Work At A Safe Yet Fast Pace, And Like Working Late Night This Is The Right Job."
good,empresa que busca el bienestar  de ellos siempre y deja a sus asociados en segundo plano para la toma de decisiones.
good,"Es una buena compañía ya que cumple con lo básico de la ley del trabajo,aprendí a desarrollar muchas de mis habilidades , a cumplir metas y fijar nuevos retos cada día, pero como en muchos casos en ocasiones las promociones de puesto no se dan en base al esfuerzo de los trabajadores sino en conveniencias mismas de los jefes o gerentes. En años atrás la compañía para mi era considerada como la mejor pero conforme pasa el tiempo empiezan hacer el trabajo mas pesado y exigente y el salario ya no es proporcional."
good,easy going/laid back/no real stress.Very comfortable and family-oriented.constantly stocking produce items and food shelves. customers are very encouraging and civil in our work.
good,You can transfer from one store to another store you meet a lot of people customers and employees you can be promoted to different areas within the company there needs to be more raises.
good,Working in the deli was slow paced but working with the people I did made the time go by fast. I had a lot of friendly co workers that I got along with but did not really approve of my manager. She didn't seem to understand the deli and wasn't easy to approach or talk to.
good,It's hard work and fast pace. My Clean Team Super is well Knowledge that what he has past on to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers I get to meet and help. The Hardest part of my job would be leaving the people I worked with for the four years at the store.
good,"Management was wonderful, I loved them! Very clean environment, awesome and helpful employees managers also helped at times. Discounts were good, and the deli was tasty."
good,You work with a supportive team. The management is willing to get involved and help out when needed. It is unique environment where you meet multiple different people. This situation teaches you how to communicate with different people. It also teaches you how to communicate with people in different situations.
good,A typical day at work is just work to me. I enjoy the work at Walmart. Its pretty fast-paced and makes the time go by faster. I developed excellent professional skills working for Walmart such as verbal and written skills. I love meeting different kinds of people in which I do. The hardest part of the job is wanting to advance after maintaining excellent performance and having to wait years and years for a chance to move up. The most enjoyable part of the job is stocking merchandise and helping customers.
good,"I enjoyed working as a stocking/floor associate for a couple of months and then moving to the back room to unload GM trucks overnight. "
good,It’s a nice job as long as you’re willing to work. Lack in pay though! Management was amazing. Hard to move to a higher position unless you have been there for awhile.
good,Muy bien la empresa la recomiendo mucho se preocupan mucho por él trabajador
good,"the position I withheld there made me fit right in, for I was in sync with most co-workers and got along with them as well. Working there made a positive impact my life, I actually wouldn't mind working there again."
good,"I started as an associate at walmart, I advanced quickly . They sent me for training to be an assistant manager for photo lab and connection center. Learned a lot. Was fast pace"
good,Management means to do any work in the best possible manner is called management .the hardest part of the job is to keep standing for 8 hours on your shift .workplace culture is good here in Regina .the most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with different culture people the most important thing i learned in my jobs to remains happy all the time have a smile all the time on my face
good,"Walmart is an awesome environment to work in, as long as you know how to get along with one another. If you don't like people, don't work there. Otherwise, its a great place of business and I wouldn't hesitate to work there again if I ever have to."
good,"every member of management would tall you something different, so wither the teachings or communication was off. the work wasn't hard but i was doing the work of a customer service manager and wasn't getting the pay"
good,Overall I liked while I was there but after a while I wanted to do something different and experience different opportunities. And I would recommend anyone to work there you just got to know how work as a team player.
good,"No real complaints. Standard office environment. Company puts major emphasis on how much time you put in, not necessarily quality of work. Very competitive."
good,"It was always fun walking into walmart...the store activity was contagious and I felt happy to be there.  The other employees were friendly and extremely helpful. The CSMs were usually fair and understanding, although there were some cranky ones every now and then...can't blame them. They have a rough job.  Many employees are not happy with their job there, but i enjoyed mine. Unfortunately, my back and knees began giving me problems so I decided to retire."
good,good pay for an entry level job. not sure if it was worth putting up with people not doing their jobs and picking up their slack. management just wanted a good face. they didnt understand the job
good,"unload truck,stock grocery"
good,"walmart is a a job where you can learn many management skills ,the enviroment is healthy ani enjoy doing my customer service duties. Management has always tried to be fair even when it seemed unfair."
good,"Lots of things to learn. I get to help lots of customers find products they want and to help educate them on the products as well.  I am able to help with the technical issues on the electronic products as well as how to use them with our photo lab.  On the flip side, it is hard to keep up with all of the responsibilities of Walmart customers and the photo lab.  Not enough staff to handle all of the customers and departments at certain times of the year.  It gets stressful when there is no extra help.  The positive side is that business is booming.  The flip side is that Walmart can use some more help and then it would really be a great place to work."
good,"Empresa multinacional,com falta de treinamento eficaz, falta de suporte a seus associados equipamentos precários"
good,It's overall a good company to work at. I don't understand why many other companies give Walmart a bad name... I have applied to other companies and they don't pay as much as Walmart in my area. I've learned a lot that could help me at other companies as well. The workplace attitude is just that either you get the positive people to work around or the ones that don't want to work or be there. I think I enjoyed mostly knowing that I had an impact on most of my customers and I know they will miss me dearly ...
good,"good job to start of with, good pay, hours are usuall 5 to 8 hours a day depending if your full or part time. can learn just about everything in this job."
good,"Really enjoy the people I work with. Seem to be team-oriented. Like all jobs in retail, it has it's down side. Management doesn't really listen to the employees unless you're a supervisor or fellow manager. Hours are irregular (i.e., close one night, open the following morning). May work close to forty hours over just a few days,then, the following week, only 16. This prevents overtime pay and benefits. Hardest part of the job is covering other areas because management forgot to schedule the necessary help or didn't want to dig into the budget for the manpower. Favorite part of the job is talking with the regular customers and bonds with fellow employees."
good,"A lot of movement all day, whether dealing with associates or customers. There is always something new that's implemented, so there is a lot to learn which is always good. Management is a mixture, because people manage differently. Workplace culture is great, just have to keep enforcing it. Working the long hours would be the hardest part for me. Not much family time at home. Seeing the smiles on the associates and customers faces is what I enjoy mostly."
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't the most fun, or interesting, but it is a decent job. Pay rate is just above average (slightly more then minimum wage). You get plenty of breaks, and management, while doing their job, isn't too strict."
good,"Orders usually ""drop"" during two different time frames. One around 5 am for the morning bunch of orders, and the second around noon for afternoon orders. Once we recieve the orders, we go onto the floor and find the items the customers want. "
good,"lmart I learn leadership ,patients, how to interact with others from different religion and back grounds I was taught to work under pressure even when sometimes i thought the task was to much for but i always came up with a game plan and got the job done everytime i had some good and stressful times but at the end working for the company shape me to be the hard worker and leader i am today."
good,"Walmart was fun to work at and most of the managers were fun to work with and around,i liked working for Walmart, I learned a lot of good skills while working there."
good,"Bonne communication avec les autres associés. J'ai appris à bien communiquer avec les clients, à être rapide pendant les heures difficiles et à travailler à la caisse. Bon management, horaires de travail flexibles. Je n'ai pas trouvé d'aspect difficile à mon poste car j'aimais ça. L'aspect le plus agréable est la relation avec les autres travailleurs et les superviseurs car ce sont des gens bien."
good,"lots and lots of heavy lifting. employees are very nice usually, the managers can be kind of iffy. you learn pretty quickly where things go and how to keep things organized."
good,"average place to work. not much intensive training.knew already about handling food. hardest part employee attendance, best, fast pace, and interaction with customers."
good,"I worked AP, long Hours.   Walked around the store and looked for Violators stealing.  Monitored employees to ensure they were not stealing.  Lots of walking."
good,"Each manager and each store is different, and it felt like things changed daily so if you don't like change not a place to work. Tough attendance policy."
good,Not a bad place to be if you're willing to come in do your job or whatever little tasks management might have for you. You have to be flexible about what you are asked to do on a day to day basis
good,"I didn't mind working for this company, had good communication with management. Good feedback very laid back environment. Work place environment was good, scheduling was good, hours were good. I didn't have many complaints about this company."
good,Not a job that I saw as what I wanted for a career. My job was being phased out and I was not interested in moving up due to family matters and other issues.
good,"Distribution center is quick paced and physical work.  No AC makes for long days. Good benefits and opportunity for advancement if you are flexible, degree helps."
good,"learned more new things and deal with new staff, new customers and patients new manager too.more challenging and im enjoying my work every day and like more busy to work"
good,"Restock shelves. Management was kind giving pointers on the job.I enjoyed working with the other workers. Facing, cleaning. climbing later downloading,"
good,"This position was a great step up for me from other positions within the company. It felt as if it were the most professional position within the company for an hourly associate. Management was great, but as a technician there is no room for growth once you become certified. Lead technician positions are available, but it is typically given to the person there the longest, and as a result someone who intends to be there for a long while; limiting the growth for other techs."
good,You had to always hussle to be able to get all of the customers out in a timely manner or stock the area that you are responsible for or unload the truck and stock the electronics department by a certain time. There was so slowing down or time to stand around and talk. That is what I liked about the position the most; that you always had something to do.
good,"I have worked at Wal-Mart for almost 17 years. There is plenty of room for growth as I worked my way up from cashier to Department Manager. The hours are not always what you want, but if you are willing to work and be flexible. It's a pretty decent job."
good,I started in 2011 .I love working with my co workers and the public .I would love if they would pay more for the amount of work that I pre formed .I need to move forward.
good,"I learned to adopt quickly to different pharmacies and patients needs depending on the area I was traveling to, from West Palm Beach to Miami. I greatly benefited from having to  assess and utilize the various needs of the diverse cultures I came in contact with on  a daily basis, both in reference to my patients as well as my coworkers."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. The hours were fair and my pay was good. Being a stocker was just enough challenging that I wasn't bored with what I was doing.
good,I'm not working at Walmart this present time. But when I was working there I loved it because I got to meet new people everyday and my co-workers were great.
good,Tappahannock walmart was a great working and educational experience with good pay easygoing environment but poor unorganized management and leadership
good,Working for Wal-Mart was stressful at times due to rude customers and some management. I learned to work with everyday changes and in different departments throughout my time there. The schedule was somewhat flexible only if you were able to work your way up the ladder. I've made Great friends over the years working there
good,I have worked for Walmart for 2 years and I enjoy my job.  I'm currently a service desk/money center associate.  At times it can be a little bit of a challenge however I enjoy my job.
good,The other employees were great to work with! I saw a lot of people I know when they would come in the store. I left to try my hand as a debt collector. Walmart was great!
good,"Walmart always seemed to have less employees then needed for the work load, In a typical shift, you were expected to carry a full work load, finish what the previous shift did not, help in other areas that were short staffed, take on special projects and be able to jump on the front end as needed. For the most part, everyone was well overworked for the compensation. I learned a variety of skills while working at Walmart, I do feel as though I became a valued employee to this company in doing so."
good,Have been at Walmart for 7 years with good benefits and great people to work with. The best part of working at Walmart are the coworkers. I was able to meet very ice people.
good,"I started working there before the store was even open I helped set up that store by placing together Dept's setting up dept endcaps,shelves,merchandise set ups,then fully stocked the whole store, participated in everything to get the store open, then began my time as a cashier then later on csm,and all the other times n all different Dept's."
good,Walmart is a okay place to work. It can get stressful at time because some customer can come in having a bad day so they try to gave you a hard time but all you have to do is keep a smile and stay positive. I learn how to move in a fast pace and keep an positive attitude. Management is okay here at Walmart. The most enjoyable part about part about the job is the fact that I can pick my hours.
good,"Work there was fun and easy management kept everything in order, work positions were evenly given and rules and regulations were always followed. there was always an opportunity to advance"
good,"nice place to work, learned to work with various tools and learned different products, management was great and had a lot of laughs.  the most challenging aspect of the job was meeting and exceeding the customers needs."
good,"I found that my overall experience with Walmart was that I had no issues with the job itself. I worked only when I requested, I felt like I was listened to by management, and my coworkers were pleasant people. The challenges came from the unique customer service atmosphere of Walmart. Some Walmart policies led to a lot of angry customers which could be hard to deal with at times."
good,"Wal-Mart was enjoyable at first, but once you pass your 90-day course they load everything on you. A lot of the managers were so stressed out I feel like they needed to step down and let someone who could handle it step up. They have an open door policy for every associate if you're having an issue but they don't really use it. A typical work day would include doing inventory, and stocking the shelves. Ask questions everyday about the new products or promotions to help the customer in the best way. I would also set up phone plans for customers, or go retrieve any item in the back that we did not have on the floor."
good,Started off as a cashier was able to work other departments also but when the lines get long at the registers they will pull you from your work load and help out up front.
good,La gerencia es tolerable tiende siempre a escucharte tus necesidades y preocupaciones y toma mucho.en cuenta tu opinion
good,"fiquei pouco tempo como jovem aprendiz mas aprendi muito com essa empresa, como foi meu primeiro emprego sai de lá com muito aprendizado."
good,Was good place to work. Ppl were helpful and home work balance was awesome. Would love to work there again I actually liked going to work and would recommend friends and family to work there.
good,"Es una empresa con cultura se servicio al cliente debido a su giro."
good,Able to support a family on the pay. Benefits are ok. Get a good deal of time off. Biggest reason I left was that the hours are not conducive to a healthy lifestyle.
good,"Wal-Mart as a whole is a great company to work for. Great pay, great benefits, great job experience! The only downfall to this company is that you must be in a store with a good management team to efficiently complete your job. If you have a bad store management team, you will quickly lose hope of doing your job correctly, or advancing for the right reasons. The hardest part of the job is just that - finding a good team to surround yourself with in terms of upper management. The best part of the job is the associates on your level. Wal-Mart builds a great workplace environment for building great work relationships with your peers."
good,Walmart is a good place to work but you will definitely work for your pay check. The people whom you work with at this destination are in their own little groups but all co workers treat each other with respect. The manager Robbie is one of my main complaints because he walks around and really doesn't do anything and treats co workers disrespectfully. Rochelle and Andy are absolutely 100% amazing managers and have the patience and respect to train employees and direct them in the right direction. The hardest part of being a stocker is time management and its physically demanding.
good,empresa que presa pela sua cultua e respeita a diversidade.
good,"usuallly hot in the automotive department, changed oil to the vehicles, and/or changed the tires and/ or the batteries mainly. I learned how to drain the oil properly and to change the tires to the vehicle and how to balance the tires. Management would get on us when there were many customers, to get the vehicles done as fast as possible, but they were a good management. There was anything to hard for me, I would just get to work every day. The most enjoyable part was when my co-workers and I got vehicles completed efficiently while being able to talk, because if we are just talking then that is not good for us or the company."
good,"Pros: "
good,Okay place to work part time. I enjoy working with people and consider it a challenge to provide excellent customer service to the clients. Management is inconsistent with policies.
good,Teaches you to be humble and to maintain self-control. Shows you that your job matters. Shapes and mold you into a better person. Gain a lot of experience and knowledge.
good,"Wal-Mart starts with the unpredictability of jobs you have to do regardless whether it is a slow day or a busy day of customers and/or products.  The management is well organized, but every once in a while it does get into a bit of a slippery slope.  The atmosphere is somewhat decent whether it is the organization of the store the people that work there.  The hardest part to me is to try to make every customer feel needed considering the fact not everyone that comes is always going to be pleased.  It is something that myself and the other employees have to adjust and to just roll with it.  The only thing I enjoyed about the job was that some of the employees are nice enough people to have a conversation with, and sometime there are nice enough customers to speak to knowing that met an employee that is there for them."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was not bad. People were friendly hours weren't bad pay was ok. Benefits should be offered straight away and not have to wait, it should also be offered to parttimers"
good,"arriving at work depending on your shift, meeting with department manager who will provide you with daily assignment."
good,Company gives you an opportunity to switch from position to postion. Pays well for a part time job. Overall a pretty good company to work for and would recommend it to anybody
good,"Everyday I help check out customers, Operating the cash register and handling cash transactions with customers"
good,"When I first got there we unload the truck, then stock the freight off the truck,and last but not least we cleaned up everything! Sweeping, moping, picking up wood pallets."
good,"was a wonderfull place to work, lots of friendly places and helpfull managment. They helped with what ever i needed help with, and havea  good training/managment team"
good,Walmart is a really good place to start any career as a young guy. quick-paced environment. Dealing directly with customers  and help to please their needs.
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo pero él salario era muy bajo
good,"Walmart is a fun environment to work.  I enjoyed the staff and the the Walmart pay.  Plus the benefits after working your 30 Days that you was able to receive. The benefits always came in handy.  Even if it was a just 30% off of sale.  30% adds up.  So saving that amount is very helpful.  On top of satisfaction guaranteed. You can always exchange even if you do not have the receipt.  You will just receive the exchange with a Walmart card rather than cash.  Which suits me fine,"
good,Walmart is an ok place to work it all depends on how well you get along with the management team in your store.This determines how many opitions for advancement you will get.
good,The two best things about the Walmart Corporation were its work place diversity and its culture.  You were always made feel part of a team and there was a lot of communication between management and staff.
good,Looking for season job it's a great job work for sometimes 5 days a week 12 hours a day provide lockers and area to rest and very friendly environment to work in
good,Working at Walmart is interesting. My boss is a sweet lady and tries to be in charge but everyone runs over her. She tries and gets to close with her employees which is very unethical and always caters to certain people. There is defiantly favoritism in the office and it is very obvious. i enjoy working with people and I like t build some kind of trust between patients and myself to ensure to them they are getting their moneys worth.
good,They don't care about the employees at all. I work as a cart Pusher and got yelled at for coming in and get water to drink in 100* weather. I put a day off and got yelled at.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work with the right people in line."
good,family orientated work enviroment.  if you like to meet new people wal-mart is the place for you.  employees change almost on daily or weekly so you always working with new people
good,Working at Walmart was a learning experience.  Everyday there was something new going on in the store or in the company.  The customers make the job interesting.
good,Overall decent place to work. Management team could be better but I believe it’s problem only st the store that work out. The benefits are good well and you can buy stock.
good,"Great supervisor, overall management no so. Even though they hire many disabled and mentally challenged workers, they could not forgive my mistake and let me stay with my job which I worked very hard at.  I took up the slack from other workers who were too lazy to do their job.  I saw many come and go in my department because they didn't really want to work and lift boxes."
good,"If you do your work well don't give them any excuse to fire you. They don't work well with health conditions even if you have them on file. Be prepared to help push carts as they are always short staffed there and by golly wear good athletic shoes because anything else will get torn up. Be wary of backstabbers as upper management will not investigate your side till they terminate you. Always pay for your items and be a good worker. Have lots of patience and i hope you can tell age well or have a good gut feeling so you don't underage sale. Many kids try to and even adults try to buy on expired or no license. Just follow the law and talk to hr on problems. Even when on break or off the clock or even on days off when people know you work there they want your help and so offer to go get someone else as it is your break time or you are off, or if your day off you are not required to."
good,"People are great to deal with."
good,"I have syncope and there were times where i could not come into work because i will be really sick and i had doctor statements but the manager did not want to work with me on that, but other than that the job was good i loved walmart."
good,"Walmart is a place to work if you appreciate teamwork. You have to be able to work on your own to finish a common goal. You work 9 hour shifts with two 15 minute on the clock, and a 1 hour break off the clock."
good,"Walmart was the perfect job for a college student, as they worked easily with your college schedule as a cashier. The pay was very competitive for a cashier position. The job was beyond easy, but stressful when large orders came. It's hard on your feet and back because you must stand the entire time you are working which can be anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. Lunch breaks are very generous at an hour long, and so are the fifteen minute breaks which are about every two hours. Don't look forward to getting full-time here, though."
good,"Walmart has been a large company and a large employer.  It has been good to large and small cities alike, and good to many families.  Behind it, there is an anthropological sentiment which is based on the costumers.  Long live Walmart, so far as the managerial staff can accommodate all of its employees in hard times and easy."
good,"Typical work day would be start off by turning all the TV'S on in the morning and making sure that the cash registers work. If there was anything that needed to be overstocked, we would either put it in the back and bin it in the right located bins, or we would label them for inventory if that was not already done so. Simply help customers with questions, unlock doors for video games, headphones, cases, etc. Treat each customer with respect, as the customer is always first!"
good,"Very busy and often stressful but we all work together as a team to get the job done, which is taking care of our customers in a friendly, timely manner."
good,Super easy job! Great workmates too and you're never really bored. You'll meet lots of interesting folks. Management needs work though. Hardest part would have to be remembering the chemical waste steps. It can be time consuming too. but overall not a bad job.
good,"I like my job, but I had a hard adaptation in the first 2 months. I was difficult for me to have right informations and to get any solicitation. When I learned, all was too easy for me. Plus, my communication with the co-workers only improved when I completed 2 months working in Walmart."
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart and with my coworkers that I had over there. They treat you well, you get all the mandatory breaks and they give bonuses at the end of each month. You have to work on the holidays but it's worth it in the end. The holiday bonus is bigger. Honestly, if I could go back, I would be there everyday on time and loving it. The work is hard but I love the benefits."
good,"Always job advancement available, decent pay fast paced lots to do. Can easily make a career out of working there. Routines are in place and make for a productive work day"
good,"Great co workers"
good,"Durante mi estancia aprendí mucha cosas,  como manejo de cajas y vales de despensa, arqueos, entrega de valores, apertura y cierre de póliza, conciliaciones bancarias, fines administrativos. organización personalizada de los superiores, como en todo trabajo cada día hay nuevos retos."
good,"buena empresa, se aprende todos los días, lo mas difícil son los horarios y lo que mas me agrado fue que cuidan mucho de sus empleados."
good,"More so the company is very good, just the lack of hours that wrre given around the time of the season is what lead me to leaving and exploring my ootions."
good,how to fix automotive troubleshot problems and to make a customer satisfied so they can come back for a future business great co workers every department
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart.  Many friends were created there.  The management sometimes has too many projects for one day if they want them to be done right.  Must keep focused and do your job.
good,"I exceed expectations in the role of retail. I adapt to change easily, work well under pressure with a positive attitude and is detailed-oriented. i go beyond the call of duty by seeking out and following responsibilities, and contribute frequently to dept meetings. I am an active listener,manages my time efficiently,demonstrates professionalism and is always conscientiouse about the qualityof my work. Although i work well independently, i would benefit from additional team-building skills."
good,"My job as an over night stocker was great. I worked at a store that was closed at night so we didn't have the public in there. Was just us, a team of maybe 12-15. Everyone did their part then helped others. I highly enjoy working there and would do it again if offered"
good,i should have stayed its a decent job with great pay. the people i worked with were friendly and there was crazy customer every one and awhile not like everyone thinks
good,The hardest part of the job it to continually greet every customer that comes within 10 feet of you. The management keep on you to stay busy and engaged so that it looks like you are always working to keep a professional environment.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working here.  I loved learning about different medications.  I also enjoyed having paid vacations and insurance.  I got along greet with aall the people i worked with.  They also made sure we also took our breaks.
good,"Competitive and fast paced. Disciplined and used technology to their advantage. "
good,A typical day at work is very laid back. Just stocking shelves and working with the rest of your co-workers. I learned that team work is the best way to get things done. management was very professional. Very relaxed workplace.
good,"very busy, pay is good. get benefits, even if part time. get pto hours.get breaks,  need breaks, busy atmosphere. some management good, some, not so good."
good,"Paid well for time. Expectations were very clear. week and hours were flexible as long as work was done within deadlines. Served a variety of companies with a varity of jobs including evaluating displays , measuring and evaluating service with clear expectations."
good,"good job great pay way to get your foot in the door great opportunity for advancement always good to try to make your production, Most managers are understanding."
good,"clock in, report assigned location, start restocking merchandise so customers can get what they need. Assist customers with merchandise questions, directing them to the proper aisles or departments so they get what they need. Insure all floors are clear, maintain safe working environment. Unload new merchandise trucks, separate and stock."
good,Walmart is a great place to learn new skills. I enjoyed customers service. I learned a lot about retail. Walmart is very flexible around everyone's schedule.
good,I love Walmart but its management is lacking big time.  Great opportunities for advancement if you stand out but getting to salary is next to impossible.
good,"I think it’s a great place to work if you can handle working long, standing hours under pressure. The pay is really good and they give you a lot of hours."
good,"Employees should be trained more based on their job duties. Employees are left alone without being certified to perform the job, it is very uncomfortable when you are not fully trained."
good,"Walmart was a temporary job. I worked for a temp agency, so it was always serious and also business.but i gotta say it was an experience to meet and greet new faces."
good,"A day at work consisted of getting your feet on the ground as soon as you could. Check email. Respond to any ""fires"" and go from there. Use the structure provided for maximum efficiency and everything will be fine."
good,Safety is a big part of walmart. You can across train many positions and management can be unreliable but the workplace culture is good. Hard part of the job is production but have great employees.
good,"Working with the public can be a challenge but some people are very kind and love getting to know them.work days are the same but different every day ,running the register, helping them to find product, finding what is best for them,checking in inventory and outs,helping fill scripts when needed and and answer phones,just a few things to do each day.  At the moment on leave because of family and moved out of state  had no problem with working with on the leave."
good,I like to communicate and with working in dairy and frozen i didnt get to do much communicating with customers or other employees. But other then that the job was enjoyable.
good,Good place to work good benefits 40hrs a week 3rd shift managers are not that great but the work isn't bad. I was maintenance waxd all the floors by myself plus scrubbing and buffing and general maintenance
good,I was very happy to work for this company. Management is very helpful and willing to help you when necessary. The downside of working here is that its takes away a lot of your social and family life. In order to advance you to have to be fully dedicated to working and it takes a lot of time from your children. Great company overall!!!
good,Exigencia por igual mejoras en el ambiente laboral
good,Muy buen amniente laboral lo que me gustava mucho era eltranporte de personal
good,I liked working for this company just wish they would have been considerate of my pregnancy. Its was either my job or unborn.the decision had to be made after refusal to train me for different position with lighter work
good,"i have learned aloyt at Walmart,the company helped me build my experience and opened my mind about alot of stuff such as diversty of culture, interaction with peoples ..."
good,"Loved the fast pace on days we had trucks.Loved to have seen more of a cooperative team effort,from management and other associates.Loved to help costumers find things they was looking for and just glad to help."
good,Wal-Mart is more about making $ than anything else. They expect you to work with out help. Too many call off leaving you to do others jobs.  Some members of management overwork you.
good,Must be able to work fast and adapt to a forever changing environment. Teaching and training was a big part of my job description.  Must have flexible scheduling.
good,Working for Walmart was not horrible but was not the best either. The hours were ok and a little flexible but not by much. I just really like the jobs I had while at Walmart and my managers.
good,"I did like my job, it was very hands on, got to meet all kinds of people, sometimes challenging but mostly satisfying."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart because I love to shop at Walmart.   Helping the customers made my job as a retail associate more interesting and meaningful.
good,It was an alright job while I finished high school and college. management was always willing to help any of the staff in need. coworkers were friendly but unmotivated in their lives.
good,The hours were great and there was no weekends. They gave you time to do your work as well as use your time management. they didnt care about ouside life
good,"Poor management in certain departments. Not enough employees. Too much overtime. Do not work with you on your schedule. Promises part-time, does not deliver."
good,"There is a routine that takes getting used to but after time, the job is quite easy.Furthermore, the management is nice and are always willing to accommodate my needs when it comes to school."
good,It was s very fast paste job working over night even though the store would be closed we had yo get things done in a certain amount of time I liked working the night shift I also think they pay their employees good and give chances to grow in the company
good,"Walmart is great environment too work and learn quite a bit I enjoyed working at Walmart all the way until my last days there, The work is always there their is always something to do working overnight one of the biggest things you can do is learn to work all departments in the store that way your knowledgeable of all department for several different reason first off for knowledge of the company also if a customer asks you something you want to have some idea of what they are talking about for the best customer service. There will be good and bad days sometimes call off or don't show but thee work has to be done I liked the idea that some of the managers would come work with us if we need help or just to learn their team better and then you have some that won't knowing that something couldn't be finished which is terrible for the crew as a whole...But the experience is priceless their are always a few bad apples but I never let that ruin the bunch I do believe that upper management should step in when they know is a manager is wrong or bogus I also understand that they have protocol that they must follow but the employee shouldn't have too suffer which was the case with me I would still recommend someone too work there business is still good and their is plenty of opportunity there"
good,I was a cashier at Walmart and I can honestly say it was one of the best jobs I've ever had. Until I got hurt that is and messed up my shoulder for good. But they always help me when I needed it and understood me and how I worked and worked with me not against me. Always full of laughs and smiles and great people they really treat you like family.
good,"Walmart was a very good experience because the pay well for retail, They have rules in place so managers are not able to try and get over everything is equal opportunity. There is very little chance of advancement in the company even with a degree,"
good,"Checking out customers and handling all of their needs from simple to complex, working the customer service desk doing multiple money transactions, delegating tasks to others, doing money audits and sending reports.  Doing end of shift reports.  Sorting claims and doing item returns."
good,"Generally, not a bad place to work, however dealing with management that doesn't always support you, or will not assist you at all based on their own personal opinion of you is altogether discouraging of employment opportunities within the establishment. They offer incredible compensations, employee discounts with various providers and businesses, and a pretty legitimate stock ownership program. 401k, health insurance, life insurance and other necessities are also offered by the company. Management in the store I was previously employed at started out kind and genuine, and would go out of their way to help, however towards the end of my tenure became altogether belligerent, insulting and incapable of taking responsibility for any particular situation. They were willing to bend the rules in whatever way they wanted to, and if they were intent upon terminating an individual's employment, would often utilize underhanded methods in order to achieve said goal. All in all, despite the fact that the management does have a tendency to be inconsistent and altogether unfair in their actions and decisions, the company itself provides a host of benefits for employees, especially long term employees who work hard and seek to advance within the corporation."
good,Very fast paced. Tasks assigned are not completable due to other circumstances Not enough staff. Poor communication amongst management. Mist be able multitask. Follow directives and work hard.
good,"É uma excelente empresa, tem oportunidade de crescimento e o tempo que trabalhei lá foi muito contrutivo para o meu conhecimento."
good,"Bom de se trabalhar pra conhecer o sistema WMS, o problema são metas absurdas de se alcançar."
good,Great for a starter job or a second job due to the fact there isn't many Full-Time positions. Lack of communication between so many levels of managment.
good,"start working, no break till 3 hrs after working. then its only 20 mins."
good,"Typically a night at work kept me busy, but I never felt rushed to get things done. As long as you stay on task, don't show up late to work or from your breaks then management was easy to work/deal with. Workplace culture was busy yet easy going. Sometimes you had to deal with some difficult customers but nothing outrageous. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts of stock from the back to the designated areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was having good people to be around, the sense of accomplishment when the tasks were finished and the fact that I felt welcome and appreciated."
good,"This was a good entry level position to start your management career. After you learn the basics to management you can either work your way up in the company or like I seek a higher paying position."
good,Buena empresa con posibilidades de mejorar laboral
good,It was a up and down type of job some days it was work some days it wasn't. It could have been put together better and the work could have been more productive. Some girls could have been better.
good,"The jobs were really easy to do, sometimes a little dangerous though.  The hardest part of the job was being outside in very hot weather or rain.  The other employees were very nice and easy to get a long with."
good,Empresa oferece varias oporrunidades de crescimento.
good,Held so many different positions in the company but my favorite was a department manager.  Can't tell you a typical day because ever area of the store is different.  The only thing that is the same is that we take care of our customers.  Each store is different.  You can join a great store or a really bad store.  It all depends on which type of management team that is there.  Hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by customers and insulted by them.
good,Your pace of work depends entirely on your position. As a cashier you will be scanning and bagging things as quickly as possible to get through your line and keep he customers happy. Though as a stocker it depends on the weight and quantity of the items of your area and what is expected after you have finished the current assignment.
good,One of the managers there talks to people rude and when I worked the when I heard her voice my stumick would turn inside out. But other then that I loved working there. I was just the one person that would me it bad to work there. She thinks she can talk to people how ever she wants but I think she should go back to a regular association.
good,come in clock in and start unloading the truck and stacking it up to take on the floor and to put on the shelves and brake down the boxes and put them in the back
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, it filled with fast paced activity and you learn many skills and have the opportunity to advance. some managers are cut throat and unappreciated of their associates, there is no compassion. they have many shifts to accommodate everyone."
good,I really enjoyed working in the accounting office. I would have stayed longer if I didn't have to do a coop placement. Very fast paced and I enjoyed keeping busy for the whole shift.
good,"Face paced job, a comfortable work environment co workers where nice.Being able to help a customer was   and check them out at a fashionable time. Showing them deals and role backs."
good,Occupation recquired consistent attention to detail and face to face customer contact. High expectations on improving the Customer Experience. Fast paced job expectations.
good,"The biggest take away from working at Walmart is learning how to deal with difficult customers and how to manage your time wisely. Aside from dealing with customers, the other part of my job is to handle all cashier's breaks and everything else they needed. Along with that, you are also responsible to balancing all the cash registers in the store and making sure that the money goes where they are suppose to"
good,I learned about photo equipment and how to maintain industrial size printing. The position taught me how to interact with customers for an extended period of time.
good,Walmart allows an equal opportunity for those who are looking for employment. Management is willing to work with your schedule and train you in order for you to advance.
good,"Fast pace retail environment right outside Portland, ME. Lots of good people and a very seasonal store near beaches, the Maine Mall, and the 295 highway. I made many good friends and memories there."
good,Working at walmart was a interesting and fun experience. It had it up and downs but overall i was generally happy with the time i was there. The workers was friendly and easy to work with and the managers was cool for most part. As far as workload it got heavy at times but we pulled together and worked as a team and thats very important in any business so overall working at walmant was pleasant experience.
good,"good place to work except they don't work with your school schedule, rather than work around your schedule, they'll just cut your hours without even trying to schedule shifts around your classes"
good,"Depending if you were morning or evening you either would be stocking or zoning. Learned how to prioritize tasks and help others. Management was overall good, many managers cared and would help out on the floor. Hardest part would have to be getting the store 100% zoned every night. Most enjoyable part would have to be my co-workers, who were like friends and family."
good,I have been with Walmart going on 11 years in all honesty I must say the experience one would have with Walmart depends on Management-good or bad and the decisions of the corporate market team.
good,"Too much work, not enough people. did the best we could. long hours, a lot asked of you. praise is seldom, rebuke often. "
good,Most of the management was very unprofessional at the location I worked at. Co workers were very nice though. I received the SAM award after two months of working there which felt really nice to be recognized for my work.
good,"It was a good first job, I learned alot being there that I can bring to others jobs. I was never doing just one job all the time so I learned to do more than one job outside my normal."
good,Buena empresa para trabajar si ya no tienes mas opciones.
good,"8am-4pm you start frying chicken and displaying them in the case and checking every two hours, Managment don't communicate well, but over all was a decent job"
good,Honestly its a good place to start when you are young of age but not so when you have children and are older than 25. In short the company is good for youth
good,I would come in to work and clock in. After that i would open my cash register station and start helping customers scan and bag their groceries. I would take over for other cashier's too if they were going on break.
good,"get to help customers with there concerns, resolve issues. help employees with all there needs, work in the a very fast pace, great training in customer service skills."
good,Working at Walmart is sometimes quite a challenge. Always short employees which makes it hard to get the jobs done in a neat & timely fashion. I enjoy our customers the most! Most of the management is alright& very helpful but there are others that will take forever to come if we need them.
good,"checking people out, taking care of returns and money transfer in and out of the country "
good,Faced paced work environment. Scanning  purchases and accepting payments while being friendly and helpful to customers and other team members. Many departments to choose from.
good,Wal-mart is a nice place to work at when you want work experience. They start you off at $9/ hour part time and when you are done with training you have can go up to $10/ hour.
good,This a great place to learn and see every part of getting items to our customers! This includes scheduling inbound pick ups from vendors to the outbound deliveries from our DC's to stores.
good,"Currently, I love working with Wal-Mart because they allow me to change my career path whether that be something with Loss Prevention or in management. The benefits aren't fabulous but they are better than other places I've worked for. Management can be hostile from time to time but it depends on the person"
good,"The day begins at 8am to be greeted with a monitory attendance meeting every morning, spending the first 15 minutes standing around and wasting time before they allowed us to get to work. We would have to empty individual shelves and dismantle them before moving the shelves for the floor remodel, then reassemble those shelves and  restock them before going to finish tearing apart the floor tiles."
good,"A typical day is coming and setting up my work area making sure everything is prepared and ready for the day, What I learned is how to master all the skills in a productive way every department I work in I mastered, Management was about change nothing was the same everyday, Work place culture was bright, the hardest part was putting your all in your work, most enjoyable part was knowing that you finished the job well."
good,I loved the folks that I worked with on a daily basis. It was very rewarding to help the customers in their needs. This job is a self starting job from the time you clocked in. Access what needed to be done and start on it.
good,A very good company to work for if you don't have any other daily things to do. Gives you a chance to meet new people and you might get the chance to make someones day.
good,Provides insurance and has benefits. Also offers scholarships if you want to go to school. Has many different departments that you can choose from. You can meet so many different people there.
good,This Walmart had nice employees and friendly customers. $9.00 an hour rely helped me out. The employees were always willing to help me out if I needed anything.
good,I actually enjoyed this job. I was an unloader in the warehouse removing merchandise from the trucks as they came in. The supervisor was great and as well as the management at the time i was there.
good,When I worked at Walmart they were friendly and helpful. I was a college student trying to start out and they were flexible with my hours. They worked as a team. But policy change over time and so do people. I found myself feeling stuck so when I was asked to move out of state to assist some family and they transferred me to the wrong area I took it as a sign to part ways.
good,On the usual day at my Walmart it would be pretty busy from morning to night. But i enjoyed my job from the socializing with new people everyday and on top of that making friends and connections with the everyday walmart customers.
good,I never really get the chance to be bored working at Walmart.  We are constantly busy.  The only problem I have there is it feels like Im back in high school.  Drama
good,"Es una empresa buena, estable y reconocida. El salario que pagaban era muy bajo"
good,"I enjoyed working with and talking to the customers. They made my job worth wild. The only bad thing about that job, was working with the irate customers."
good,Walmart is a good  place to work. I have been there for over 8 years. I do think they could do better with compensation. I feel like my opportunity for moving up is limited. They could also provide better training programs. They work you hard and sometimes with litttle help.  You have to be dedicated to stay there. They change some of our benefits. We get pto time and this is used for everthing. You accumulate pto every pay period. But its not good if you get sick. We dont have sick pay only pto. When use all that your on your own. And that worries me.
good,"Relaxed at most times and was a fast pace job at most times. You can't slack or be on phone at all. Which I like that, a lot of people usually would rather get on their phones and have someone else to most of the work."
good,"it is a great place to work at, very relaxing and chill. the pay is not that good, but it is resourceful. you will have a good oppurtunity at moving up in rank when it come to this jiob."
good,"After working with this company for more than 4 years, it was still hard to obtain a full time job. My job status was ""part time"" but often times I was told no full time positions were available in a 24 hour/ 7 day a week establishment. Walmart is a good place to work if you are looking for a 2nd job or part time work. You must enjoy working with the public and have plenty of patience."
good,"Loved my job at Wal-Mart except  for one thing: horrible store manager. I thought I would be with the company for years, and enjoyed my job. Then I was let go out of nowhere, and for very questionable reasons. I was devastated. It's true what they say: one bad manager can ruin an entire staff. And that's exactly what's happening here."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, however, I know lots didn't. It depends on each person. My position involved dealing with all the angry/frustrated customers and workers and resolving things. That was very tough sometimes and not my favorite task, it came easily to me though, so I did enjoy the job overall."
good,"I had to work evening hours at this position but otherwise, I gained some skills such as balancing cash funds, maintaining and reconciling all charge transactions."
good,If you are new to this retail giant and have any questions for managment be prepared to run all over the store back and forth trying to find someone who will answer the question. They will constantly tell you to ask someone else untill you are back to the first person you asked.
good,"It's a tough place to get started, you get part-time hours and not a lot of them. But if you work hard and are good at your job there are lots of places to advance. Yearly performance reviews and bonuses allow you to make more money every year. Full time is a little hard to get but again, if you're a good employee they're never short on hours and will likely be considered when a position opens up. My first year I was a bad employee, late, didnt care for the job, etc. They sat me down and told me to shape up or ship out. So I worked hard and 1 year later I was promoted full time."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company and would probably still be with them except for the fact that I transferred from Pearland, Texas to Wichita Falls, Texas to replace an Assistant Manager who was going to retire.  After selling my house and moving to Wichita Falls, the employee decided not to retire and there were no other Assistant Manager positions available.  I was offered a lower position until a position might become available and I accepted with a cut in pay.  After 6 months of waiting I decided to open my own business."
good,Good hours and shift. I learned computer skills and management skills.  High management turnover. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the trailers on the yard. Most enjoyable was the people. And I love receiving and very knowledge about the procedures and processes.
good,"Aprendi a tratar con los clientes a saber como solucionar sus problemas o disgustos "
good,"Una gran escuela para proyectarte y aprender todo lo relacionado a Logistica y Distribución, aprendes las bases de todo lo relacionado a un CEDIS"
good,"I started working at Walmart right when I started college and it was a great place to work in that it really worked with my school schedule. I was able to balance work and school extremely easily and they helped me in that regard whenever they could. I have been there for awhile and like all jobs you have your good days and bad. Personally though i have enjoyed my time there. Great environment, friendly coworkers, and a huge ability to move up!"
good,At Wal-Mart everybody works as a team. If a certain department needs help we all pitch together and get a job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a lot of different personalities. Sometimes customers come in angry and you need a lot of patience.
good,"It's a job, I don't have any more to say about it. I go to work do my job and go home. I would prefer not to do a review but your forcing me to do one"
good,I been there for about 3 years and I had a fun experience with my co workers and the customers it's a fun fast pace environment I learned a lot from being there and I would recommend others to try it out
good,Un dia tipico es trabajar duro todo los dias. Es siempre importante ver que hagas tu trabajo bien y a veces que no da tiempo de terminar eso seria lo mas dificil. El trao con los managers siempre ha sido excelente y eso creo es lo mas que me gusto
good,"I enjoyed working overnights, but there are too many managers telling you what to do, and it can get confusing on how you are supposed to do your job."
good,"Wal-Mart is a huge company, and management will definitely let you know that you are replaceable. Compensation wasn't horrible, but there are limits on benefits and if you're even one hour shy of full time your benefits decrease."
good,"Most days it is great working at Walmart.  You really have to have thick skin when dealing with customers.  It is a fast-paced and stressful job.  Company does not allow over-time and if you go over hours you have to cut time on your lunch.  You are allowed 9 absences, then you may be fired.  Absences you acquire will drop six months from the date you get them."
good,"Walmart is a huge company, i started at 18 while i went to school they work with your hours and have cool staff. since i left Walmart has really stepped it up"
good,This is a good company but it has its downs. Company doesn't seem to hold the same morals as before when the founder of the company was alive because of upper management but overall it is an ok company.
good,good money for relatively easy work.  it can get hectic during holidays as is at any retail job. my experience with people i work with are good. they helped me out alot during my first illness emergency they gave me leave for my moms stroke. she had an accident recently which lead to me putting in my two weeks notice. i mad arrangements and tried to retract my resignation but they still let me go.
good,Very fast paced and motivated. Learning new policies everyday. Managers didn't really communicate with each other. Workplace was friendly. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and down stacking. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking and meeting new customers everyday.
good,"Exercia muitas atividades na qual me deu enorme satisfação pessoal. Uma empresa desafiadora."
good,"Great place to work"
good,Compañia basada en compañerismo no permiten mucho desarollo es a largo plazo
good,"As a cake decorator, I fulfilled many duties, all of which I was given sufficient training to do.  Management was open to suggestions and worked to foster a good relationship between employees.  I learned to harness my creativity in an efficient way while still meeting the needs of customers.  The hardest part of the job was to meet the expectations of customers, but it was also the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed working overnights at Wal-Mart. I think that they do not pay their employees enough, though. Over all I liked the management and my co-workers."
good,It was a good place to work other then not getting very many hours. Never took my breaks on time. And if you didn't then your break was cut short. Did not pay very well to be able to support a family.
good,Nice place to work .had a lot of benefits.got payed vac.have everything I need but it's hard to move up.But over all I liked work there.very nice people to work with.
good,"It all depends on what department you are in, but there is always drama in every department you work in. A typical day at work is filled with some kind of annoyance, depending on what extra stuff they are having you do for that day. But you get used to it and you do your job for the day and do it to the best of your abilities. I learned how to handle difficult customer interactions everyday and how to grow upon that. There are problems with every manager, but the management team has some, but not many, good managers. The managers that are good are some of the best managers I've seen. They listen and care about your concerns. The hardest part of the job is how stretched thin my department is and how many extra things management has us do every singe day and still expect us to get our job done. The most enjoyable part of my job is honestly, smiling how excited customers get when I interact with them and not be just a machine that tells them ""Yeah it's over there"". They are talking with an actual person and they appreciate that."
good,could have a better balance between home and work life but that is determined on the position held the benefits are good and the environment is friendly
good,"While working for Walmart in the Benefits Department, I was able to use my skills effectively. However, job security is not good. I went on a deployment and when I came back I did not have a job."
good,"great place to work for they do alot for thier employers and community mangement is good to you as long as you show up for your shift and do your job, negative is not having good health insurance if any at all"
good,The workplace culture is awesome. They company is very active in diversity and inclusion for all walks of life. The majority of people are encouraging and uplifting when associates are going through a difficult place in their lives.
good,"It's hard work and you're on your feet all day, but the customers are generally great to deal with and management treats the employees fairly. Great place to work, but doesn't pay well."
good,"Productive, fun, prefect hygiene with and a save work environment. Also have a flexible work schedule. Management is grat and a typical day at work will be me just unloading the truck or working on the floor."
good,"Not the best job, but definitely not the worst. If all you want is a pay check then go right a head. Also good for college or high school kids in need of cash."
good,Walmart has been my career for17 years. Ive been everywhere in the company. Theres been time where going to work is not very fun. but most days I really lookforward to going to work. Ive learned a lot about my self and what  it takes to be a good manager.
good,"It was fast paced, I used to go in there and the day would just go by. As an online grocery pickup everything had deadlines. As a cashier time went slow. We had to make sure the customers were moving because we did not want big lines. When there were not a lot of people in the store we had to make sure our space was clean and the aisle was neat. The managers would tell us when to go to break and monitor how long we took. We had hour long lunches but worked for eight hours. The worst part of the day would have to be mean and rude customers. I tried my best to stay positive. But, at times it is hard to stay positive when their are people who try to ruin your day."
good,A typical day as a lower level manager is very stressful and fast paced but it is rewarding because of the level of ownership over your area of the business. The management is supportive and it is a family environment. The most difficult part of the the job is the customer service. It is difficult knowing that you can not make everyone happy.
good,Very friendly work environment motivated managers low theft rate while I worked there extremely busy especially during the holidays but I feel like the only thing they need to work on is their training
good,Good work life/balance. Management is always trying to be accommodating to needs of your family or personal issues.  The higher up you go the more stressful but rewarding the job can be.
good,"Working as an overnight cashier, The hardest part of the job was poor management choices that led to lack of cahiers and therefore putting all the work on either a single or few people. I really enjoyed my job, but it always felt like no matter how hard you worked (Even if you were running the whole front end by yourself) nothing was ever good enough."
good,I truly had a good experience with my years of working for Walmart my head good management and I worked with awesome people but that was years ago I here recently this Walmart has undergone some changes and it is not a good place to work anymore
good,I loved all my jobs its just the management team had their favorites. When customers walked up to me I made sure they got what they were looking for and if I couldn't find it I made sure to find someone to help them
good,You are told to do a task and then before you can finish you are told to do another task. You never have the feeling of a completed job. You must explain why you are not completing tasks after you are told to abandon them.
good,"I would go in and make sure that the store was ready for customers by stocking, straightening and double checking supplies in receiving. Help out on the register when help was needed."
good,"Each day brought forth new people and new life experiences, which kept life interesting and educational. There is always a variety of work  ranging from assisting customers, stocking shelves,and assisting at the registers.The most difficult part of the job was having to stand for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily experiences with the customers."
good,Managers walk around. Hide in office while the employees do all the work. But when the big boss come in town thry running around lost trying to do what should have been done.
good,it was a job to pay the bills. the hours were flexible. no week was the same schedule. never had weekends off. pay was okay. $10 hour. wich isnt much these days to keep head above water.
good,Great place to work. I did was part time so the hours were not to good. I would work like four to nine and that did take away time from my family and social life.
good,Not a bad place to work. Layed back job. Management was friendly and helpful sometimes. Pay was pretty good.. Very caring and friendly coworkers. Cool.
good,"It's a good enough place to work. Stable conditions. I'm not sure if I would go back and do it again, but it was easy enough and I did enjoy it and make friends while there."
good,"Walmart is alright as a job, but making a career out of it is something i don't see going well. Management was always changing due to their lack of skill or because they didn't fit well with their attitudes. If someone in management didn't like how you wont bend over backwards for them they would put you through some kind of punishment."
good,"Nesta empresa foi a minha primeira experiência e aprendi muitas coisas novas e a cultura deles são bem diferentes. O ambiente de trabalho em si era muito bom, onde todos se relacionavam muito bem e cada um fazia o seu trabalho."
good,Prestación de Servicios empresa Externa (Consultora Ambiental)
good,"not enough hours or overtime,poor management,not enough help, production is to high per hour.no overtime.not enough forklift drivers to help clear loads."
good,"Environnement de travail agréable et productif."
good,"A typical day for me consists of early morning start time. Breaking down the morning freight and stocking the sales floor. Keeping track of inventory. Customer service, etc. "
good,"Not a bad place to work-- some problems arise through poor management and associates who do not do what they are supposed to. Also, a lot of favoritism between managers and associates."
good,"I loved working for Walmart. The pay wasn't great, but i truly enjoyed working for this company and it's benefits were great! I loved all the people that I work with. I believe the management could have been better, but overall I loved what I done there!"
good,"Um local muito bom para trabalhar,r respeita as leis trabalhistas"
good,"sometimes erratic schedule changes occur, part time hours are typically 20 to 36. majority of the basic things learned are done on computer spanning around six months."
good,it was a nice workplace to work and I wouldn't mind going back and it was a decent workplace I loved certain employees and sometimes u could catch good discounts and first dibs on certain things it depends on what you where looking for at the time
good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy bueno y tranquilo, capacidad de aprender y enseñanza."
good,It was alright to work produce. The managers at the time was very rude and never listen to our problems. My coworkers was the only reason why i enjoyed working there.
good,I enjoy what I do but dealing with insebordination and lack of management backing is trying.  Lack of proper staffing and hour cuts also make my job hard to deal with.
good,"Overall its not a bad place to work. There is the occasional power tripped manager but those are everywhere. The pay for the work performed is not very good unless you have been there 10+ years. The worse part about Walmart, is if you have to work over or come in to cover for someone, and it makes you go over your scheduled hours they will make you take extended lunches to take the time back off...  so you give them your time, and in the end you do not get paid for it."
good,"The work environment was fun and easy, employees are like family and pay was good for overnights, managers actually listened and helped build a schedule that fit best for you"
good,"I had loved my job at Walmart at that time. I had a good rapport with all I worked with. I hated to leave, but I had moved to Indiana. The Walmart in Illinois was more friendly than the one I worked at in Indiana."
good,"starting up machines in the photolab, ordering product for the lab and electronics, going over the schedule and the budget for the department, cusomer service and quility control. "
good,Walmart is a great place to work. As long as you can handle grumpy customers from time to time and work fast to get your required jobs done. Usually if you need anything they will work with you. Good pay rate.
good,Recommend applying here despite any doubts arisen from peer influence. Great team work system in management and associates going up the ladder or across job duties. Seen a lot more good hearedrole at customer service desk  than scammers and that felt great.
good,Good place to work when there is enough associates to cover every piece of work that needs to be done. Sometimes has issues with keeping employees and is slow to hire replacements.
good,"A typical day at work is very quick and keeps you on your toes. You have to pay attention to every detail. I learned a lot about patient care and health along with what medications do what for every health problems. Management in the pharmacy is very good. My manager is a very good worker and she care dearly about her employees. The hardest part of my job is dealing with health insurance and prior authorizations. The most enjoyable thing is making customers happy and seeing that I did my best to make them smile. Also, being around good co workers that make my job so much easier."
good,Walmart was an okay place to work at. if you are lucky to get 40hrs the pay is worth it but I would recommend Walmart inc to the next person. Some bosses are good some are bad but great place to work.
good,Working as a cashier at Wal-Mart can lead to a nice consistent  paycheck when scheduled consistently. The pay was decent and has increased since then.
good,i was a AP HOST (door greeter) and the customers said I had great customer service skills but I went to college to work in the media field and being a Ap host was not what i wanted to do with my life but I had a great time.
good,"work the freight, help people, "
good,"I can't give specific work environment information. I did not work FOR Wal-mart...they were my customer. I enjoyed my time with this customer; however, I did not work for them."
good,Good job if you don't mind part time hours corporate office is in control of the schedule and management can work with the days and you don't get pro time till you hit you 6mo mark
good,"Very careless scheduling, poor hours, and insufficient pay. They hire too many people that are not motivated/inexperienced, which in return makes for a long stressful day for motivated/experienced workers."
good,"é um grande mercado, e comigo posso fazer ele crescer aina mais."
good,"I worked at the warehouse for a few years. Some management could need some work with favoritism and being, sometimes, unprofessional. Other wise I would recommend working there if you like working a fast pace."
good,"el ambiente es muy bueno  siempre  hay que estar  buscando nuevas formas de vender  así mismo el cambio de los productos   para que resalten y poderlos vender mas  ,  los compañeros   son agradables ,  hay posibilidades de crecimiento , pero   dejarías  mucho el lado social  ya que  el trabajo  te acapara mucho tiempo   adicional a tu  horario ,  aprendes  el manejo de equipos de computo, cajas y o montacargas"
good,All my jobs I've had in the past and now has taught me not to limit myself. I am ready for a different atmosphere and fields of career. Able to learn.
good,"is a great place to work, got along with all my co-workers  and management,the most joyable part of the job is getting to help the customers find what they need/ want and having them leave happy cause they found what they need/ wanted"
good,Workers should get better pay for the amount of work they do. There was a lot of things to learn with no formal training. Management was okay to deal with.
good,You have to have great customer service and also patience. The job is very easy but keeps you busy. The co-workers are very easy to get along with. You get a good amount of breaks.
good,Assistant Store Management was my first true role out of school. I took this position to learn the retail business and get my foot in the door. Humble beginnings.
good,"Great people to work with, always something to keep busy with throughout the day. Flexible work schedule and amazing superior's. Willing to work with me throughout my pregnancy and make sure that I felt comfortable at work through out the day."
good,Wonderful company that put a lot of effort into training their associates. Everyone who has a desire to advance can. The resources available to be successful at your job were readily available.
good,I learned how to take care of customers when there is a problem and also information about insurance. Learned how to put information in a computer for a patient.
good,"its a reat place to work, and learn a lot of new things. anyone can work there and advance in the company, if you choose to do so. Whether, your on day shift or night shift, everyone works together as a team, to get the job complete."
good,Overall Walmart is a great company to work for but if you have never worked in Retail it can be overwhelming.  Customer is always right even if they are spitting in your face and that is hard to get used to.
good,A typical day will consist of lots of walking. You learn what to look for in order to prevent/reduce theft/loss/shrink. Leads safety meetings for the store and gives tours to new hires. Additionally the Fort Wayne area provides additional outside resources and training with the Allen County Prosecutor and Fort Wayne Police Department. You may work as part of a team or by yourself depending on the needs of the store.
good,remove old shelves and replace new shelves and mechandisre back on shelf according to floor plan a Monday through Friday and worked forty hours a week
good,it depends on what store you're in and what manger you have over the store that will make a great environment you work in. your co-workers will make the day depends on the person.
good,Fast Paced environment. Productive. Typical work day approximated 12 hours. Constant environment of change  with daily challenges. Great use of my skill sets and temperament.
good,I think they could review management in some stores but most overall is was a good experience and job as a CAP2 inventory specialist/acting supervisor. Insurance benefits could be beefed up considering they are a top profitable organization but yet have the highest number of employee's on state assistance than any other company.
good,"Depending on the management at different walmart's the cons can"
good,"My days started early. I am a training coordinator. I teach the brand new associates both processes that our center provides for our stores. We are back office support, therefore we handle all invoices and receivings and match the ones that didn't auto-match together for whatever reason. They could have been checked in incorrectly or not checked in at all. We are an office of exceptions. I worked well with all of the management team and the environment. I taught training classes and thoroughly enjoyed doing what I do. I recently became a mother and I am looking for a career closer to home."
good,"I worked for Walmart for over two years. In that time I saw many different types of managers. There were managers that were understanding when something didnt go right, and would help you find a solution. There were also managers that prided themselves on their ability to micromanage and punish their employees for the smallest slight. The Culture created in the stores is one resembling a family, where ""work friends"" become people that you talk to outside of work and become true friends. Pay is average for retail, with starting pay depending on past work experience, and subsequent raises being given each year to reward both tenure, and performance. Advancement is quick and easy depending on your own personal drive. Benefits and time off are given after one full year of working, or once you begin working full time."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has many pros and cons, for example, at certain periods you work fast because it's busy so it makes the days go by fast, at other times it's slow and you look for things to do to stay busy."
good,"A typical day was fine. However,most of the management at my prior location tended to show favoritism and treat those in lower ranks with disrespect. Walmart overall was a great job opportunity."
good,"Extremely difficult to complete tasks and exceed expectations, when you are not guided or instructed on how to complete them.  However, the customers were the best part of the job. Being able to provide them with a positive experience was the most important aspect of the job to me.  Fellow associates were very helpful, but management was a little lacking in direction."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y pagan bien es agradable laborar
good,"its a fun place to work and get along with one anther"
good,Muy Buena empresa y equipo de trabajo el tiempo que trabaje me sentí como en familia
good,"My typical day is cooking, cleaning, organizing, helping customers in a timely manner, helping with any concerns.  My dept. is very fast paste when it comes to cooking and taking care of customers.  Very multi-task dept."
good,"I worked at Walmart for 14+ years. There were times when I did not really feel I had job security. As long as you are doing your best to get things done and focus on your tasks, they don't have much reason to bother you (Unless you're committing safety violations or stealing or something that otherwise doesn't line up with most places' code of ethics). "
good,"Days are long, working with a good group, makes the time go by quickly. Being able to multi task quickly and efficiently is necessary. Temperatures change, be prepared."
good,"It was good experience to gain , I learned a lot , I enjoyed working amongst all the employees , the managers were very respectful and help out a lot around schedules"
good,"Walmart is quick paced, with a lot of work. This is a good job to work at, short and long term. This job has 401k, benefits, and discounts. Do not work at a Walmart in Philadelphia."
good,Great work experience for anyone eager to learn the retail business from the number one company in the world. Also the company is very diverse willing to provide jobs to anyone who is ready to work.
good,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for 13 years and throughout all these years I really appreciated the work environment and my co-workers. It was easy-going, even on the days when there was a lot to do and having friendly coworkers, who basically considered me to be family, made it that much enjoyable."
good,Not really a bad place to work for someone who likes working. May seem like they push the wrong people to do more at the job but it is just their way of saying they are liking what you are doing and want you to succeed to move up the ladder
good,Working at Walmart brought me great pleasure. I really enjoyed working with electronics and communications as well as helping out with the photo shop.
good,Wonderful benefits and good pay. Advancement  opportunities within the company. Changes daily to meet the demand of the consumer and associates. Each store is like a family.
good,"A typical day in the Walmart Deli depended on what shift you were scheduled for. Employees performed duties from serving customers, cooking food, prepping rotisserie chickens, making the salads and sandwiches on display, stocking shelves, ordering truck orders, and just about everything else you could imagine. We did have a great management team. The camaraderie among the employees in the deli and bakery was one of a kind. The hardest part of the job was would have to be when the truck orders arrived and it was time to date, rotate, and stock the cooler and freezers. Everything else I would have to say was quite enjoyable."
good,"Well it was a day that my register came up short $98 but it wasn't my fault it actually was one of the CSM Fault and when I got wrote up for it I told her but she still made me sign it. And another day is when I was late for work but my mom called because we had car problems. And they told me it was fine to come on in , then a couple weeks later  I was terminated but not by my manager but by another manager. I learned to remain a positive attitude even when customers didnt have  a good day. I learn to not follow others when they consisted. The hardest part was learning how to work the register but after a good two customers I got the hang of it. The most enjoyable part was coming to work everyday even on my off days."
good,Its a lot of work. Being a CSM has its challenges. I feel like I am constantly running around between customer service and the cashiers trying to take care of customers. I have definitely learned to delegate to make sure things get done. To me being able to laugh with other associates makes the day not so stressful as long as my job gets done.
good,I left the job because of some personal reasons and I would definatly go back. I loved some of my managers and most of my fellow employees. It paid good money and gave me some vacation time.
good,"The atmosphere is always changing. No two days are ever the same. As a salaried member of management I spend most of my time at the store, and there is always something new."
good,i enjoyed working for walmart. The management team was amazing. the night crew i worked with was one the best i have worked with. it was anoverall enjoyable experience
good,i thought it was okay job. i worked overnight then they switched me to mornings. i had more freedom at walmart then the dollar store. i could have a ciggbutt without getting yell at. they fired me because i called out twice and my mom passed away and i didnt file paperwork quick.
good,"A successful day starts with a plan and great communication.  Working with a team that knows what the days expectation is and watching them achieve great results, sets up the next shift for success.  Being the manager that sets this in motion day after day and helps associates promote and reach their true potential is a reward in it self."
good,Very busy all the time always something to do never bored you learn a lot and is always growing everyday a new task to complete the staff treat us fair
good,My only real issue with working there were the inconsistent hours and rude customers. The other employees were all wonderful and the environment was great. I put in my two weeks to move hoping for a better place to live and was sad to go.
good,"Management was very disorganized, they were always stressed out which made their employees stress.The hardest part of the job was learning how to do certain task on your own."
good,I enjoyed my employment in the pharmacy. It was very busy and educating. I learned new things very day. I loved the customers and all the dr.s offices. My boss was great as well as fellow employees.
good,"This job is okay for entry level."
good,I have worked this same job 15 years.I am burned out don't think they are improving the environment and morale at this facility. Also very poor communication between management and hourly employees. Besides decent hoirly wage not a healthy environment.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart however, the experience that you have is all about what type of worker you are as well as, what department you find yourself working in. I personally loved working in housewares because you get more customer questions and less returns. However, when working in the apparel department of the store the job quality becomes significantly lower due to it usually being understaffed."
good,"The work can get monotonous and most of your co-workers are not very motivated.  Walmart is typically a ""job-between-jobs"" that almost none of the entry-level employees can put stock in.  This can be discouraging to you, or it can work to your advantage if you're trying to set yourself apart from the rest and get a promotion."
good,"I appreciate the opportunities that this company has given me.  I was able to work my way up through the company, which is as valuable as a degree.  For people who will go into management without the knowledge of being an associate, they will struggle and have to work hard to learn the lingo and job."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you are not eager to grow up in the company. Hourly wages are very low as compared to other retailers and the work employees do
good,"Unfortunately, I was in a store that had a bad management team most of the time. Too many ""favorites"" while the rest of us had management on us at all times. When we were allowed to do what we needed to do, all was fine, but they would just randomly pull people to do things in other areas, and then yell at you at the end of your shift or the next day for not finishing your own work. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers and answering phone calls. The phone call system isn't the best because it is hard to get members of other departments or management to answer the phone. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with customers that have bad attitudes about products being out of stock. The workplace culture isn't bad either, just dress a little better than the dress code and people will see that you are being professional."
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits"
good,"Retail work, with stocking, moving product, and setting up displays. 40 hour work week, as long as an employee is reliable job security is not an issue."
good,in general its an ok place to work.I learned quite a lot about myself as well as the general public.Most of the management team are ok and are professional.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. My store manager was amazing. The only thing I wish was different was if the management team actually worked together instead of against each other.
good,"Worked well with high school schedule. I did cashiering but it involved more than just that on a daily basis. I also had to work returns, do maintenance on bathrooms, and other small jobs around the store. The managers are willing to work with you if you are a loyal employee and respect them. In my store, if you did jobs that weren't in your description you got a ticket for a free drink or snack."
good,This can be a great place to work. I recommend you start young because at first especially in management you will be required to work long hours with the over night shift taking a huge chunk of your life away.
good,I have a big heart and love to help others.I wouldnt change it for anything just cant wait to be back in the work force.A long with me starting ivy tech for business i know i can bring more to the table.
good,A great place to work as well as a great place to learn if you wanted to. I recommend this job for anyone that's starting out or anyone that want a good company to work for.
good,I work at Wal-Mart now and it's really great. You get a point system that isn't to bad so you know how many days u can get off. It's great for a first job pay wasn't to bad for a first job. Hours were long. 9 hour days 1 hour lunch. 33 hours is like what everyone got. Management there were actually amazing some of course are like the worst but my direct manager as a cashier she was amazing. There are some bad Wal-Mart's out there and I was lucky enough to work at one in south tampa on Handy blvd. One of the best places I work and super chill. I recommend working here if u need some money. Not much but 1000 a month is better then what some pays
good,"Fantastic culture, great message, true belief in work/life balance.  "
good,"The money is great, the opportunity is there, all in all if you have the time and energy to put into this company...they will compensate you for it.  good overall"
good,I was a midnight stocker/cashier  who had to set up and organize shelves as well as bag and take money from customers who were checking out.I greeted people showed them where items were and put a smile on almost every customer face I enjoy working with people period
good,As a company they are not very willing to work with employees. Management comes and goes. New changes weekly. Never any consitancy between management and staff. Wages are lacking for the amount of work was required. Work hours always flucuated.
good,"typical day on the job is honestly not hard at all, anyone and everyone can work at Walmart. What I learned at Walmart was honestly a pretty decent amount of skills that was able to carry on to different jobs."
good,I loved my job. It can be very fast paced. Hours of standing in one spot. They have favorites there. I wasnt one of them. Most dayss customers are very enjoyable. But when a complaint was made it took two weeks to before anything was said to me. Not sure what the delay was
good,Es una empresa grande y te brindan muchas oportunidad!!
good,the coworkers at my walmart in osprey florida were very nice everything was great except for the customers my god were they terrible lazy people cant look for anything lady literally asked me where the garden rakes were well how bout in the garden section? definitely not in the auto care center but theres nothing you can really do about the customers
good,The work was upbeat and challenging. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting to interact with coworkers and customers. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with frozen and dairy. The management could use a little work.Wor
good,I loved working as an unloader/ stocker. The people I worked with daily were lots of fun. As many jobs it came with its own set of stresses and drama but overall this position was gun and looked forward to it daily.
good,I really like the people I worked with but as soon as my neck flared up they just blew me off.A average day at work was fine I really enjoyed working there I really like working with people.
good,"It's a good company to work for, it's just hard balancing life and work. As Walmart expects you to put in 200% and leave your life out of it. It is all about teamwork, perseverance, love of what you do, and the joy of making people happy."
good,"I gained a plethora of customer service experience while working at Walmart.  I enjoyed my manager, who is currently still employed there.  Each day is very relaxed, you are given a small amount of work, so that you can interact with customers more frequently."
good,"hard work dealing with the public, but enjoyed it some what, usually fast pace. Management was okay they had there days, when it got busy they where constantly on your back."
good,Pay isnt good enough for all the work they have you do. Besides dealing with crazy customers its not that bad of a place to work. Never have to work over 40 hours and get 1hr lunch breaks.
good,"I learned that its not easy to help customers and keep a store up and going but I love it. I've learned alot of life experiences and also made new friends and regular customers. I learned how to pierce ears and how to handle with unhappy customers. How to set up and make certain things look nice and clean. But with some things like them "
good,I can't really complain it pays the bills they hired me when I first got down here from ny and I'll always be thankful but I need more it's nothing against walmart
good,I had no problems with my management. No problems with how the work needed to be done. But the only problem I can think of from the company is that growth from your current position doesn't happen rarely. The pay wasn't the best.
good,Iwallmart is agreat company to work for if thats your type of work. the job is fun and coworkers are great to work with. the boss are great and understanding.
good,"Great place to work , good pay , great environment. It was a very good experience and I learned a lot. I world recommend anyone to work there. I'm grateful for the experience"
good,"Walmart is not a bad company to work for, there's just a lot of drama. Working third shift was the best because people were pretty close on that shift. Almost felt like family."
good,"I work in the apparel department and a typical day for me includes making sure the floor is clean and all the clothing is of the floor and hung or folded nicely and put on shelves.it is important to get the returned items put away in the proper place so they can be shopped.  I have learned how to deal with all kinds of customers, rude and friendly. The hardest part of the job is trying to get things done in a timely fashion while being short-staffed. I do enjoy working with my fellow assiciates."
good,"For a big company like Walmart, they have such horrible pay and treats their worker horribly, no outside activity together, working on holidays, no holiday pay. Etc."
good,Walmart was a very good place to work at the people are very awesome very good dental health and life benefits the only thing that i didn't like was the hours and days
good,Lots of hours.  Not very family oriented.   Very demanding depending on the store.  Don't get compensated for the hours you work through holiday and inventory times.
good,"fast pace setting, management was helpful when available. hardest part would be disgruntled customers but great place to work nonetheless. best part of the job was seeing people genuinely thankful for your help."
good,"I was signed on as part-time help, but management regularly had me working 40 hour weeks with no full time benefits. Other employees were very nice and were a pleasure to work with."
good,i loved my job but not everyone did their job so It made it difficult. it tought me how to work quickly. inventory was hard and not fun at all but of course has to be done. I loved helping the customers and meeting new people.
good,"Recebimento de caminhão com conferencia por setores e ajuda de colegas setorizados."
good,I liked walmart because I never got bored there and it payed well too. As well as getting plenty of hours. Also you get two breaks and one hour for lunch which was a bonus if you were there for more than 8 hours.
good,"Walmart has been a wonderful place to work and very understanding when it comes to family obligations. I look forward to the fun, energetic environment that is their daily. Also, the other employees make each day a new adventure making friendships on the way."
good,Consistently  working on stocking shelves and helping customers.  With a wide variety of cultures and understanding what product they needed. I found this very interesting due to the language barrier.  I like helping the customer and giving suggestions of other products that may be available to them.  I learned that customer good customer service makes happy customers that will return.
good,"Fun place to work. Everyday was something new. Management was pretty easy to get along with. Wal-Mart was understanding with family emergencies, sicknesses and deaths."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for they have good benefits for working there a long time, but they should chose their department managers more smartly. After working there for more then a month I finally met my department manager and she was very rude and grumpy even the customers had something about it, and she smelt like cigarettes. But other then that I learned new computer skills and more costumer service skills to help me in my future if I want to stay in the costumer service area."
good,"Buena empresa poca oportunidad de crecimiento, tiene buenas prestaciones solo que tiene gente en nivel muy alto que abusa de su cargo y no dejan crecer en la empresa"
good,"as a cap 1 team member i loved walmart, good vibes, good atmosphere, but i love the grocery store. it was simple cut and dry task, always knew my job."
good,Work was steady and you weren't idle very long. You had mandatory breaks and lunch was included as one of them. I learned how to properly take inventory in a timely and efficient manner. I unfortunately had trouble with a manager who got upset if you were not closer than two inches to him when he was relaying the same daily instructions. I told a manager above him about how he flipped out once but it didn't seem to help much. My other co worker was much better to work with and was often more efficient.
good,Most days are very quick paced.  When there are many customers in the store it's hard to give employees their breaks and lunchs on time.  Some days when we had a couple CSM'S on at the same time I would go on register to decrease the size of the lines. Overall once you start working everything falls into place.
good,worked with the community. got to help with everyone in town. met new people daily. learned strong customer service skills. management was nice except for the bad apple ones. workplace was relaxed and enjoyable to come in to. I had problems with 2 managers one forged my signature on write ups. another would not sign off on me going into management because of a personal conflict we had a year prior
good,"Fun workplace I've gotten a lot of experience there, the employees are mostly nice and friendly, overall a okay place to work, very easy to move up as long as you apply yourself and if you stay for a 20 years you get excellent benefits"
good,"A typical day at work is fun and professional. The things I have learned is how to use a pallet jack, unload the truck, break down the pallets and work the freight. The management is very friendly and very professional. The workplace culture is very people friendly and provides great customer service. The hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with some of the customers problems. Th most enjoyable part of the job is finding out ways to help customers solve their problems and providing the best customer service experience the I can."
good,"Fast paced environment, be prepared to work, if you can deal with the seemingly unfair rules, then you got yourself a fairly good job working 3-4 days a week depending on what shift you work."
good,"I had work for Walmart for a few months as and became a department manage. Wasn't to bad their scheduling could be better."
good,"I enjoy my job here. Get to meet new people everyday  and even get to know the ""regulars"". I have been here for a long time and there are plenty of chances for advancement."
good,I enjoyed working at this Walmart location . The hours were reasonable and I felt appreciated as an employee. The hours were good so I always had a reasonable pay. My manager was great to work with and I had great associates.
good,"We worked  4 on 3 off schedule and then the next week we would work a 3 on 4 off. Work/life balance at its finest! Unfortunately, they decided to move our Logistics Center back to Bentonville, AR. Otherwise, I would still be with the company."
good,"Hard working employers, easy to get along with. Helping customers with what they need, making sure the truck was unloaded and shelves are stocked everyday."
good,"Es gab immer was zu tun und war sehr abwechslungsreich. Einige meiner Aufgaben waren:"
good,"Very challenging at first, but through patience and due diligence, I was able to master my daily tasks and requirements to establish a smooth work environment for myself."
good,"A typical work day started at 9/10pm and included stocking, cashier work, and customer service. I learned how to manage work with being a new mom, in a very enjoyable workplace. The hardest part of the job would have been dealing with people that came in under the influence of alcohol late at night, yet at the same time it could prove to be the best part of the night"
good,great place to work if your a student or have no children but they do work you hard but great advancements and finical gains if your serious about working your way up in this company
good,pues es una empresa que lleva a cabo lo sus politicas
good,"I had the opportunity to work in close proximity to up to six or seven other people who were usually around my age. Though there were often problems with management, particularly in communicating changes or tasks with us the associates, but with the laid-back, easy-going culture we created, it was never a huge stressor. "
good,"Walmart is a very good company to work for!  They offer great benefits, good pay, and a great work environmen!  The employees and staff are amazing people!!"
good,"You will learn anything and everything at Walmart"
good,"If you are a good worker and like to stay busy and be active then Wal-Mart is the place you would want to work for. It is fast pace and active with lots of challenges. If you are look for somethin boring and laid back, then this job is not for you."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was the customer interactions and learning how to work customer service and doing the money orders and seeing how many people will try to scam you. just makes you sharp and aware.
good,I liked working here but I only got about 30 to 38 hours a week with no benefits or vacation. Very friendly management and co-workers. Didn't see much advancement in the company
good,"The management need a lot of work, but the workers are good people. It does good anywhere to not get caught up in work drama but especially at Walmart."
good,"Working at Walmart is not a bad thing, the workers are friendly, the pay is decent for retail and there are lots of opportunities for advancement. As a sales associate, the work was easy and versatile. As you move up in the company though you get less help and not much is explained to you by upper management, you are pretty much on your own with little to no explanation. The company as a whole is implementing measures to try and prevent it but it may take some time. We do have lots of small events like safety parties or monthly birthdays and everyone is pretty close with one another. I loved being busy and having things to do all day everyday but the stress is a little much."
good,"From the moment I clock in I'm assigned a set of aisles to stock, from there we work with the freight and customers that need guiding. Once we finish our aisles we are sent to help others who are not finished. We prep back room at the end of the night for the over night workers and lastly we clean up our work space."
good,Working here was very interesting. My coworkers didn't really believe in teamwork. The managers didn't take many things seriously and they didn't handle issues in a timely manner.
good,"If you like to travel and don't mind the shift you work, this is the job for you! If you have a family or small children I do not recommend this position."
good,"Best company to work in.Team players,friendly workers and supervisors.Helpful managers and good working systems.Clean environment with free goodies like coffee and popcorns."
good,Very fast paced job with short breaks and very little down time. Management was not always the best but as a team we always powered through the hard days and made production.
good,It is a challenging yet satisfying position that rewards people who stay long term. I appreciate my time working there. I am satisfied with the position.
good,"Great company to work for. A typical day you interact with a bunch of different people on a daily. A lot of different cultures. I learned a lot about safety and compliance. The workplace environment is friendly, everybody but the members of management. The hardest part of working for Wal-Mart is dealing with angry customers, and rude managers. The most enjoyable part is getting to satisfy customers."
good,"the hard work for me, i am working in the receiving department and doing all the day stoking and help the customer with different Languages. and i have Experience from this job to help customer and time management teamwork."
good,A typical day at work you come in and start off with taking freight off the truck. You then put the freight into different categories and then take the freight out on the sales floor and stock it.
good,"Empresa visa o crescimento profissional,dando oportunidades para que possamos ter conhecimento em diversas areas"
good,"I checked in on time clock in HR. Went to supply closet got equipment. Cleaned bathroom, took out trash, organized break room, clean lobbies, and did minor repairs to doors or windows."
good,My day consist of going in at 10 pm and getting to work stocking the shelves after a meeting every night and then getting off around 7 am.  You get to work alone which can be nice but at the same time it can get kind of boring.
good,Working at walmart provided a great experience for a first job and is a strongly recommendable place for employment. It's a place full of welcoming smiles and diversity.
good,"Work could be stressful at times, i learned about our vendors and their reps. Management could have been better with their relationships with employees which developed into an us versus culture. The hardest part og the job was Black Friday, and when the sunday fliers broke. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customer and setting them up with what they needed."
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar pero desafortunadamente me tocó convivir con un equipo de gerencia sin escrúpulos a la hora de dar oportunidades de crecimiento, pero las prestaciones son muy buenas y existen casos de trabajadores que logran crecer dentro de la empresa"
good,el trabajo era tranquilo por las mañanas aprendi a elaborara bebidas y snacks asi como dar servicio en piso de ventas mis compañeros eran muy amables
good,It is an organization that allows you take ownership of your career. There is always something to do to become better and deliver results. There are resources all around you to support your learning and career path.
good,Meu primeiro emprego. Treinei com ótimas pessoas e tive um excelente ambiente de trabalho. Aprendi sobre diversidade e tolerância devido às pessoas maravilhosas que estavam ao meu redor. A gerência sempre foi presente e faça espaço para nossas opiniões e ouviam críticas de modo construtivo.
good,Great Place to work and learn.  The associates are great people many with 15 plus years with Walmart . The inventory processes are great in replenishing stock on a consistent basis.
good,I worked here briefly when I applied I was getting ready to move for college and they promised to transfer me to a work place closer to school however when I was getting ready to go the manager yelled at me and said I shouldn't have even applied there and made me cry so they suck.
good,"days at walmart are pretty simple, our taks are laid out for the shift so were able to complete our task in timely matter. the work place productive and competive."
good,Walmart's top management was professional and most often trustworthy. The middle management seemed more and more flippant - quite discouraging. The employee reviews were done yearly and were based on store profit - not performance - so  associates quit or kept floating through different departments.
good,Would like to experience other careers..I like my job..Just time for a change..Been there 7 months and haven't had much time off..They don't rotate the schedule like they should..
good,Very busy with stocking work area with incoming shipment and keeping area clean and covering other areas if we were short staffed on some occasions you could leave early
good,There were plenty of opportunities to advance and they actually payed fairly based on your work ethic. If you were a hard worker you got an increase in pay at your annual review.
good,Walmart is a great place to work as long as you have a strong and I worked for Walmart for four years. The only thing that I didn't like is when it comes to family they have no response its either you on our time or get lost..
good,was never told that you were doing your job good or if there was any chance of moving up. they always were there to tell you what you were doing wrong and they weren't very much help when needed
good,"Me encanta trabajar en walmart, solo que deberían de tomar an cuenta mas a las personas que si trabajan,y dar mas horas a quien de verdad trabaja bien"
good,"Very busy during weekends, first of the month, and holidays good people to meet some may be a little rude but one walmart has taught is to keep calm and go about your work day."
good,"Its typically a 9 hour day job, but you get two paid 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch. Management could be better. Short staffed often because management doesn't schedule enough people. I enjoy the customers and the fact they work with my life schedule. However when short staffed, customers take it out on you even when you have nothing to do with it."
good,empresa excelente na questão de oportunidade de crescimento
good,Helpful alot.fun to meet new people.good work out being a team captain.need to be really responsible.come on time.do what u suppose to.working with others.
good,"my day started with ,me getting a walkies talkie and strapping it to my waist and going outside to collect carts and bring them back to the bay. every now and agian they needed someone to do a carry out for a big item and i would carry it all the way to the customers car. job was really simple"
good,This was my founding career. I had mentors who saw in me more than I did in myself. The time and training invested has formed the manager I am now. The only reason I left is I had no desire to be moved away from my family for the second time.
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs up to date, I really liked the whole job. Met some cool people, didn't like the management so much though. Hate I lost that job."
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and waiting to see what register I would be on, or what CBLS I needed to get done. Then working with customers to make sure they had a satisfied shopping exxperience. I learned alot from this store. The most important one being communication. You can't learn things if you don't ask questions. The managers were very open to talk to, even if they were busy with other things. The hardest part of the job is working when the registers get packed because customers get agitated when there were long lines."
good,"Repair customers watch bands, Replace batteries, Phone operator, Lay away sales, I worked with a group great employees that made the day go by fast. Good Management Team."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work at, managers were nice, cap team 2 in which I worked was a very productive team and we got alot of work done, and they were all nice and willing to teach me alot when I started."
good,"Un buen ambiente  laboral de acuerdo  al tipo de administración . tuve  buenos colegas  buena jefatura adquirí  conocimientos en  varias secciones del local , buenos  beneficios para los trabajadores buena experiencia laboral y espiritual ."
good,"From the time I clocked in, my job was fast paced, lots of customers, time management, trying to find the happy medium between measurements for glasses and walk in repairs and still learning different aspects of what was required of me for my understanding of how to help the constant flow of customer needs. I learned about different glass styles, how to measure in order for the patient to be able to see correctly, how to handle customers that felt like their needs were not being met. I worked with knowledgeable associates but the manager was not trained well and did not seem to be a very good fit for his title. The hardest part of the job was the interoffice politics and scheduling conflicts and not being trained well enough to be left alone after only one shift and not being able to help the customers thoroughly. I enjoyed helping the customers when I knew how. The customers that tried their new glasses on for the first time and their reaction to having better or clearer vision was a wonderful feeling for all of us."
good,this was my very first job coming out of high was kinda hard to get use to but i got the hang of it going to school all day the work at night introduce me to the real world
good,"The company is very good and has a lot available to employees as far as benefits and actually relatively reasonable ability to get days off-if you know 6 months in advance AND they like you. You start at $(/hour and are bumped up to $10 after a few months, which is nice in combination with their willingness to work every legally available second of your time. Also very good about making sure you take breaks and lunch times as long as they notice you are there. Management is deplorable due to a lack of communication and organization as well as a seeming lack of knowledge regarding the parts of a store they are supposed to be working for."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart in the cash office and running the registers it was fun and got to meet new people in the cash office I felt like I was important and people needed me
good,Very flexible with scheduling and always felt respected and appreciated for my work. The job can be as stressful as any retail job but management is friendly and helpful.
good,"Empresa que tende a ser rigorosamente pontual com. Salário, busca o desenvolvimento do funcionário."
good,"It's a pretty good place to work at. They have great benefits even for part-timers. There is a bit of a problem with the management though. When there are rumors, some managers escalate the problem instead of toning it down. Under-staffing is also a frequent problem."
good,This job was a good stepping stone for me. I did not have much experience when I started here. The management team was great to me. They taught me a lot.
good,"Nice place to work at. At times"
good,"I started at Walmart as an unloader my job was to unload trucks. Then 2 months later i got certified to use the forklift and walkie staker. Then, after 6 months they got me in charge of the unloaders were. Then 3 years later i moved to IMS were my responsibility was to make sure inventory was correct. Than 2 years after i became an electronics associate were i learn customer service. And also how to do remodeling and resets."
good,"Work smart, hard and consistent and you may be first in line for promotions. This Walmart Store offers a family like feeling; coworkers appear to mostly be very friendly to each other same for the management."
good,"Working the service desk can be a rewarding day. You deal with an array of customers. Some are paying bills, sending money, cashing checks, purchasing money orders, returns and exchanges. We also deal with angry and upset customers. It can be a very stressful day, if you don't handle the customer right. The main thing is to listen, look at them and listen."
good,"Llegada al trabajo, limpieza general, inventarios, cambios de precios, cierre del sistema walmart, aux cajero, mantenimiento en el area de piso ventas"
good,never know what to expect from customers could be good or bad. great management HR is kinda lacking. As long as you can deal with customers its a good place to work
good,I looked forward to going to work. I learned that hard work pays off. Management was great as long as you didn't need to take a sick day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with new people everyday.
good,the hardest part of the job is the support managers once they get that title it goes over there head and forget about respect and believe that we are lower them
good,"As a Manager I experienced a lot.. Dealing with customers, store planning,P&L's,Budgets, scheduling, Merchandising, coaching, training associates, etc."
good,Its a great place to work you are able to learn a lot  of different areas . The customers are great to help . i enjoy  the fast and friendly and clean service
good,working for walmart improved my customer service skills by being able to answer customers questions and provide them with  excellent customer service.
good,I started out on overnights and worked my way to days in the connection center and electronics. It was a fantastic opportunity at that time and I really enjoyed the environment and work family.
good,Walmart was a great environment to work in it had great people and great benefits. I will miss working there but I need to move own and find a better outlook for myself
good,This was a good entry level position into the work force. It taught valuable skills in customer service and retail that could be used later with new work ventures.
good,"interacting with customers daily helping in situations that i can, the hardest part is getting to know the register when you first start after that its a breeze"
good,"Enjoy working with a wide range of diverse areas and associates. You can be working in the service areas i.e. Bakery, Deli, Sporting Goods, or the Garden, then you can be in the back in receiving then up front helping with customer service or in the cash office. "
good,Working at the distribution center has been a great experience for me since leaving the military. I have learned quite a bit from my civilian associates. The one thing I can say needs attention is the management Walmart has running their warehouse. Management as a whole needs help. They have a lot of first time managers who don't know how to manage people. None of them know how to do the job they are over so going to them for help is nearly impossible. There were times I had to find out answers to my work related questions by myself. Being in the military gave me the training to figure out my own matters but that's what your managers are there for. The job is easy compared to what I did for 24 years but the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I interact with on a daily basis.
good,"This was my first job and I did not know what to expect, the training was fast, easy and simple and time flew by, and the pay was good. Management was picky about what rules to enforce and often resulted in confusion but I was part-time so I didn't really care. I'd recommend it for a starter job but not for a career."
good,"worked very hard to make sure jobs were completed on time, trucks were unloaded as required. Work was piled on the managers to complete if associates failed to do so. Being Manager had its benefits for example being able to assist associates with work and making sure they knew what was expected from them. The hardest part of the job was budget cuts while work loads kept getting bigger. The most enjoyable part of the job was celebrating bonus outcomes from profit increase year after year."
good,It's a steady paycheck with plenty of room for advancement.  Schedule was easy to have changed if needed. Management typically is very uncaring of family emergencies.
good,"Incredible company to work for.  However, the management team needs a lot of work and impreovement.  There are lots of opportunities for growth and many different career paths to choose from."
good,"overall Walmart is a great place to work no place is perfect usually very busy and fast paced.  typical day consist of checking customers out and helping them find the items they are looking for, creating an enjoyable experience. hardest part of the job was getting someone to relieve me for lunch. Most enjoyable part was working mostly independent and being trusted and the hourly pay was great."
good,"I was told would be fulltime and would learn their procedures and how their expectations of what customer service should be , and three months later went to lay off."
good,I liked working here because hours were good for me to spend time with family management was cool..Hardest of the job co workers wasnt really nice.bue benefits were great
good,There Are A lot of ways to move up in the company at Walmart.Its a very even paced work place.The management is great they help you with anything you need.
good,Work at Walmart can be fulfilling and good for young folks starting out in the work world. Good for experience with the public. Management changes often.
good,"Long nights, incompetent workers. What's not to love about working for Walmart?  It's a big, big corporation with $$ as their bottom line. If you aren't productive, don't work here."
good,"stocking, price changes, inventory auditing, setting up displays and plenty of customer service. Management has been known to be very demanding and sometimes your best is just never good enough. The hardest part about being a department manager is coming in at least 4 of my 5 days a week at 630 am and seeing many of the third shift associates goofing off rather than stocking the 20 to 30 pallets of freight left over from the previous nights truck. Third shift never seems to be held accountable for their constant lack of productivity."
good,"very hectic and sometimes confusing  . I usually enjoy shoppig in that same shop so i figured it will be a great opportunity to join the team and friendly staff, hard part of the job was dealing with customers while stocking shelves"
good,"people were nice at the store I worked at."
good,"While working for Walmart, I made a lot of close work friends while enjoying my job. I loved working with the customers, even on the bad days. I enjoyed the job so much I even came back for a second round. The typical day of work started early for me, setting up my register and putting on a smile, I got along with all of management which was super easy because everyone was very friendly and helpful if a problem ever arose. I think the hardest part of the job was when a customer came in who we couldn't help due to various reasons, because we strive to help the customers as much as possible. The Walmart I worked at became a home away from home, and i'll always know that they made my work experience so great and gave me so many learning tools."
good,"My time at walmart was a good experience. I learned a lot of new things about customer service. I also enhanced my scanning/bagging skills, in a quick and organized manner"
good,"A empresa Wal Mart é uma empresa boa para se trabalhar,mas tem seus contras por que não tem oportunidade de crescimento la dentro."
good,Enjoyed my time with Walmart. Love my customers and my teammates that i worked with. Enjoyed the experience the i had with them over the years that i was there.
good,I had good  assistant managers bad support managers. All ways had 40 hours a week two 15 min brakes and  hour lunch and 10% discount can't complain about that overall I liked it.
good,I was able to meet new people and help them while shopping and giving advice. I did very little cashier work which I was disappointed about. I love to do office work and that wasn't available for me. On the positive note there was always something that needed to be done and you were kept busy.
good,The management over me didn't want to help. The management didn't know what they were doing. They were no where to be found when you needed them. Overall the experience i had working their was bad.
good,Usually when I come in until I leave at the end of my shift I work constantly.  The training itself is sometimes not where it needs to be especially when given a new position.
good,Walmart is a very fun and enjoyable workplace to work at. The management does make their employees feel welcome. You will have to restock inventory on a constant basis. You will also be moved around in different departments as well.
good,"Walmart is a great job most of the time and you must be able to separate home life from professional life. Management doesn't handle things very well because they are not treated very well. Best way to make it at Walmart is to go to work, give 100% and then go home and do it all over the next day. Learn your store and move around as much as possible. Do not be afraid to move up."
good,"Came in did dept counts, turned in reports to management, worked daily freight, mark downs, inventory control, general customer service when needed. Enjoyed working there."
good,"I enjoyed the job, despite its inherent problems. I can however understand and accept the short comings of a billion dollar corporation such as Walmart. They simply are too big to have proper treatment of their employees."
good,"I really loved working at Walmart and wouldn't mind going back! My coworkers were like family and I wasn't miserable going to work, I truly enjoyed what I did everyday."
good,"Walmart was my first job, they had me working until 12 and having to be to work the next day at 6:30 am. I got accused of being high because of my bloodshot eyes. Plus you have to sit in front of a computer and watch videos about things you already know. It's not a very good first job in my opinion"
good,"I made a lot of friends at Walmart.  Managers were often hard to deal with.  I would often get called to cashier, push carts, or help other departments and even though I always got my job finish I got questioned about where I was.  Trust goes two ways in a relationship, including a manager-underling relationship. The last time I worked for Walmart I got paid a really low wage because they only count Walmart experience."
good,"Walmart for the most part is a great place to work. A lot of systems are in place to treat the hourly associates as fairly as possible. Management is a different story. I think Walmart is trying to replace the older management with new younger people. They have changed the schedules so they are harder for older management. They raised the starting rate for management, giving raises to the newer hires and managers who have been there the longest received no raise. I was capped out for four years and after the new salary structure, my pay was that of a just under mid range paid manager, even though I've been a manager for eighteen years."
good,Good working environment. Great co workers and supervisors. Enjoy working with my co workers and supervisors. The superstore that i work at makes working there very enjoyable and relaxing.
good,"fun way to interact with management while enjoying a nice work environment.                   "
good,You can't chose your family but when it comes to your co workers you find out quick who's more than just another associate punching a time card. I've had ups and downs in my 2 years and I've had a great time with the associates I work with.
good,"The work day tends to fly by, I have had some wonderful managers who were always willing to work with me when I got into a bind. I have never been shorted on my hours."
good,"It's a good job to work at when you're out of school but as a student it can be difficult. Walmart offer great pay,experience, and improvement for future work"
good,"Walmart was okay. The pay was kind of substandard ($7.25) when I worked there. The management where I worked wasn't to great however. Overall though, Walmart was a good place to work."
good,Really depends on the department you work in. Learn how to clean the deli and how to time manage everything. Also learn how to handle cash. A lot of new management from when I was there heard from the people that do work there now management is great.
good,"Very easy job, management can be ok at times, the workplace culture is great and the people you meet are definitely interesting. Just be prepared to do the same thing over and over again. If the mundane interests you then Wal-Mart is your place to go."
good,Reconhece e promove os funcionarios. Dá chance de crescimento.
good,"My job with Walmart was always fun. I enjoyed my department but thought it was unfair I had to take on 2 different departments alone, I feel this job would be a little more enjoyable if the employees took on an equal amount of tasks."
good,"very productive and  steady paced. Walmart is a great company to work for. Walmart gives back to their community, observes  diversity of their communities and sell products accordingly. Walmart has wonderful managers but the job is very repetitive and not as challenging as I would like."
good,"Good place to work, but the management was not that great. My manager was a bully and did not care about the workers at all. She is no longer working there!"
good,"Coming into working starting one things that need to be done , i've learned new ropes and shared new ideas. A good workplace to work hard and save money up."
good,aprendi a bodeguear mejor a tener un buen acomodo de bodegas
good,too many rude customers who just judge you. got rude teens messing with stuff. just stand in one spot. boring and a lot of old co workers with interesting things to talk about.
good,"Working at walmart, you have to be very flexible and willing to change tasks without advance notice during your shift. However they do provided good benefits."
good,Walmart is a great place to work and move around to other positions. I would like to apply for a management position but first I will like to learn about other areas before I apply for a more serious position. I want to  make sure that I know how the company handle different areas before applying.
good,"My day included scanning groceries for customers, greeting them, and sometimes making sure my line stayed clean and presentable. Very simple job and easy to work."
good,The managers are very knowledgeable for the most part and are very helpful in answering your questions. The customers are constant so job security is a plus!
good,Good place to start off your career. Takes time to build up. But hard work pushes trough. Management can be a little hard to get trough depending on the store.
good,"My day would begin at 9:00 PM. I would clock in, and the whole night crew would gather in the manager's office for a briefing of where everyone would be that particular night. From there, we would go to our assigned position and begin working. Being part of the night shift, I would be responsible for stocking the shelves of my department, and taking care of any cardboard that accumulated during said task. I would have a 1 hour lunch and then get back to work until the shift ended at 6:00 AM."
good,"I was working on overnights so I did with many people, I stocked the frontend with bags clean the register and did adpt 82 stuff at night. Also watch the frontend and help on the stock floor."
good,"Overall it is a very nice place to work. The work itself is manageable, breaks are appropriate, hour lunch is amazing, helping customers is great, coworkers were awesome. As an entry level employee the pay was very low, barely above minimum wage. At least at the time of my employment it was sub-par. In 2 weeks I made the same as what I made in 1 week at my factory job. Other than pay, my only complaint was the management of my department. My supervisor was very bipolar and unprofessional at times, but that has been corrected since I have left so it is not an issue anymore. Besides pay, it is a great place to work."
good,"A empresa é uma multinacional, os colaboradores adquirem ampla experiencia, são multifuncinais. "
good,"Disponivel a trabalhar e aprender novas funcoes. "
good,Its a very nice company to work for. They will work with you and your schedule. I have had multiple times where a manager was more than willing to help me personally in and out of the work place.
good,"Stocking was my job and I'm very petite which caused me to be slower than some others. Unloading trucks and pulling freight was really hard"
good,Working at wal-mart was a great start & good experience to my work life but I felt it needed more safety because I feared for my life after the 2 shootings that had occured out side of the store in a area where I was working(Cart-Pushing).
good,the work is easy and the management is okay not the greatest but tolerable. cashier is the best position i think at walmart also the easiest. electronics is okay but theres alot to learn in that department
good,"wal mart distribtion was a good job overall, although I didn't agree with everything, I worked great hours and had great associates. It has its pros and cons like any other jobs."
good,Walmart is a great company overall. There are ups and downs with the company itself. The hours can be cut randomly and it's hard when being in school and working for the company due to schedule complications.
good,Good place to work and friendly people to work with. All in all this store is more organized then most i have been at. Supervisors are friendly and helpful.
good,"Food operations assisted in budgets/ financial performance, forcasted sales and scheduling.  Serv Safe Certified, managed the cost departments and weekly inventories."
good,"I was working in the Wasco during its overnight trail period, their was a lot of product to because everyone was going to the new store. Pretty much just putting items out that the trucks brought in that night."
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Walmart but their Policy on occurences is a lot to be desired. My co-workers were friendly and as well as some of the other associates that I worked with, but still as with all jobs there is gossip and those that have the tendency to nose in your business and spread rumors."
good,Working in a face environment was good for me. Got to deal with different personalities and cultures. The customers we had weren't always pleasant but it prepared me for future jobs.
good,Not a hard job to do i like that i had a set schedule and hour lunch breaks also nice to get a 10% employee discount and 20% after black Friday all and all not a bad place to work
good,A typical day at work was steady. I've learned a lot of customer service and how to scan products and also learned to remember different codes. The management was amazing. Work place was diverse. Hardest part was Black Friday. The most enjoyable part was doing the mannequin challenge with my managers.
good,"i worked there for 4 years. i started as a cashier and became a customer service supervisor in 6 months. Everything was great at that point. Everything changed when the store manager at the time got promoted and a new store manager stepped in. There was manager brought in that had little knowledge on what to do in certain situations. I had to train a few salary based managers. Some managers there were good, knew what they were doing and were fair with everyone. Then there was others that were self centered and played favorites with certain associates, for example giving associates certain days off when there is no coverage but will not give it to another associate. Also giving associates position they do not deserve but only get because they are close friends with that manager."
good,"Walmart is a company that you can find yourself working at for 25 years.  The job it definitely what you put into it as opposed to what you take from it.  The right attitude goes a long way, after all it is customer service.  Take care of your customer and Walmart will take care of you...."
good,A good place to start out working. Alot of great people come in and out everyday. Some days can be better then others but time goes by fast and smooth when you are interacting with customers every minute.
good,"Started working in 2000 with Walmart Canada worlds largest retailer "
good,I actually enjoyed this job. Its a great start to having to deal with customers. You get to learn customer service and how to interact with the public. If everyone did their part this place would be fantastic. The only downside is that the upper management seems to not really care about the average employee. For a high school or college student this is a great first choice.
good,The work is easy enough.  Good breaks and lunch periods. They do not allow any overtime.  They do not play around with tardiness and missing work.  I enjoyed working there and hated to lose the job
good,"Most of the time at Walmart was fine, my immediate department manager and store manager were great. It's the other managers that try to have you do their work, and a good percentage of the customers LOVE to yell at you on a daily basis... at least that's how it is in AP"
good,"A pretty good place to work, after having been there for a while the day to day started to get a bit boring. Management was split between those who wanted to help associates and those who gave no quarter for any reason. Pay was good even as a part-time employee."
good,"Good pay for college students, but its hard to make a living on. The workers are friendly but there is a lot of hiccups that could and should be ironed out."
good,"Easy to learn position duties, friendly environment and work place.Some CSS team members are helpful and respond to request quickly. The hardest part is lifting extremely heavy items. Sometimes I have to make multiple request to finish my and was able to go ,as a result I fell behind and have not caught up  I need to be done before my 90 day review which will be in one week."
good,They tend to only hire part-time but once in the doors and prove you are a valuable associate they take that in consideration.  A great place for advancement and training.
good,"Necesitan subir el salario,"
good,"The hardest part about my job as a customer service manager is you have to know everything, management don't help out like they should. You can meet great people to work with though"
good,"Very good company to work for. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone. I would also recommend this job for anyone who wants to"
good,"Company-wide scheduling cut hours almost in half. It does pay well though, so that's a major plus. Get decent length breaks. For an 8 hour shift, you get 2 15 minute breaks and 1 one hour break."
good,It is a very big place to work. There is plenty of opportunities to move up in the store. The routines that have to be done everyday keeps you very busy.
good,"Decent place to work with decent compensation depending on where and what shift you work.  My work hours in my department were constantly cut short so our paychecks and earned PTO were cut short.  Workmates were mostly high quality.  I got along well with everyone including management. "
good,What is a job where disputes are handled in house. Where unions are disavowed.where hope and indviduality seems lost.i will say nothing more but it was a job a fine paying job for someone with no talents and little work experience.
good,empresa excelente de trabalhar com uma ótima gerencia
good,"A good store to work in, very friendly people and management. They try to be understanding with difficult situations. The only thing I would knock this store for is they tend to pull people from other stores and clubs rather then promote from within. All promotions I have seen from within seem to be favoritism, or that no one else wanted the position."
good,The associates make the job worth while.  You have the opportunity to meet and create a work family.  You can grow and advance as fast or as slow as you would like.  There are always opportunities opening.
good,enjoyed working there great company great people enjoyed my job and supervisers as well as the friendly and up beat environment of the work place it was a really good job
good,"Was a Cashier, enjoyed the work, ended up getting promoted to meat associate, it was a good job that treated me fairly most of the time. Overall, I think it's a good job for a high school kid."
good,I really like working for walmart. Walmart is a company in with someone with little to no Experience can grow. Walmart has a way to teach there associates so that each
good,"I at least learned how to use different equipment, and met new people. overall good place. the one thing I would change if I could is the amount of hours they give the employees"
good,It was a good experience and really was great practice when dealing with a fast paced environment. It was my first real job on my own and I had trouble with my attendance and was unfortunately released but I was an amazing employee and did my best every shift.
good,"Overall, Wal-Mart is a great place to work. The only problem I have with Wal-Mart is their management style. They are uncoordinated and only fix problems if you constantly ask multiple times. I was however able to better my customer service skills. The hardest part of my job was getting the freezer freight out of the big freezer and down-stacking it into our much smaller freezer. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers. They always made me feel welcome."
good,"Great place to work if you have to work over night, we had the best management on the night shift, worked with team players, the atmosphere felt like a safe workplace."
good,"Nice staff members, very kind. There are only 3.5 occurences allowed including tardy, late arrivals, and call outs with in a six month period. Walmart does not explain that upon hiring that pathways a computer training is required that may last up to 5/more days to complete upon being on the floor. It can take up to 3-6months to graduate pathways. Your raise does not begin until graduation from the program. Otherwise, plan your schedule in advance as you receive it from the store three weeks in advance."
good,"Mejorar el ambiente laboral, para que los empleados se sientan a gusto laborando ahí y sea mas fácil su desarrollo laboral."
good,I arrived for third shift and took over a register. We changed out the registers by midnight collecting all the registers storewide and changing out the ATM. We were usually busy until about 2am. then did lunch breaks.carts of returns. many times they took us away from the registers to work other departments stocking or straightening. we also cleaned and straightened the front end and put away the never ending. Usually we only saw management when they bought their lunch or about 5am when they start panicking because we don;t have everything done because we are short of help and  business has started picking back up so we have to stay on a register. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and getting to know and anticipate the needs of the regulars
good,"Walmart is where I learned almost everything I know about retail. They did not become the biggest retailer for no reason. Some of the best managers/ mentors I have ever known are with Walmart. However, some of the worst managers I have ever known are with Walmart. That might be anywhere you go, though. Walmart is a good company, fast paced, great place to learn about retail."
good,"You can put aside everything you think you know about Walmart. And I will cut to the chase: If you are determined, have a good work ethic, and aren't just standing around, you will enjoy your time with this company."
good,"I love the people that I worked with here, although, the claim that there is plenty enough plus some space to move up in this company is a bunch of lies."
good,"I had great hours, car accident came about and nobody understood therapy hours or college hours of being a full student. They don't accept work excuses and my hours were scheduled for times when my classes would begin."
good,Walmart has always been good to me personally. My managers have always helped me become a better employee with more knowledge to exceed expectations and to possibly grow higher with the company.
good,An awesome place to work as far as work goes. Management however is very peeve land in every employees work day. Too few of regular employees and too many managers. If you've ever wondered why there's only two cashiers it's because for every 1 manager you can hire five of them and rest assured there's 4-5 managers in the back.
good,I enjoyed my time at WalMart but it would've been better if the company would look into taking care of their employees instead of Walmart. Hard working employees aren't taken care of at Walmart. That's it.
good,"wal-mart is a great company to work for nut the management in columbus, ga on victory dr, they cannot manage anything but the workers are nice and it can be a good company to work for."
good,"A fairly straight forward work basis day to day kind of thing."
good,"Overall, a decent place to work. The hours can drag on, but the reward of helping out a customer will make it feel worth it. Most of the staff is friendly, but it sometimes can feel busy and isolated at the same time."
good,"Good place and environment. Have to work a lot of hours for your pay. Sometimes up to  14 hours per day. Worked as a casual driver for them. Like to try something different, perhaps something with more contact with people."
good,"The Walmart culture is unique and has been for many years. As one of the largest retailers, much of their leadership has been created internally. There is a significant gap from management to employee and this impacts how service is provided and advancement in the company."
good,walmart isnt a bad place to work depends who ur boss is and what shift you work i worked third n didnt mind it didnt like my boss and she didnt like me ether so wasnt that fun
good,A typical day at work I would go in and clean the aisles and face the shelves. I made sure that I stocked the shelves. The hardest part about the job is making card board bales .
good,"During the start of my day I would clock in, get to a register, and start ringing up customers. After awhile I would then clock out for break and go hang out or get lunch, and then I would clock back in until it was time to go home."
good,"Started working as a cashier then moved to working at the service desk which was a step up in pay, then moved to layaway with another increase in pay. Then they opened a deli and I moved to that department, where I learned how to do price changes, place orders for products needed to deep the deli running, removed out of date product, cooked food, sliced meat and cheese for the customers. The store manager was very friendly and communicated well with the employees."
good,"This job seems to depend on your crew, If you are working with a group that are working together toward the goal, your experience will be great. I have been fortunate to find a great group here."
good,it is a good company to work for but each store has its own advantages and disadvantages as well as favouritism in each store as well advancing in walmart comes with a lot of sucking up to the currnet management
good,Ability to leave work at word when you leave. Management was supportive of advancement. work week was flexible and well managed. co-workers were friendly.
good,"One great thing is that they are willing to work around your school schedule. If you plan on having certain days off, it is best to plan those days at least 30days in advance"
good,"Foi um experiencia boa do tenho a agradecer a oportunidade q mim deram..."
good,My experience with Walmart was rewarding and complementary to my skills. I learned allot about retail and had a pleasant experience with my co-workers and management.
good,"Being on top of shoplifting and checkout lines was the main part of my day. I learned how to do money services, Lotto, How to open and close the store, Do accounting paperwork, Order things, Reset the shelves, and Stoking. Some of the management team were not properly educated on how to run the store. Hardest part was stopping the shoplifters. Enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,Walmart is a god job for the money. I would just like to be more proactive and work for something. Moving up was an issue do to being a college student.
good,"In my experience the customers are usually what makes it difficult. As a cashier we interact with many more customers than sales associates of course, and most of my coworkers who aren't cashiers seem to enjoy working for Walmart."
good,They were a good company to work for years ago. Now it's changed so much. Management can be a hassle because there is so many to many chiefs not enough Indians
good,"Working at Walmart as a supervisor was a good experience for me, friendly associates, multi diverse enviroment. Helping customers when asked a question made me feel good to know I helped make a positive difference in their day."
good,Fellow Co-workers were always courteous and Cooperative. Good work hours and Management. Some days were more busy than others because of More freight.
good,Cool and productive. Easy to move up if manager likes you. Pays every two weeks but offers great handy benefits. Flexible hours and college and high school friendly.
good,"Go in and have start up meeting and stretching"
good,I usually work 10pm to 7am. i mostly work in the frozen dairy section. i have learned a lot of time management and organizational skills while working here. the hardest part of my job is really heavy stocking nights. the easiest part of my job is dealing with customers.  the management is very friendly as long as you work hard and come to work. the environment is friendly.
good,"It was okay management was awful there. When I was working there I pretty much had to do my job my supervisor job, had to be a cashier when needed, They never had anything the way it should have been."
good,Was a steady fun place to work very interactive with people on a regular basis Management was ok the assistant managers were helpful but the store manager was very unkind and demanding at all times
good,I loved working for walmart. I worked in several areas. I love to learn new things. Fast paced enviroment. Great place if youre able to move up and they work with you on hours.
good,This job taught me a lot about the legal ins and outs of building in other state. I was able to travel and learn a lot about real estate and design. I enjoyed this job however I was along way from my family
good,Walmart is okay place to work for someone that is very people person i work in the deli i loved it i would go back if needed to i have two children and my family is first
good,"A typical day at work inquires patients, unloading, and major preparations. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to please and put a smile on customer faces."
good,"Great place too work. Job is pretty simple and easy going. Managers are very laid back as long as you are getting the job done. Co-wokers mostly stick to themselves, overall a great place to work"
good,"The work kept me busy, but there were several times where there was either too much or too little. The best part about it were the people I was able to work with,"
good,There are many great people there to work with.  The job itself is enjoyable however some of the stress it comes with is not.  The management team over all is good to work with.
good,Very good customer service. Fun workplace. Very comfortable to work you feel at home. Met alot of nice people. Everyone is so caring and nice. I loved working there.
good,Great beginner retail pharmacy for my experience. Fast paced but with proper training I learned alot with my first pharmacy job. Ive been working for almost 2 years and for the most part my job is enjoyable. (minus some stressful days)
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you need a good paycheck and something to have until you start your career. Its easy to work your way up and advance as well, however every job has their flaws and I believe the flaws at Walmart is that home office forgets that their employees have personal lives and sometimes things happen. Their occurrence roll over policy is too strict and its one of the main reasons they have such a huge turn over. Also their upper management needs work and improvement. Other than that I would still recommend part timers to try Walmart out since they are a good place for a part time job. However, if you have a hard time with having management constantly breathing down your neck and expecting way more then what you are capable of then it might not be the place for you as it can be quite stressful and demanding."
good,"En mi último puesto, las personas con las que conviví son geniales. Tanto mis jefes directos cómo mis pares, me enseñaron mucho y me hice de buenos amigos."
good,"I have not work at Walmart in over 13 years, I honestly only remember a few of the staff members, the location I worked I moved around departments quite a bit and gained experience from each department."
good,Wal-Mary was a good place to work. You had a lot of freedom to do what you needed. Tbh if I would have worked it while I was in san marcos I honestly would have stayed.
good,"Empresa Walmart é uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, pois proporciona oportunidades de crescimento e aprendizagem, e tem também um ambiente agradável para se trabalhar."
good,"I love working here, but the pay for my hard work doesn't cut it. I love my boss and put my all into my work but when my coworkers who goof off and dont work halg as hard as I get paid $2-$3 more than me, its not right."
good,a typical day at work long and hard.what i learned is that you have to stay focus at all times never lose site that.Also the manager and management are a handfull at times
good,"Overall it was a fun place to work, but moral in general was low.  Management really, as well as the assoccitates, were not trained well. In some cases no training at all."
good,The culture is a great part of working at Walmart.  The servant leadership and focus on development of Associates is a great benefit to being employed at Walmart.
good,"this job sucks hated walmart .very rude and controlling .walmart got a training system on the computer and they are call pathway and u have 18 months to complete they if u are not by that time come u can get fire,but managemeni never let anyone do they pathway becaues they want everyone to stock items for 8 hours and that;s noy fair i want a job i got a family to feed"
good,I'd say typical day at work is almost everyday i learned things in my job as how to help other associate if help needed the hardest part of the job is when I'm in a bad moody way
good,Though management was stereotypical management. The job was fun and a fun atmosphere.  Good outweighed bad heavily.  They are big on teaching their employees.  If you have questions they want you to ask.  Fellow employees are friendly and social.  Was a quality experience.
good,"Easy to move up. Good job security alot of drama.large employee turn around. Hard workers have to take up the slack for slow workers, long and bad hours."
good,The inventory management position was very fast paced. Consisted of unloading two or three semi trailers every night. Working nights makes you exhausted the rest of the day.
good,"Overall, Walmart is a good company to work for. They give you paid breaks, vacation, a discount, insurance, etc. You just have to find the right store to work for."
good,walmart is a great company.. just don't want to pay enough.management team should be more communitive. there should be know favoritism in a company like this.
good,"Working for Walmart for 2 years, I learned a great number of things and learned quickly when assisting other departments such as sporting goods. As an employee who was allowed flexible hours to take college courses, I greatly appreciate this from Walmart."
good,you choose your work availability a typical day can vary from  fast paced to slow paced. At WALMART yu get 3 breaks two are 15minute breaks and one is either a hour break or a 30minute break. WALMART works with students.
good,"Most all positions are fairly to very active. you are always on your feet so you need to were food shoes. You are always working Holiday which makes it hard if you are a family person. Some positions have set schedules most of the time, others you may end up working random days."
good,Working at walmart is a great job for someone just starting out or looking for something  to do after retirement. Walmart can improve on some management issues. In my opinion there should be better communication between managers so that customers are getting helped faster
good,"Great job learned a lot on my first couple of hours of work"
good,"Generally a good starting job, good flexible hours. Easy to get comfortable and to work with others, not a lot of stress. If you need a quick job I would recommend Wal-mart!"
good,"SERVICIOS ADMINISTRATIVOS WALMART S DE R L DE C V es una empresa incluyente, en la que el respeto por el individuo, la búsqueda de la excelencia y el servicio al cliente son la base de su cultura, en la que se respira un ambiente laboral armonioso en la que se tiene la libertad de tomar decisiones, y da muchas posibilidades de crecimiento, sin embargo esto conlleva a que algunas situaciones laborales no se les de seguimiento a fondo, si no que son ejecutadas de manera inmediata y sin revocacion."
good,I work at night so my review is specifically about night shift. Last year there used to be more people work at night but now they transferred most of the associates to day and afternoon shift. The company still order equivalent amount of merchandise but there are less people that work at night.
good,"Walmart provided great opportunity and growth with the company. I was able to move up the ranks to an Assistant Manager. However, the scheduling was inconsistent. I would recommend that anyone who takes a position at Walmart captures the opportunity provided and not overlook it."
good,Amazing place to work when it comes to benefits and availability. They are willing to work around your life. Management needs a lot of work. 10% discount was nice. They have an amazing open door policy.
good,"Good working place and good benefits once hired on fully, good management, a typical day was fun and busy. Lots of foot traffic while operating forklifts, safety is a number one priority."
good,Walmart is a good place to work.  Good customer service is very important to the Walmart culture.  I assisted customers within my department as well as throughout the store.  I stocked supplies and set up displays. Ordered and inventoried supplies for the department and priced merchandise. Oversaw a small crew and directed work tasks.  I enjoyed interacting with the many different customers on a daily basis.
good,It's an alright place to work. You can get plenty of hours depending on the time of year. The pay is good if you're getting your hours. A lot of positions
good,"I liked working there. It paid well, considering I live in a terrible part of the country... jobs are not prevalent. Having said that, its Walmart. They could pay more.. they are the most profitable corporation EVER. But they don't, its not a bad place to work though. They give breaks, and insurance, and raises"
good,"people who worked there seemed not to smile very much,management needs better customer service skills,walmart is a .fun place to work,id recomend it.number 1 retailer in the world,you work long hours,but its worth it"
good,Walmart is big work loads and constintly changing hours. Walmart has good health insurance for Full Time employees and encourages advancement in the company. Employees must be flexible for scheduling and able to work well as a team and with changes as they occure.
good,"I've worked for the company over 3 years and it has been a journey. Glad I had the opportunity to work with a good team from cashier's, customer service associates, money center service associates, and some management."
good,"I haveworked at walmart for 10 years. I really enjoyed "
good,"Empresa da oportunidade para crescimento, dependendo do cargo os salários são bastante atraentes, nível de cobrança é de acordo com o cargo."
good,Buenos beneficios y buen ambiente de trabajo aunque la gerencia nunca está de acuerdo
good,"I worked cash and sometimes helped on the floor. Worked in the clothes department sometimes, other times helped with displays. Worked during Christmas season when I was in high school. My first job. Paid student wage. Very busy time and customers get very restless sometimes. Working as a cashier was a pretty good job and pretty easy."
good,The job wasn't that bad. Easy work. But as a seasonal employee they can let you go after the holiday is done. No benefits unless you stay 1 year. Or are made full time.
good,"Its never a dull place to work .Our customers at 2859  have been complaining that I'm leaving but I've been training our associates to follow my lead in in customer service - ""Treat everyone like family but not as bad""...so I know our customers are getting the best."
good,"Loved having many responsibilities, staying busy, dealing with so many different types if customers. Friendly coworkers, management was very accommodating."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you want to move up but can't afford to go to school. The benefits offered are exceptional, and scheduling is flexible."
good,Walmart is a very interesting and entertaining place to work. They have a wide arranged of jobs to do in the backroom alone. they also have a T.V. in the breakroom.
good,"It was a great place to work for in the 3 years that I was there, until I got injured. Then my attendance was excused properly for when they changed my shifts."
good,It is a nice place to learn and grow. They will train you and you get loads to customer server experience. You and your co workers have a honest change to grow as a team together.
good,"A great place tyo work aty and lots of fun and lots of help pay on time and boss always there to help and always happy and outgoing and love other people ,. a great place to work at."
good,Walmart was something you learn each day and to tell i learn alot from them. The good thing about it was the benefits and the coworkers. the hardest part was the managers. Each day you are assign a different task but you do learn each day though.
good,"The work is typically simple in electronics, the most demanding times are the holiday season when just about everyday is a busy day between mid-November through the first week of January. Management is nice, appreciative, and know every associate as long as you take the time to talk with them."
good,Customers and associates that your build relationships with. Wal-Mart is a demanding job due to customer demand. Must have a great work ethic inorder to be successful at the job.
good,Great  experience good atmosphere great people okay customers learn barcode and how  to use handheld devices stock merchandise great  customer service
good,"The average workday is heavily customer service focused. The other staffing are helpful and management is mostly friendly. The pay is good for the type of work, and opportunities for advancement are plentiful if you only seek them."
good,"The work is not too difficult, and you work with great people. The managers are helpful when you need them to be, and most of them are knowledgeable.."
good,Management doesn't seem to care or show a willingness to understand their associate's personal life outside of work. Hours are not flexible. Unfair to its employees
good,"I enjoyed being a greeter, although I don't think I was liked very well by my manager.  The job still kept a smile on my face, because I enjoyed greeting people."
good,Good management team. Be prepare to wear comfortable shoes. Have a lot of patience for the public is challenging. Very hard work and requires good quality of customer service.
good,"Wal-Mart's a good place to work all safety rules in effect. Easy job but hard working I love it though to be able to work and get through the day,I've picked and packed their but I enjoyed the picking more because you're able to move none stop the whole time until break but its easy work using the rf scanner."
good,Work as part of a fast backroom team. Maintain a clean working area. Place items on the sales floor. Move merchandise using proper equipment. Work independently.
good,I loved it at Walmart. The only downfall at the time was I was part time and they cut everyone's hours. I couldn't afford to get my hours cut so I had to look for a different job. It was a great job. I even liked the manament. All nice
good,"Wal-Mart is a good corporation, they help their associates achieved the goals they want too. They always make sure you have hours, they pay well, the people are friendly."
good,As a high school kid I need to have a good amount of money to do the things I like to do. At first I was getting plenty of hours as well as $10/hr. They have recently cut my hours and that is why I am looking to leave the company
good,"Was a cashier. My hours were crazy and all over the place but my checks were decent. I liked gettin 15 min breaks every 2 hours. It gave you time to smoke, get something to drink, bathroom break etc etc"
good,It really matters where you work and what Walmart you pick to work yet some Walmart's have crime and theft and a lot of other things that go with the job and others have great workflow
good,Walmart is an OK place to work. The coworkers there were more organized and had everything in order. They treat their customers with respect and courtesy.
good,"I enjoyed working here. Fun place to work, always busy, nice customer then there were mean ones, always learned new things. Dealing with difficult tasks."
good,Answer phone | take customer orders | assist customers with questions | operate cash register and Balance Cash drawer daily| assist pharmacist | order products | price merchandise and stock shelves | check in merchandise | Assist with inventory
good,Great place to work with the opportunity to learn and advance.  Management was knowledgeable and worked well with staff on a variety of work development opportunities.
good,Job required teamwork on all levels to complete all of the daily tasks. Most tasks were repetitive and quickly learned and easy to teach to new team members.
good,Es un buen lugar para desarrollarte como profesional tienes posibilidades de crecimiento pero no tienes vida personal.
good,I worked at Walmart for a year. I found that my co-workers were great to be around but the supervisors and managers were not so friendly at times and they took a long time to answer a page from a cashier. Also if you booked time off or had to change your availability they scheduled in on the days you couldn't.
good,I walked about 10-15 miles everyday while loading freight onto a conveyor. It is definitely a grind being on your feet 10-12 hours a day but i've worked at several other warehouses and this is by far the best one to be employed at.
good,Walmart customers are very rude .Walmart over work their employees. People do not know how to respect each other. Some of managers are rude to their employees. They want respect but never give at all. The only reason why its tolerable because the people that you work with are very amazing
good,it is good to work with Walmart. friendly and helpful colleagues. i enjoy to work at Walmart. management considers our feedback seriously. Colleagues are very helpful.
good,"Mostly a good experience, though layoffs are becoming more prevalent. Company does a lot of good. They seem to be losing focus on their bread and butter, which is retail. Seem intent on dominating other markets that aren't particularly necessary."
good,A typical day at Walmart is usually really busy and exhausting. You do get an abundance of customers along with your daily tasks that you need to do for that particular department. They are very good at letting you go on breaks along with lunch if you work more than a 5 hour shift. You can work up to 36 hours part time and 40 full time. It's difficult to become full time. Walmart loves to send you to different departments all the time and get you knowledged up with everything to use you as a tool in the store. All in all like I said its not for everyone it really depends on who you are.
good,The hardest part of this job was working while be constantly understaffed but still having to do the same amount of work as a full crew.  The best part was the physical activity and being able to get into shape without having to go to a gym.
good,"I worked in toy sales, and my routine was the same every day. Walk up and down the aisles and make sure all product was facing forward and that everything was in the correct space. Now and then I had a customer ask me a question, but this did not happen very often. It is super helpful if you know where everything is located in the store instead of just the stuff in your department. People always asked me where to find dish washing soap even though that wasn't my department. Management doesn't always pull their own weight. They can often be found in the back hanging out and making jokes, instead of helping the store associates. You can never find them when you need them."
good,"Hard work will pay off. All roads lead to Bentonville. If you're willing to relocate, you can go far. Management is experienced and will help develop your professional goals."
good,"The culture at Walmart is laid back and friendly."
good,"Working the over-night shift is not an easy job,  once you get used to working hard and fast it can be a nice place to work.  Down side is the over-night shift has the least amount of workers and have to do twice the amount of work.  The more you know how to do in each department, the better your chances to be taken full-time. The best part of the job is meeting new people and making friends.  The downside of the job is, they are so short staffed,  that you are very worn out at the end of the shift."
good,I like to have fun in my environment because the day will go fast and your employees will have fun as well. Making your employees happy means customers.
good,"A empresa Walmart é um bom lugar para se trabalhar  se tu faz a tua parte, você é visto e a possibilidade de crescimento é bem grande, só depende do profissional contratado"
good,productive and good workplace.  Management team needs improvement.   advancement is not fair in the company.  favoritism plays a part in an employee advancing within the company.
good,"I had some fun times, I just want to experience myself in something new. The only thing I don't like here is how I'm getting treated some days now that I have been there almost 5 years."
good,"i loved working at walmart. "
good,The work place as a whole isn't to bad. It's mainly the other employees that ruin it for me and their work ethic. It makes you feel like you do almost everything on your own with no help. Management is pretty good there though so that a bonus.
good,Walmart is a vast corporation where the employees are numbers. Management is driven to meet financial goals by any means necessary. This resulted in poor management / employee relations.
good,It has its ups and downs like most jobs but can rewarding in many ways. Helping customers can be a great experience and you may surprise yourself alot. It's a day by day learning experience​ with new obstacles around every corner. And with being a member of the modular team you get to see a inside look of how things are set up for the customer.
good,Its ok. There are good days and bad with all jobs. Walmart is what you make it. If you want to advance the opportunity is there you just have to work. Also you have to sacrifice a lot of your personal time.
good,"otima empresa, dinamica agradavel, porem com poucas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,There was really no work life balance at Walmart. They will work around your school schedule or another job schedule. But they will still work you to death.
good,"The benefits at Walmart is great but the culture can use improvement. Management likes to make friends with people. Some might not see this as a bad thing but when the associations turn into cronyism, people see a problem."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work. There is not much opportunity for advancement and the pay is low. It is a workplace for young students or the elderly.
good,"I was very happy with Wal-Mart besides management, they are not concerned with their associates, the team work dynamic is not the way it should be. If you're okay working by yourself you'll do just fine. The benefits are great, and if you show initiative moving up in the company shouldn't be a problem"
good,"With competent management, your Walmart store can excel. A busy job where you've always got something to do, the money is just good enough to make it worth it."
good,Walmart was a very good working place. Workers are more like family than anything. At walmart it takes a lot of working together to get jobs complete.
good,"The company is a well rounded place to work. The benefits are good, the people are amazing, the company shares profits with assoicates. The cons are lack of communication and leadership skill, the promotions are to fast without proper training. All in all did like the way things work there and learned a lot about business."
good,"Everyone was a blast to work with, Management was ok, nothing bad, nothing spectacular. Generally will work with you if you give a forward notice on needing days off"
good,Empresa com grande numeros de funcionarios.... atua em todos os setores de compra
good,I worked at the Rushville Indiana walmart. I absolutely loved the people I worked with. Most of upper management is very considerate and will work with you if you have issues with anything.
good,I started off as a store management intern. They really favor college students in their intern program. To advance into higher positions you need to be bold and be really connected with the store manager. At Wal-Mart to advance into higher positions you need to have connections and be a fun and astute person (the qualities of any manager there).
good,Was a cool job they should just be a little more understanding for women who are CSR or Cashiers and are 8 months pregnant. Which can kill your feet and back as we all should know!
good,"Bakery manager--fast paced position. Would have been a great job, had they paid a livable wage and offered the option to have insurance. Lots of work to keep busy."
good,a typical workday at walmart was fast paced. i loved walmarts hours which was 40 hrs a week sometimes more. the managers were ok but i felt lik the store was unorganized
good,Loved what I did as far as working in the auto shop but management was very difficult at times. Dealt with a lot of problems when trying to advance in the store.
good,"This is actually a decent place to work.  It's mostly for self starters, the pay is decent, and the hours are okay.  The only problem was management because they were hare to work with.  But other than that, there aren't that many cons to this company."
good,I think Walmart is a great place to work for those who are starting out and want to make a career with a company that advances it's employees! There is a great atmosphere with co- workers and customers!
good,"Each WalMart is different and different people WalMart is always hiring I would go back in later future  But to a super center WalMart."
good,"Great place to work for, Management seemed a little unorganized. Great pay and decent benefits. Great opportunity for growth, as long as you can work hard."
good,I was trained all over the store which helps with customer service. knowing were places are and knowing some of the product your selling is good to help out. There was lack of communication even with a communication log. Managers did not know I was fully trained in every department they had.
good,The management pretty much is the only downfall of the company. The scheduling was flexible. The advancement in the company was horrible too. Not really any room for growth in the company.
good,"During a typical day at Wal-Mart, I work the top stock to see what can be put on the shelf and then I have to work the freight that is brought out for the aisle I am assigned. When I am done stocking, I have to clean up my cardboard and trash and then go help other people finish their aisle."
good,"I worked overnight in the produce department. I enjoyed it. I would show up and spend the first 2 hours unloading various truck shipments, then I would cashier until 1am, we always had a busy rush of people trying to buy booze before it was too late. Then i would take my lunch break and spend the rest of the my shift throwing away the rotten and old produce and replace it with the new. I also changed around the promotions and prices as needed."
good,It was a good experience and it taught me a lot in assembly. That problem was the crazy hours I will work until 11:30pm and then have to open the next morning at 6:30am.
good,"Plenty of great associates and management. Willing to help kickoff career if you're willing to put in the work. Some problems with associates calling in, have to frequently cover others shifts. All in all, great place to be."
good,great place to work. I loved working at walmart. The customers and co workers were always fun to be around... I would love to get my job back at walmart. I learned a lot there and met a lot of nice people
good,It was a highly competitive and stimulating environment and was a perfect part time job for a student. I was able to develop my time management skills
good,Walmart is a good place to work for with wonderful management. The hardest part of job is lifting heavy objects and the best part is we are one big family.
good,Everyone is set in their ways and doesn't want to promote. So there isn't any room for advancement. It's also hard to join in their group of peers. They don't like new comers
good,Wal Mart was a great experience for me. Hate i had to leave but I moved. I learned so many new things and met so many new people.  The staff and managers were respectful.
good,A workplace where you'll meet lot of people who have different beliefs that sometime will help you to understand them and know them better as a co-worker.
good,Walmart is good place to work. But not good enough to lean and enhance your skill sets. Daily routine work nothing more new and challenging management and coworker are humble and supportive
good,"Una empresa con gran responsabilidad social, mucha cultura empresarial y enfocada a ayudar a la comunidad. El ambiente de trabajo en amigable y la gente es muy cordial. Aprendí la lectura de reportes financieros, manejo de indicadores y reportes de productividad. La parte mas complicada es sobrellevar la vida personal con la vida laboral por los horarios laborales."
good,Wal mart is a Compeny thats has structured itself on the demographics of lower middel class in my opinon. But working from them is alrigt i enjoy my job because of all the differnt pepole.
good,"I loved Walmart.. the customers can be so rude, but that only help you with great customer service. Sometimes your team member could be an problem but its nothing you cant pass."
good,Worked here for about 6 months and the people I worked with were awesome but management sucked. Benefits were really good and so was the pay. For a part time job this would be a good place to start
good,"This is a great place to work if you are trying to gain experience. However, they do not care about your well-being. the pay is great if you get enough hours. they say they work with school schedules, but they did not work with my school schedule at all."
good,The job was fun for the most part. Some parts of the job require some physical labor and can sometimes be repetitive and boring. I loved most the people I worked with.
good,Frendly and family atmosphere. A great kob for college stusents due to the fact that they work with your school schedule. Needs to have medical benifits more widely avalible than you having to average 30 hours to recieve.
good,La tienda es buena sus valores y demas lo malo es que no todos los directores lo llevan a cabo
good,"The company has a large number of employees that come and go in my opinion should be careful to try to retain employees and remove a system of punishment points I find very mechanized and not flexible / also lends itself to persecute employees for one Reason, or other Orient the Latino employee in his / her language that rules follow many techniques many of the employees do not know who signs or why they dismiss him when he does not give a warning. They have no knowledge"
good,"we would have a store meeting every night to set are goals. then down stock and but new stock away. then by the time it we get that done its was time for lunch. after lunch we would zone the store tell ""7"". most day we would get done late because management wont listen to each other."
good,"Walmart is walmart. a great place to work but a busy place. however, if you love people, you will love walmart. However, It was more family oriented while about 20 years ago. Many things have changed as a desire to get more from less."
good,"Since working at Walmart Marketplace I have found it to be an interesting place to work. A typical day for me starts at 1:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. I get on the register assigned to and from then I am interacting with customers. I've learned that people are in general friendly and appreciate the service that you provide especially if you present yourself friendly. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and the hardest part of the job is management. Overall, working at Walmart Marketplace has been a positive experience for me."
good,"A typical day consists of coming in and finding out what needed to be done, like freight, sweeping, or zoning. You learn how to help customers every day. Management is fine, when they want to help.Our workplace culture is to always help the customer, to smile, look them in the eyes, and greet them. The hardest part of the job would be helping the customers, but the most enjoyable part is getting the customer the help they need."
good,"There was an overall calm and professional atmosphere at this employer. But the time off policy and the way they did things when it came to ""sonority"" were to me definitely needing serious work."
good,"I was a cashier there, I loved working there due to all the different type of people you would meet in a daily basis but also it sucked when you would have those days were you wouldn't stop. Specially on Sunday's or the beginnings of the month. Overall it was a cool job, just the hours and payed sucked."
good,"Monroe Wal-Mart supercenter was an amazing store when I started in 2011, there was so much to learn and so many people to show me how and what to do. The department managers are extremely proud of the work they do and are always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,Love being able to work with different people on a daily basis. Co-workers were an awesome group of people. Wish the pay was better and had room for growth.
good,It's fun working for walmart.  The customers can be very rude at times but it is important to be even nicer to them because it will make them feel bad about being mean.
good,"Great place to work as a permanent associate, but not as a temporary associate.  There are no benefits until you have worked with the company for a year to an exception of the discount card."
good,I worked at Walmart for over a little three years and learnt a lot. I was a cashier for two of them and i used to be the customer service representative for the other year.
good,Muito aprendizado  várias oportunidades de conhecimentos
good,Working at Walmart was a tough place an also a good place at times. I met a lot of wonderful co workers and customers. Sometimes people will have their days but it was a cool job at times.
good,"A typical day is being stressed but enjoying the job. I learned so much while working at Walmart, I learned how to cashier and how to work customer service. Management wasn't their best thing. The hardest part about the job was the hours I was working and not being able to lower them without being demoted. The most enjoyable part of the job was working customer service."
good,You have to learn the process and time frames first. Stay busy. Always come to work on time and ready to work. Most of management is young and may be hard to work with.
good,was not bad when i was there liked it overall management was not too bad met a lot of good people and made some new friends while i was there breaks are nice and the job was not to bad at times
good,Nice place great people but management doesn't look out for the good employees. Good benefits after 1 year with the company. Great place for someone just out of highschool looking for their first job.
good,Walmart is a great place to work everybody is people friendly and you learn something new everyday just seeing the smile on my customers face while there walking out the door lets me know i did my job
good,"They worked with my college schedule mostly, I feel it is time for me to venture for a new opportunity to make better money but I am fortunate to have been employed."
good,Customer is number one. Team work and respect to other team members always make the work easy. I liked the way the management was a good example and the way they used to motivate us.
good,Showed up to work and did everything possible to ensure customer satisfaction. Management did recognize my commitment to excellence and provided me opportunities for growth and position upgrades with more pay included.
good,"Me gusta el trabajo en equipo,tanto como la amabilidad con mis companeros de trabajo."
good,Great work experience in which I had many opportunities to better my customer service skills. I learned how to work under pressure in a busy work environment especially during the holidays.
good,"good work place,  good management, good people to work with and work for, positive experience to date, enjoyable atmosphere, leastr stressful job I've had to date."
good,"A good place to work and make great new friends. Helpful managers to assist in ways to make things easier. Flexible Department leads that go beyond the job to assist those in need. Stress levels can get high around holidays, but are usually balanced out by more hired hands to assist in customer requests. Learning new skills almost every day is a bonus to employment."
good,The morning meetings are fun. The work loads are huge and there isn't enough support to get it all done. There are always fun events for the employees hosted by the management team. The schedules are not easily changed but the direct manager can usually make changes for associates.
good,"working for Walmart is for work life for single people who don't go out. I would say. The pay is worth some of the problems you go through. Management can get a little difficult to work with but you have to stand firm and be persistent. Walmart in general is a hectic, multi tasking , headache of a job. There are always pros and cons to working any job and meeting new people or having regular customers is always a joy to me. I would say not being able to set your own schedule would be problem for most. If you consider working for a Walmart company my advice to deal with customers is to smile, through the good and bad and tell them to have a PEACHY day."
good,"This company has been good to me as a company and the benefits are good and affordable. Also, you get to know a lot of the high profile managers during your time working here and most of them are really reachable and easy to talk people."
good,I like my job. night is a better shift to work in Walmart. I like the managers on over night they make your job much easer to do. costumers at Walmart they treat you great.
good,"Es una empresa muy grande, existe un buen ambiente laboral, tienen buenos horarios para estudiantes auque el sueldo es bajo."
good,"Walmart va adelante del resto de los Retails en cuanto a procesos, tecnologías e implementaciones."
good,Walmart was ok but weren't flexable and definately not understanding of job positions they put  managers in areas they had no clue about.  Managers wanted employees to do unethical things that would look bad on my report if we're investigated.
good,Walmart was a good job for sure. Loved everyone I worked with and the pay was good. However certain things could change. Mainly flexibility with hours or benefits for people working part time. But all in all I liked walmart. The people are good there.
good,"Customers were the most enjoyable, making their experience easier. Handled all of their financial needs efficiently. the hours were not outrageous. Good benefits."
good,walmart was very high energy and fast paste job. There was tons of wonderful costumer that came in and made time fly. Employees were upbeat and pleasant to be around
good,Its a typical cashier job. Have to deal with large amount of work in the afternoon and evening. Management is mostly understanding and friendly in the store i used to work. Regular breaks are given
good,"Electronic sales representatives are the retail salespersons who sell electronic equipment to consumers. They assist customers in finding what they need, and they can help increase a store's sales by providing information about products to customers. A high school diploma or GED is usually needed, and on-the-job training is typically necessary. Various skills and abilities are also needed, such as those in communication, math, sales and customer service. Previous retail experience is also required."
good,Walmart workers are usually told their tasks for the day at the beginning of the shift and must achieve the tasks while helping customers. Hence multi tasking is required. The environment is fun and friendly depending on the department you work in.
good,"Trabalho sem rotina, exige saber lidar com pressão. Gerência tende a ser flexível."
good,The hours are not set but its is a great place to work.  The pay is very competitive with other employers with benefits for both full time and part time people.
good,I worked for Walmart in the early 2000s. When the old  culture that made Walmart great was still going strong. Was not the same when I left in 2009. Not the same company anymore as they don't take care of people like they used to
good,management and store need work. but they have no problem giving you the hours. overnights is quit. a lot of moving and lifting. Everyone for the most part is nice and get along.
good,"My day is usually pretty smooth. There is a good balance of new customers to recurring customers, and most of them are quite friendly. You get a break every two hours, as well as an hour lunch. Management is nice and helpful, as well."
good,"Walmart has great benefits and opportunity for advancement can occur at short notice. Also, the management are very respectful and understanding that their employees are valuable and appreciate them."
good,"I loved working at walmart. The overnight remod job was a blast, got me outside, moving around, doing a variety of tasks, came with good break times and a nice schedule. "
good,"No floor help, no communication, management doesn't back you up, obnoxious customers. Good benefits if you work there more than a year to qualify, quarterly bonus' are a big help. Paid time off. Sick time. Not enough hours."
good,"Worked fast and had fun. no time to be bored here. Nice, go in and do your job and go home. Most of the staff keeps to themselves including management. Quiet environment."
good,"It was a fun place to experience new people, and learn new job duties, some days working with customer's was a very hard task, but I use my charisma to get me through the day.  The management was cool, but sometimes were lazy and occupied with things other than what was important at the time.  I love coming to work the city was great, and we would always have fun food days on friday."
good,"Ridiculous attendance policy. Shifts run over when store understaffed. Do your work and limit personal relationships, managers frown down on any socialization"
good,"a normal day was busy helping customers and cleaning the deli department. I learned the value of hard work and to work on a fast pace. the management was poor, the employees made most days enjoyable. the hardest would have to be the two hours we had to clean everything in Deli and most times it would be only two of us. The pay was the only good thing."
good,Great place to work just in a small town where every one was related expressed this to management only to have them tell me that i should break protocol and catch however i wanted to even if i got hurt
good,"Advancement opportunities, developing skills, grow your resume, or grow with the company. They're really flexible, they do their best to work with you"
good,"nice place to work at mangement need to improve. walmart gives bonues on regular, but your hours could also get cut. the company is not bad just need to improve commuination skills."
good,"En general es un buen trabajo, te apoyan si es que lo necesitas, aunque lo único malo es que es demasiado tiempo y puede llegar a absorberte un poco, la paga no es mala, lo único malo es que es complicado crecer; ya que los que llevan mas tiempo no te dejan aunque tengas las capacidades para subir"
good,There's no effort from any staff members at all from the time I've been worked there. It was a great place to work at but it just wasn't for me. Very slack working environment.
good,This Walmart location is very slow and you often find yourself having to search for something to do when not assisting a customer. The hardest part and just staying motivated and busy when its a very slow shift.
good,"Eu fazia visitas diárias as lojas Extra e Wal Mart . Fazia controle de produtos com defeito em estoque destas lojas . Controle de presença e de produção dos nossos funcionários . Produzia relatórios com informações retiradas das lojas , seus gerentes e responsáveis . Fazia atendimento aos clientes finais destas lojas / consumidor final. desenvolvia métodos de melhorias nas nossas atividades  ."
good,"We talk the customers to see what they need in a phone and make suggestions. We give customers information about the different carriers that we have to help them make a decisions on what they want. We activate (Set-Up ) Cell phones for various carriers such as At&T, Straight Talk, Verizon, Family Mobile, TracFone, Virgin Mobile and Total Wireless( both prepaid and contract phones). We Stock phones and electronics merchandise. We also audit our inventory daily. We do some troubleshooting when a customer comes in with a phone issues.We try to help the our customer feel at ease especially with customers that know little about technology.We learn something everyday. I enjoy when a customer says thank you for explaining that to me now I understand."
good,Would still be willing to work with them again. Just need to have one close enough to where I live.  Enjoyed the variety of music that played during my shift.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, compañerismo, cumplir con sus objetivos y metas!!"
good,"Good place to work. Competitive wages. Good experience in retail. Friendly coworkers. Flexible hours. Opportunity to work in other deptartments, such as the photo lab."
good,"I have been working for Walmart for a little over 3 years now, I don't mind the work as a cashier but I'm not getting enough hours to support my family."
good,working loss prevention and saving the company thousands of dollars I asked for a raise in pay  making  an hour and paying for benefits and working all kinds of  hours you would think they would give me  nope they gave me cents an on a dollar
good,If it would have been organized better production would have been much higher.  Constant relocation of work areas leaves for postional delays and down time. Better planning and foresight would aleviate these issues.
good,"Contiene mucha estabilidad laboral pero llega el momento en que no creces, y debes de avanzar a aprender nuevas actividades, nuevos retos."
good,Applying retail knowledge to enhance sales. Learned how to strategically place products to increase sales for company. Management helpful to make there job easier or to better themselves but critical. Interacting with customers and making their shopping experience an enjoyable one.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. I learned a lot of current warehouse management systems. Management is very efficient, this is a great place to make your career."
good,"A typical day was 8 hrs. We started by unloading a shipping truck for the first 2-4 hours.  Afterwords, we would go on the sales floor and stock until 8 pm. Then we would take out the new inventory that came off of the truck for the overnight crew."
good,The pay was very minimal for the amount of work and physical requirement. There was not much training but the atmosphere was pleasant. The management worked well with employees.
good,Its a fast paced environment..you need to know how to multi-task.  Management team is good but need to take a little more interest in their associates. Hardest part of my job is working in the freezers.
good,typical day at Walmart is very fast paced but i learned a lot as far as moving around and getting things done. There is always opportunity to move up and get higher pay.
good,I learn to be  patient  and fix problems  without  consulting  higher management I'm a team player  that  handle my job very serious  I have a hard time dealing  with  dishonest people
good,Preventative maintenance for all makes and models of vehicles. oil changes to tire rotation and balancing. learned a lot and grew a love for working on motor vehicles.
good,"I love working here. My coworkers were so much fun to be around. No matter the age, they welcomed everyone with open arms and positive words of encouragement and were always willing to help the new people."
good,"I worked in the baby dept, put stock out daily, helped on the register and unloaded freight. I also worked the fitting room and answered the  phones. We did not see management much. hardest was dealing with cranky customers, my work crew was most enjoyable."
good,Walmart gave me over 10 years of professional experience in my field of business. The environment is friendly and fun. They have onsite training facilities and a nice cafe.
good,The companys are okay to work for some are better than others.Attendance is strict at one because they dont even accept dr notes you take a hit on your attendance even if your sick cuz you dont show up for work
good,"WalMart provides a good salary for an entry level job. It can be a good place to work depending on the department you work in and what you are looking for in a job. The people that one works with are usually good, hard-working people, and they work together well as a team."
good,I love working at Walmart. They have always worked with me to learn new things and to push myself to do my best. Being a mother of 5 children I often miss out
good,They make you do more than what they pay you for. There are only a select few of managers who are actually good. Hardest part would be not choosing your own hours.
good,"Established or identified prices of good services or admission and tabulated bills using calculators, registers and price scanners. Received and processed payments, and issued receipts, refunds, credits and change to customers. Packed and unpacked items to be stocked on shelves. Stored items in an orderly and accessible manner on the sales floor. Answered 6-line phone and transferred calls to appropriate department."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, bom relacionamento com colegas e gerência. Parte díficil referente a horário (finais de semana e noite)"
good,"Normal routine workplace, assisting customers finding inventory items. Learned to multi-task and balance several requests simultaneously. Upper management and immediate management is always on floor ready to assist."
good,"I loved Walmart; however, the hours are extremely long and too much for a college student. There was times when I had work to do, but my managers would not give me my requested days off."
good,"Working for Walmart you never know what you are going to get every day when you show up for work. Some days were nice and laid back felt good to show up work, but then there were those days where we were doing almost everything. Amount of work is not worth the pay."
good,"It's very fast paced work, it is a retail store so that is expected. You tend to learn a lot because you are dealing with  customers almost all the time and that benefits your communication skills.  There are many opportunities to polish your leadership skills too."
good,It's a productive work place with great employees and management that are working together to get the job done and help the customer. It is a great place for a first job and maybe even moving up the ladder.
good,"I know Walmart gets a lot of bad rep, but I honestly loved my job working here. It was definitely my co-workers that made me stay here as long as I did, and was definitely the reason it was so hard to leave. Since leaving they have increased employee minimum wage, which would have been nice while I was there, because the job could be quite demanding and many days I felt it wasn't worth the miniscule pay."
good,"Good company to work for and very supportive of work/life balance. "
good,"There was no such thing as a typical day working in retail. The basic job functions were the same, however, each customer encounter is somewhat different. I learned patience, multi-tasking, to develop my inter-personal skills with customers and fellow associates."
good,"Walmart was a great experience for me.  I would work their any given day if offered a Full time position,  I will be applying again."
good,For the most part it was a fun and productive place to work. Again got to meet lots of different people from all diversities. Liked the customer servicepaet of the job the most!
good,High paced and busy environment. Lots of work with the public. Definite open potential for advancement and job choices abundant. All inclusive job with all walks of life.
good,most of your coworkers are fun and easy going very hard to get a day off though if you need it or even switch days management is ok they basically try to avoid you as you do them
good,"The best job I've had so far. You build a family working there not just making causal friends. I love my CSM's, and and the opportunities Wal-Mart offers."
good,"Normal retail job, go to work and leave. Advancement can happen, but it tends to get worse as you advance. Realistic duties would be nice if you want things done correctly."
good,"I loved working in the garden center working around the plants."
good,Everybody had something to do. We all helped one another with assignments. There was nothing hard about the job. Management should listen more to their employees because they are the ones working in their departments.
good,"It was a good place to work as far as retail goes. Management is great, they have great communication between themselves and the employees. The is benifits have gone done hill over the last five years but all in all it was a good job."
good,I enjoyed my company here at Walmart. I loved the people I worked with. There's always a laugh in the middle of work and I'll never forget all of those memories. I learned a lot from this job: from English speaking fluency to  what it takes to overcome obstacles.
good,"Love working at walmart surrounding with great people. However, not a job for life, can't make enough for living. "
good,A typical day was running register to check out customer. I gained experience is working with management and customers. When we had downtime we would zone the areas close to the registers.
good,You had to stay productive in your work from the time that you started to the time that you finished. At Walmart you have a time limit to get stuff done and I always met those goals.
good,Always around customers. Always something to do. Easy to find things to do when on down time. Always able to ask for help when you aren't quite sure what to do.
good,I was lucky to have a position doing meaningful work. My work was flexible and I worked with really great people who cared about our associates.
good,"Typical day at work involves taking care of all patients needs, ensuring associates are exceeding our patients expectation."
good,"Walmart is a very busy place and you have to be quick and efficient as well as friendly to insure the best customer service experience. A good place for young and old, experienced and inexperienced, to work together to make sure the customers needs are filled. This means managing your time between rushes to tidy your station, or make sure you get back from break on time. Another point to make is making sure you are friendly to the customer, but not in a way that  keeps other customers waiting."
good,"A typical day at work includes helping the customers and keeping the sales floor clear of any items that have fallen as well as keeping the isles of the departments zoned. My job is to help customers in fabrics such as cutting fabric and also to help people in the arts and crafts department. I have seen a good progress on my social skills. The management are friendly. The people at work are full of mostly  mature associates, there are associates that are in  High School that can be immature at times. There really is not a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with associates that friendly and helpful."
good,"Loved my position as cashier, my co-workers really tried to accommodate the customers. Really had fun with the customers .  I really,really, really love people!"
good,It is hard to make difference in that company unless personally you know somebody high up. I do like that they invested in different training classes for their employees.
good,Busy but great environment. Depending on your locating and job title salary is different. Walmart is friendly and you can find everything under one roof.
good,Great place to work. great friends to make while working. nice benefits. Managers are always willing to help and lend a hand when there is a problem. They are always there to listen
good,"Going there and packing up fresh bread and closing up. I learned that no matter how much you pack it never ends, keeping up and I loved my job for the most part."
good,"there were good days and bad days . I liked when we were busy, I dont like to stand around with nothing to do. Things could be a bit better there but all in all I enjoyed my job and it has good pay"
good,"So a typical day starts with checking my e-mails and follow up as needed, next would check associates training which is due or past due then check schedules to see who is working that particular day and find them and remind them of their training.  Check with management to see what positions we will be hiring for search through active applicants choose the best candidates and start calling to set up interviews after interview set up job offers for selected applicants and help with job offers, submit background checks and as background checks comes back clear, I begin the orientation process for new associates.  This job has taught me a lot about organizing and office skills needed to succeed and to grow with Wal Mart or expand into a new job.  I work very well with my management team they are fair my current situation is no ones fault they just want me to extend my hours to 40 in addition work 2 late shifts weekly 12pm-9pm Tuesdays and Fridays which would be fine except that I have 3 teenagers that need me also so not able to except full time at this time, but truly love my job and working with all the new associates!  The hardest part of my job is trying to get the associates to understand that training is an important part of their job and that no matter how busy they are they have to fit their training into their day.  The greatest part of my job is meeting all the new associates and knowing I am their first impression of the store and have to be a good first impression and having a good relationship with all new associates and making sure they are comfortable when working"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if your going to school, because they will work around your schedule. They give you an opportunity to move up in the company."
good,"Stock shelves"
good,Fun place to work for at times challenging. Typical day would consist on the amount of freight we get in and how to deal with with the number of workers we have. Put them in a position where we get the most productivity.
good,"Management tries their best to keep order and maintain code. I give credit where credits due. But they don't get credit because, the job is really lacking in spirit and marole. Overall the work is easy."
good,"Challenging, must have good people skills, organizational skills, excellent customer service skills. Good open door policy. Community oriented company."
good,A great learning experience  fine tuned customer service skills  gained job positions pretty rapidly.   A great asset to the community with jobs and contributions
good,An extremely supportive and positive workplace and atmosphere. Management was cooperative and effective with workers to ensure good results. Hardest part of the job is cleaning the store. Best part of the job is employee interaction.
good,"walmart is a nice place to work at, it has some issues with management but overall is a good company, very low wages though!"
good,"Responsible for entire parking lot activities; including carriage returns, assisting customers with merchandise/products, maintaining a clean and organized parking lot, all customer support as needed."
good,"At Wal-Mart, it is a family based environment. They want everyone to feel comfortable and to be able to walk around and find the items they need. With the help of worker located throughout the store, it helps to lower the stress of customers who cannot find items they may need. The resources available and standards that Wal-Mart sets, are the standards that I have set for my following occupations as well. In smaller businesses, such as fast food, there tends to be hazards that are frequently ignored, and unfair treatment between all staff and workers. Wal-Mart, was work oriented and customer based."
good,"Management was challenging to deal with at times, but if you are willing to communicate and be relentless in what you need them to do for you, you can get somewhere with them.  The employees are very transient- I worked there for two years and there was only 1 person that I worked with the entire time.  I learned a lot about advocating for myself, as scheduling as a high school student can sometimes be difficult, but most of the managers were willing to work with me.  I also learned a lot about collaboration and customer service.  Overall it was a rewarding first job."
good,i loved working in the pharmacy as a cashier.. I learned a great deal about meds and how they worked as well as answer phones and put away stock
good,great people good hours and pay but management was  not very good. people run around crazy and not very professional. I believe the workers where over looked and over worked.
good,What I learned at Walmart was how to work together as a team. I also learned how to drain oil from many different types of vehicles.
good,"I learned a lot of essentials about the Walmart corporation. "
good,I enjoy working with the people and learning all that I have learned. It is a very productive environment. The manager's are very helpful and the best HR department.
good,"- En mi vida personal hasta el momento solo 1 ocasión he sido molestado y solo para atender algo muy importante "
good,You can grow at Walmart.  Choose HO opportunities and the sky is the limit. Store opportunities provide a springboard to corporate jobs. The culture of the organization is steeped in history and strives to do its best by associates.
good,"A typical day consist of stocking shelves, helping customers find things, mixing paint, printing hunting/fishing licenses, putting returns away and running a cash register. I main thing I've learned has been customer service and how you have to deal with different people differently."
good,"Ours is a fast paced environment where we balance results with relationships with the common goal of giving our customers the right product at the right price.  We do not compromise our values of integrity, excellence, service, or respect as we maximize our value to all stakeholders.  The challenge is always to simultaneously meet day to day goals while designing the next generation of supply chain."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart it was a very great learning experience customer is a great catergoty for me always smiling and being happy
good,"a hardworking and reasonably enjoyable workplace, a medium to large workload on a typical day, management has its pros and cons but mostly lie in the pro, the culture is diverse and enjoyable, the hardest part of the job is receiving and unloading trucks because of the varying sizes of the trailers, in my opinion there is no real enjoyable part of my job"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral empresarial, donde se aprende considerablemente, sin embargo las jornadas laborales son muy extensas."
good,"Walmart is basically what you make it. Since working there i have learned that the best thing to do is to keep to yourself and do your work, noone will mess with you."
good,"It is a fast-paced environment with a lot of moving parts.  The customers really appreciate good customer service.  The company does reward hard work and has a lot of employee appreciation activities like free donuts on Fridays, frequent cook outs for the employees and additional employee discounts for working Black Friday."
good,Walmart is great. Once you get to the benifits. You do not get any discount until 3 months in. You will constantly get yelled at by coustomers but no matter what happens the management is usually always understandable to the situation. They are willing to work with your hours. The only thing is if you are sick or the roads are so bad that it is highly dangerous for you to drive you only get four times to call out within a six-month period. That is very hard when everyone is sick during the winter and when it is always snowing. More than likely it will always be held against you if you call out for any of those reasons or even if you have a family member that is in need of you being there.
good,I loved working here and i would recommend to anyone looking for good hours and part time work or looking for something fto accompany school hours.
good,"A typical day at work is going to the back room the scan and cap my bins. This means i go in the back and see what merchandise needs to be on the floor. After doing that i check the Mc40 for price changes and go on with that. After i am finished i stock my bins with anything that couldn't fit on the floor when i capped them. After my tasks are done for the day i go to management and ask them if they need any more assistance with anything else. I help out with almost every job. I did cashiering, customer service, cart pushing, hard ware, auto motives, and electronics. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping  customers who couldn't find what they were looking for and the look on their faces when they finally got the help."
good,"Aprende uno muchas cosas, es como una escuela y eso es bueno."
good,"Te forjan un espíritu de trabajo en equipo, el personal es muy agradable, ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, demasiada competencia, motivación en general."
good,A day at work is having customers come up to me and smiling because i took care of them and made sure their orders were right. I learned others get mad when they see other people like you more. The manager had favorites and I was not her favorite. The hardest part was trying to work and have my boss tell me i was doing it wrong. I enjoyed the people that liked me and i enjoyed going home after.
good,"Tive a oportunidade de desenvolver as minhas competências, habilidades e atitudes profissionais, sendo orientada por um gestor."
good,"Es un lugar que te abre las puertas a un primer empleo."
good,"The best part of working at Walmart was the people I worked with. Though it was at night so most of us weren't particularly energetic, coworkers were helpful to each other and cooperated well in dividing the work. The job was satisfying, as by the end of the shift there was a visible difference in the store according to the enactment of our responsibilities such as cleaning and filling the shelves with merchandise so everything was in order before morning shift came in. The hardest part would be the sleeping schedule this kind of job requires, as it is overnight when most people sleep, which kind of throws off your normal circadian rhythm (the body's natural sleeping patterns)."
good,"This was my First Job in a Retail environment so at this time i didn't know what i was doing majority of the time until i got amazing guidance from one of the managers in a different department. "
good,"What I love the most is customer satisfaction, being able too meet all the customers needs and see their smiling face. When I come to work I view my department as my own business."
good,a lot of projects was the best part of the job and getting them completed. hardest part of the job was not really much because you had simple instructions then after that set goals for yourself and get them done.
good,Management was good. Always for improvement. I as a person enjoyed working with people and management as much as I could. Staff need a little more patience
good,"Good place to work overall, downside is customers and if they are grumpy or not. I met some of the nicest people ever at my store. Met a lot of friends. Discount card is nice, staff is nice, good location mostly."
good,"This job was very fun for me, I really enjoyed baking the in-store fresh products. Stocking the shelves was also a fun experience for me, because i got to design the layout of the front tables."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of going into work and finding out you are understaffed again and have unreasonable job times to meet your quota on work. as well as listening to people complain about the company and how bad it is."
good,"With my time at Walmart I noticed right off the bat that managers tend to step on each others toes. A typical day would begin with my area manager giving me duties and within an hour other assistant managers would assign more tasks outside of my area without the knowledge of my assistant manager. "
good,I enjoyed the experience working with the walmart team. I worked as a truck unloader as well as a night time stocker. Was able to work as a team at times as well as on my own.
good,"Worked at a Distribution Center a very production driven facility everything is by the clock, the rule book is the same at all of them."
good,"Its been 4 yrs now and i learnt a lot from these projects. starting as a fresher now as a experienced guy its been wonderful here. "
good,"Walmart is fast-paced but friendly work environment. I love working as a team member and assisting the customer. Walmart is a nice place to work. I like working in different  areas of the store, such as Customer service and help with merchandise return & assisting with site to store customer  merchandise pick-up."
good,It was hard some days but had to push fast so we could get our tasks done by the end of our workday everyday. We needed to empty out stills everyday rotate food through out bad food claim bad food clean break ice make bales cardboard and plastic which they called me for every time.
good,Told managers  3 times to have that guy touched me and nothing was done about it but most of the employees were friends and I stocked shelfs and cleaned
good,"Management was decent.The job was fun and the customers were great. Not really a hard job, just time consuming sometimes. The worst part is standing on your feet all day."
good,"Unloaded trailers with standup rider forklift."
good,"siempre con trabajo,se aprende a trabajar y a saber trabajar con gente atu cargo,continua comunicacion con la gerencia,buena relacion con los compañeros,la parte dificil del trabajo era el tener lo que ocupaba el cliente al momento,lo mejor de ese trabajo para mi fue todo"
good,Working in an a retail environment is all about perspective. How you choose to engage people will often dictate how your day will go. As with any work site there are things that are done well while opportunities for improvement are certainly present.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. Managers are cool and laid back the associates were cool only problem is they aren't really flexible but there is room for advancement
good,"te vuelves hábil con la presión diaria, el trato al cliente y el manejo de efectivo te hace ser mas responsable y comprometido con el trabajo, te enseñas a dar soluciones rápidas y practicas a problemas que se presenten"
good,Everyone is friendly and welcoming and performs their jobs well. It's not the best paying employer but it is fair for work done.
good,Workplace with uneducated managers with very ignorant attitudes. The management team can't handle pressure and becomes very irate with employees. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers leave with a smile on their face.
good,"Worked 60 hours week"
good,I learned how to do all different types of jobs.  I learned a lot about customer care.The hardest part of the job was working every weekend.  I didn't even do this while I worked in patient care!
good,"Once you take your tests, you're basically on your own as a cashier. They don't tell you much so I'd suggest asking a lot of questions (that's one thing I wish I knew ahead of time.)"
good,Wal-Mart as a workplace environment was open and friendly to its workers.  Offered good benefits and perks even to part-time workers such as myself. One of my better retail experiences.
good,"Walmart is a good place to start for just about any needs. If you want part-time they have it. Full-time they got you. Whether it is something that you only plan on doing for a short period of time or a full fledged career Walmart is the place. Being a cashier was usually an alright job. The absolute most difficult aspect are the customers themselves. Not all the customers, but the ones who are having a bad day. Sometimes it's not easy. One of the best parts are also the customers themselves. When having conversations about something you both enjoy whether it is sports, video games, favorite foods the customers can really make your day memorable."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. While employed with Walmart I had the chance to work in several different departments including electronics, backroom stocking, and even management over a couple different departments."
good,"While I was at Wal-mart, I worked in the Produce department for the first year and a quarter. In that department, I was taught to rotate the fruits and vegetables so that the older ones were at the top while the newer ones were at the bottom, to sell them before they went bad. I did that, however most of the people I've seen in that department don't do that.  We got so much stock that we couldn't sell it fast enough to justify it. Because we couldn't sell anything very fast, a lot of food went bad. Due to these two things, I wrote off a lot of food.  I ended up developing an allergy to mold. While I was in the department, I thought that it was just Riverton's Wal-mart that was having the produce issue, but after leaving Riverton, I have learned that that's not true."
good,Young and energetic then this is the job for you.  If you are older and don't like high school shenanigans then you won't like working here. I have worked there for 8+ years and never had a problem until we changed store managers now suddenly I don't know anything and they know everything. Tired of management lying to you about what's going to happen saying one thing then doing the complete opposite. You are made to feel like you are an idiot or can't think for yourself.
good,Walmart was a god company to work for and if you wanted to learn something different from what you already know they were quick to teach you. I enjoyed learning many different positions and areas of the store and it helped me to become the manager that I am today. You were held accountable for your attendance which is important to me. If you are not at work you cannot perform your job at the rate you should. One thing that I did not like about the company is that they claim to be big on Respect the Individual yet co-workers can treat you horribly and they do nothing about it. Customers can also treat you like garbage and you HAVE to take it. I like to work in an environment where respect is given and taken by coworkers and customers. .
good,Good work environment. Friendly customers and cashiers. Worst part of job is when work is when things are slow. Most enjoyable part of my job is when I am really busy.
good,"There are more pros than cons at walmart for me ive spent the last 6 years learning new things from all the good people who come through and many different job titles from the time i started, there very fair and pretty relaxed on most store policies the work is fun and fast paced but its over before you know it id work there again ."
good,"I was the processor there, so I worked full time, 40 hours per week. Definitely not my favorite place to work, because I'm not a fan of Walmart. Stayed for two months and left because it wasn't for me. My co manger was great, worked with me, gave me the hours and schedule I wanted, but there was another co manager there that was very unpleasant, ultimately made my decision to leave a lot easier."
good,"Both jobs have a really good environment, the people are kind, they have fun and also work hard for the company. When there were people complaints they were always solved and token care of."
good,This Walmart was brand new and the staff didn't have everything in order. Fun but unorganized. TLE was the department and customers were happy with the customer service but not the work being performed on their vehicles by the techs.
good,"Coming in to my work place on time, and ready to do all that is asked of me. Days management does ask me to do other task in the store within a time frame and I can easily make sure that I am getting it done and able to get back to my regular work place."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart Supercenter would include an enjoyable staff of coworker, a love for helping customers, and a great experience for learning new techniques and skills. I learned how to become a better people person, learned to stock correctly in order for all product to sale effectively, learned to use a pallet jack and a forklift. Management, in my opinion, had their pick and chooses on who their favorites were. There were some managers who were excellent however. The workplace culture was very diverse. All of the employees got along with very little to no problems. The hardest part of the job is when management picks several battles with you as if you weren't doing you're job correctly. Also, management adding pressure on you to do someone else job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being around people and learning new experiences."
good,"Turnos laborales estables, rol de turnos, manejo de inventarios y manejo de mercancía por volumen, manejo de montacargas eléctrica, compañeros muy participativos, el sueldo es muy bajo"
good,walmart is a great job specially for people going to school. They work with you anyway possible. Great meeting new people and get to learn many things.
good,"A typical day is made sure you have enough cut cold meats in the cases for that day, that the cases was stock with meats and cheeses.  Kept it clean behind that counter.  Made sure had enough hot food to serve."
good,"I oversee employees, and help customers with any questions. Train employees and verify inventory. Telephone and register skills.  I enjoy working with the public."
good,"It's so exciting working in Walmart every day. It's like home, where you banter. When it's time to go home, I feel like I still need to do more."
good,My first year at walmart i was a cashier and then my second year i moved up to customer service . I build a family there and every enjoyed my energy .
good,"un día típico es llegar acomodar y limpiar y si era fin de mes etiquetar aprendí armar exhibiciones y a construir plano gramas "
good,The work environment in the pharmacy is very demanding and requires intense concentration. The associates are friendly and helpful with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when associates work together as a team to accomplish a goal.
good,"i really liked working there. the hours were awsome the pay wasnt so bad , co-workers were awsome , plus you get pto which is paid time off! who wouldnt like to work here."
good,I really enjoyed working at Wal-Mart before they took away compensation for working on Sundays. I believe they took a step back when they did this and I really wish they would take a step forward and recommission that compensation.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was performing the online shopping duties. Very fulfilling when customers were highly satisfied."
good,The managers were awful and they never helped with anythi NH and hours sucked and after i left my store had to get all new mangers because the store was going under
good,Received some training in most of the departments I worked in. Management always seemed to be there to answer any question or problem that came up. Very good co-workers and enjoyed working with all of them. The hardest part of my job seemed to be unloading trucks of incoming merchandise. But there was always plenty of help.
good,"My team would always immediately greet me or customers to ensure an environment that best suits all. After all, at the end of the day, I have learned that a customer's experience is very important because that determines if they want to come back. My role is important but being a team-player this involves everyone; including management.     I believe putting time aside as my old employment did to set meetings to gather all employees to remind them of the goals and achievements we have brought to push us to continuously improve our service .  My co-workers were not only friendly but helpful and enthusiastic which brightens up the atmosphere."
good,"Everyday will not be your best day.  Somedays you may be in a bad mood, somedays the customers attitudes may be a lot to deal with. What i've learned from that is that the customers are always right, even when they're wrong, and it's your jobs to work with those conditions and handle the job to the best of your ability. So smile!"
good,"With the wide verity of employees that Walmart hires you are sure to find at least one friend. The pay and benefits are good if you live frugally. As for the rest it really depends on store management. "
good,"Great job,good benefits,good manager,great selection on products .Great hair care products and services.the store is over all good. I just need something else."
good,"I didn't mind being a cashier. I checked out customer in the front end in the meanwhile I would give them my best greeting and I would wish them well on their. It's a whole lot better than lifting, loading, stocking shelves."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart.  I was just a cashier, however, I am glad to have had that experience.  I got to work with a lot of great people, and the management I worked under was great."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa pra trabalhar,apesar de ter trabalhado apenas como aprendiz,gostei muito"
good,"I have enjoyed working at Walmart, one of my favorite things is that I feel appreciated. A typical day is helping customers have a good experience and get out as fast as possible. Management does a good job at showing their appreciation. I have nice co-workers that make a usual day enjoyable. The hardest part of my job as a cashier is when it gets really busy and we are under staffed. I have enjoyed working here and would definitely recommend it."
good,Walmart stores are known for their massive size and quantity of items. Overnight stockers are responsible for keeping the store full and able to profit. Stocking several tons of freight each night is difficult but is also easy to get used to. The overnight team follows a clear plan that makes work easier and more enjoyable.
good,There was always something to do. It was a pretty fast pace environment. If there was no customers to wait on we could restock the shelves near the register or they would send us to put up returned items.
good,O cargo de vendedor esta sendo um desafio diário tendo que superar metas e alcançar um bom nível de vendas.
good,change oil and tires for vehicles fast paced and fun at times can be difficult and challenging but the reward of customer satisfaction is worth the challenge great beginner technicians job
good,"Working at the Walmart Home Office, as a designer, I was required to crank out work quickly and efficiently. The design team was held to a high standard. We didn't just have one design head to please, but several high up marketing managers as well. We needed to wow them by coming up with new and inventive designs while still staying on-point to Walmart's brand standards. When we weren't designing, we were out on team building events or in group discussions talking about design trends and inventing new ways to build signing elements to wow not only the marketing managers of Walmart, but also the shoppers, our customers. It was fast-paced, labor-intensive, detail-oriented, and fun. The team always had each other's back and were willing to help one another with workload. Our motto was always ""Work hard, play harder"" and that's exactly what we tried to accomplish every day."
good,Developed pictures for customers. I learned how to work with all the photo printing machines and really multitask by working with the electronics department when they were busy. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was not being able to fix the machines whenever they went down.
good,co-workers where great and awesome and so where the management team. they always tried to do special things for the employees. doing your job is great helping customers find what they need and explaining to them what curtain things do was great. I had to re-stock and made sure things where clean.
good,Work environment was fun but management was very lacking. I rarely saw my supervisor and many workers were left unsupervised and without direction on a daily basis
good,"loved unloading the trucks, and operating palette jacks throughout the back rooms. overall a great work environment, and is definitely would suggest this place to work for young individuals."
good,They did what they could to make sure you had all your work done and you can even bonus with the rest of the store. I did enjoy working for the one in Texas as it was a super store but they didn't lose track of you as a person.
good,"Great staffing, easy to work with management. Learned a significant amount about inventory control process and inventory control systems that are used in large retail locations."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y trato con él empleado. Accesibles con los horarios.
good,"Working At Walmart Is A Great Experience. You Only Get 32 Hours A Week, You Learn A lot In Various Departments in The Store. fast Working Pace. Various Cultures You Encounter Throughout The Day"
good,"This job was a little hard to handle when I first started out due to a lack of training. I was expected to do more than I was taught, but then once my managers realized this, I got the help I needed. This might have just been a fluke for me, I am not positive. Anyway, I have now been trained to do what I need to do and the job has been a lot easier. Most days I am scheduled to work in my area alone, but that is enjoyable in itself. I am more focused on the task at hand and not so distracted. However, I do enjoy when I am working with my coworkers. They are friendly and helpful, always understanding of if I don't know how to do something. Overall, my experience here has been good. I appreciate the respect I am given by all the other workers and managers around me."
good,Resolving customer issues on a daily bases. Every associate has different personalities so I have to be able to effectively interact with each associate and make sure that they stay on key and do their assigned jobs properly. I have to be able to communicate with other Customer Service Manages to make sure we are all on the same page and the work for the day is getting done. The hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy unsatisfied customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the smiles and the customers with positive attitudes.
good,Se puede crecer en la empresa y te ayudan a desarrollo profesional y personal.
good,"coworkers are awesome, fast paced day that goes by fast. the management is horrible to work with. they only want their own opinion and they do not take anyone else into consideration"
good,The people that I worked with were great but the opportunity to advance is slim. Also they are not happy when they have to work around your personal life. They also require you to work for them for a year before you gain any benefits.
good,"I would like to point out I worked night shift so this may not apply to all shifts. Personally, I found them a good company to work for. They expect a certain level of work and pay quite well for it, including benefits should you stay."
good,"The workers are genuinely friend, they go above and beyond for the customers.  Employee morale is always high.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with slackers at times."
good,"I enjoyed working here I made great friends and fond memories with my co-workers. I learned a lot in the jewelry department. From inventory, to stocking to great salesmanship."
good,I was a cashier and occasionally worked at the customer service desk. I learned how to have patience especially dealing with customers at the customer service desk because alot of the problems there are the different type of return policies for certain items. Other than that you learn how to handle difficult customers and cowokers and you can cross train in other departments to gain experience and eventually transfer or get promoted.
good,"Buenos Valores (Cada Mañana antes de iniciar la jornada laboral Junta motivaciónal de 5 min)"
good,The store managers were very easy to get along with and hours were flexible to meet my student needs well. Training was easy to follow and organized.
good,I like Walmart  put change have and will come  been here 12 years and injoy every min of the jop great people  I work for and with  like family  and close friends
good,"I unload the trucks which are 1500-2500 hundred pieces, Or I sort the items that come off the trucks onto skids. After I go stock the items on the skids. At 7pm there are picks that drop I have to go arounds picking them then I go work them. After all the stock is worked I have to bin all the stuff that couldn't go out."
good,Walmart was one of my better jobs that I have had. There's always room to move up in the company. After 3 years in wireless sales i was promoted to customer service manager. Ive learned a lot and plan to take all the knowledge with me where ever I go.
good,"My typical day was good work night. I learned to operate their register's. management was alright. co-workers were great except one, I had a bad experience with that co-worker. The hardest part of the job was waking up. The most enjoyable part of the job was THE JOB, I LOVE THAT JOB!"
good,The job environment is very diverse and positive. The co workers aim to achieve the same goal of a positive day at work.  The hardest part of the day is dealing with irate customers.
good,"I worked as a cashier. On a typical day, you run in to some real nut jobs, but typically your fellow employees and management and friendly, and make working the job worthwhile."
good,Associates care for one each other as there way past do work. We learn to accept who people are and knowing your going to.work with the person why not get to know them and get a postive laugh out it.Walmart is a place non judgemental people were ever is well to help before they give up
good,For me the most enjoyable part of being an optician is seeing someone leave the store happy with their new glasses. I having the knowledge that in some way I've helped them.
good,If you have worked in retail before you know the ups and downs of this job.It can be pretty hectic around the holidays though. Recently there was a change in management at my store
good,"en mi opinion personal tuve que desempeñarme como cajero y reponedor, y en ambos aspectos tuve buen ambiente laboral y compañerismo, pero siempre encontre que para el trabajo que hacia mi sueldo era muy bajo."
good,Walmart has a decent pay its a hectic job and allows room for advancement. There management will work with u they give bonus every quarter if the stores bonuses .they give raises and awards for associates .they have a strict call off policy .
good,It's a fun place to work it's busy busy at all times no matter what time of year it is. Your not going to move up at all if you work nights sad a whole the company is good  if you work nights the day time managers do t even know your name
good,La verdad no esta mal la empresa en casi ningun aspecto pero realmente me interesa ganar mas de lo que podian ofrecerme hay.
good,it is a great company to work for. sometimes it is hard to find balance between daily demands and sanity. stressful when unable to meet production because your sustainability of the job depends of production
good,"It's nice to meet new people on the daily but it's not an ideal job. If you're looking for a job where you can get away with pretty much anything and get over on your managers, It is definitely the place to be."
good,"Es un ambiente donde no se valora el esfuerzo ni se reconoce debidamente, el salario por las labores realizadas es bajo y el trato de los jefes hacia los empleados no es el debido"
good,Pretty much was always busy and even though I had some great co-workers some were very lazy so that put more work on others. Management could have been better with schedules and listening to what people need.
good,In retail its really fast pasted. A typical work day for me is stocking products and helping customers find what their looking for.
good,Walmart provides fast growth within the company. You can start as a cashier and become a store manager within 3-5 years. You can build a network of family and friends at this company. They are always there for you.
good,"You will have one major job to do, but will often have to help customers as much as you can. It can and will get busy throughout the day, which will ensure that you never get bored and always have something to do."
good,Overall a good place to work but not a family friendly workplace for employees. I learn that power in the wrong hands can corrupt a whole workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting great life long friends.
good,Worked there for 2 years ended up getting fired for my ex using my discount card loved the job but the people that worked that the store I worked at mostly werent the easiest to get along with
good,Walmart needs there managers to all be in the same page and communication needs to be improved. It is hard to do your job correctly when you aren't made aware of policy changes
good,This job was particularly a decent one once intended to be in place of a beginners job.  It asked much from the person in order to serve the customer as best as possible.
good,The hardest thing about the job is when a Customer wants to agrue about something and they want to speak to a higher Manager that doesn't back you up.
good,"Uneventful days. Full time employment. Mgt. worked well with employees. Work was physically demanding, helped me to lose weight."
good,"Overall Walmart is a nice place to work. It's a great way to get used to the retail environment, and with hard work you have room to move up through the company. Many different departments helps you learn more skills to help you with other jobs."
good,Empresa con turnos rotativos ... disponibilidad para cambiar turnos en casos especiales.
good,"I actually really enjoyed the cashier work and I was good at it as well, once I built up the leg stamina. While there were a few twits among the higher-ups, for the most part everyone was accommodating and it was a very friendly environment. The facilities were all top-notch as well and the clientele had little problems."
good,I enjoyed checking the customers out.  I moved fast to keep the customer happy instead  of having to wait in line for a long time. I was sad when I left to be a stay at home mom.
good,"very busy, never a dull moment. new challenges every day, always challenging, hardest part learning the tire machine. learned how to treat customers properly"
good,The work is hard but you get 401k and stock options out of the gate. The store manager is one of the best managers I've ever had and the other cashiers a really good people.
good,"I enjoyed it because we stayed busy, I was a stockperson and it was a great feeling to actually be working instead of just working at the cash register."
good,Good job work with you scheduled... Great staff clean work place fast service. just time to move on but great company...love helping people and seeing a smile on there faces.
good,"I loved the management team at Walmart, Oneida, NY. They were nice and tried to help. Most of my co-workers were great but a few were lazy and did not want to help out and be a team player. It was always busy at the store. The hardest part of the job was the lack of team players.  The most enjoyable was the customers and my supervisors."
good,"i liked working for Walmart the only reason i left was for the chance to go out of state which is something i had never done before. The management was mean with a few exceptions, and my co-workers were great."
good,"era un trabajo donde tenias que trabajar bajo presión, pero dentro de lo que cabe lo disfrute mucho, aprendes cosas nuevas y eso es lo mas importante, el trabajo me quedaba muy cerca de mi domicilio, decido la separación cuando nos cambiaron de jefe inmediato, no había una buena comunicación y nos hacia quedar mas tiempo de nuestra jornada de trabajo. ya era muy pesado el ambiente laboral y nunca se presto a una convivencia sana."
good,"They are a pretty good job to work for. They pay is pretty good and the schedule is not that bad u work 4 days off 3 or you work 3 and off 4, but management is a little easier to get along with."
good,I loved working for walmart but target was offering more money. The atmosphere is like family and even on the most stressful days you know you can always rely on eachother.
good,"Overall I liked this company. It had flexible working hours. Nice co-workers. Great management team, and awesome customers."
good,"es una buena empresa ya que ayuda a los estudiantes normalmente el sueldo es muy bajo pero permite a los estudiantes horarios flexibles para que estos estudien y trabajen al mismo tiempo."
good,You have had has some good people to work The keep  switch what you  that's not part of your actual job description but the manager of the store she tries to keep order when she's there
good,I wish the customers were more understanding about the policies but I had very good front end managers. My co-workers felt like family. The hours were hard and my schedule was all over the place but I liked who I worked with. I had regular customers that only shopped on the days I worked. It was fast paced and not a lot of down time which I like in a work environment. I learned to be patient with people and how to deal with stressful situations.
good,"I worked night shift until morning, over all the people I worked with were great and I could relate to a lot of them. The management was hard on us even though we were as efficient as we could be."
good,Always kept busy. i learned lots of different things. Management is very friendly and understanding. Coworkers are great even a year  over since ive worked there they still remember me and my children. i love visiting them. hardest part rude customers. best part the friendly customers and coworkers
good,"Touring the store following up on expectations set for each area, setting deadlines to correct any issues. Meet with management team to discuss area of opportunity within their departments, run report to capture any possible shrink opportunity, lead by teach and train or coaching for improvements hourly associates, Audit hazmat for proper processing following OSHA. Follow up on policies and procedures in receiving and claims file any claims needed to get credit before deadline. The most enjoyable part about my day is communicating  and listening to associates concerns and give them the feed back they are looking for."
good,I used to love going to work other than mgmt I have now I would still love it.  I love he wonderful ppl u meet and get connected to love how u gets sense of belonging there but it all changed some how.
good,"I learned skills of stocking shelves with the appropriate merchandise,  I also learned the skill of assisting the customers-customer service. A typical day would be pushing carts into store for customers coming to shop, and the most enjoyable was the ability to interact  positively with the customers."
good,its a great company to start with.as a person just looking for the job starting pay is great.there really strict on work ethics.
good,I loved working there I got to work in different parts of the store that when I first started there everyone was nice helpful. As the years went on everyone changes with most people do. But when you have other people come in and try to take over your job and try to tell how you do your job then its time to move on mostly since management wont do anything to help you.
good,"Working at Walmart was a fairly enjoyable experience. The work place itself is professional yet laid back; everything is done in a timely manner without the chaotic rush. The managers were very understanding and were willing to work around my school schedule in order to keep me working the same amount of hours. My co-workers were great as well; whenever I needed help I knew I could always ask one of them. The hardest part of the job may have been keeping track of all damaged/stolen goods, while the most enjoyable part was actually being a Walmart employee."
good,"• Accept new prescriptions and refill requests"
good,"Os dia no trabalho era um dos melhores, eu passei por vários setores da empresa então aprendi bastante coisa, a direção era excelente, os  meus colegas era ótimos sempre que eu precisava eles estavam la. Não achei nem uma parte difícil mais a parte mais agradáveis era no Rh."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart in Killeen. Always exciting, great communication with management. If you worked hard, they were always willing to work with you if you wanted to move up or to another department."
good,"This new push by Walmart to pull away from the big box stores is really the most brilliant idea. small stores feel homey! People love to feel needed and welcome. I loved my job, I just pointed out under the new system for attendance. However I still love my hometown market! It's quiet and the product choice is better than the traditional supercenter. So I am happy! The market is a great place to work and shop! I really love helping people!"
good,"Everyone has a job that they are responsible for, you could be opening or closing any department. As time progresses you develop a since of pride knowing that you are responsible for a certain task and that you perform it well. The hardest thing would be when you are unable to provide a service you normally would or if you are unable to calm a dissatisfied customer."
good,"They are very tight on money. If you work over your schedule they are sure to make you take a longer lunch. I don't know why indeed cares about my review, but I have to write more in order to move to the next page. Smh"
good,"A typical workday was simple yet hardworking tasks such as unloading trucks, bringing product out to the floor and organizing the backroom. Due to short staff we would also occasionally stock as well. On the job I learned how manage my time and organize in a careful manner as to not drop or break products. I enjoyed the other employees working there as they were friendly from day 1. The hardest part was trying to complete all of our given tasks within the time frame given the small amount of staff."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. I had to leave because I had 4 grandchildren I was taking care of and I needed to be home when they got off the school bus.
good,"Es una empresa seria con valores y políticas, trabaja en equipo,buen ambiente de trabajo,crecimientos y logros a corto plazo."
good,I enjoyed working there if they had more employees.  I probably would work for them again.  It would be nice it they would change the hours.
good,"Managment wasn't in too of things like they should but overall was a fun work place, the great part was making someone smile everyday that was my goal to make someone have a good experience at Wal-Mart ."
good,I enjoyed working there even though it was short. I enjoyed the hours and coworkers. Hours weren't late was able to leave when I was scheduled off.
good,this job is a great place to work management is understanding and they offer many oppurtunities to advance and excel at every turn of the journey
good,"It wasn't too bad, the days went by pretty fast usually, management was fine, I liked most of my coworkers. The worst part was it was hard to get out of a department if you wanted to switch to somewhere else."
good,Very busy day. Enjoyed working with my coworkers. Learned and did more than my required me to. Liked the opportunity to learn new things every day. Flexible hours to work.
good,Wal-Mart is a well rounded organization creating opportunities and careers to all. they support goals and for the future and are very promising. I love having the experience and contributing to the success of the company.
good,"Walmart isn't as bad to work for as people try to make it. I started off in jewelery, which covers all of softies, and shoes. You also have register responsibilities as well as answering the phones. That being said, you can take your breaks on your own schedule if you work in a specialty department. If you're unlucky and get cashier, then you're at the whims of the csms, which aren't always the best. By the end, management recognizes those who work hard, and attempt to move them up."
good,I enjoyed my time working there and felt like I made a difference in the local community!  Typically wrote my own schedule each week.  They were great at being flexible with what hours I wanted to work each week as long as I got just under 40.
good,I love working with the public as I am a people person. I find it challenging and interesting to find a problem and to solve it. I cashier and deal with situations that come up.Also work with a team of employees.
good,Great job to have and a perfect asmispear .  Stay focus on task at hand . Don't let the job stress you . It will get hard at times so relax . Customer will make you mad .
good,"Lots of learning opportunities, and abilities to move up in management fairly quickly. Able to transfer anywhere in the country and also Sam's Clubs. Learn new policies and procedures."
good,"I loved the employees and costumers I really enjoy working with others. If you do not enjoy working with others this job is not for you. The pay is not that great but it is perfect for those just starting out such as students. Wal-Mart is obviously open 24 hours a day so it is very easy to build a schedule. In my experience management was pretty good about working with you to fit your scheduling needs. I would recommend this job for students, part timers, people seeking a second job, or retired people seeking a job."
good,Overseeing a department can be difficult since you depend on other people to get things done. Overall it was a good experience and I learned a lot about management.
good,Good job to work if you have a busy family and need the day to do your dutys. Hour lunches employees discount card after there months however management needs work
good,"This is a good company to work for.  However, the management hiring process needs a better process For Onboarding The Management Team-Managers should be more in control of their areas."
good,"had a good experience but no advancement, looking for more opportunity but at the time it wasn't available. Just looking for a better situation fit for me"
good,"Ótimo lugar"
good,Erratic hours and split days off make it hard to have family time. Good people to work with and most management members work well together. Moving to other stores when getting promoted is difficult when you have a family to move also.
good,"Walmart is a juggernaut, there are numerous poor reviews already, but it's actually a job that can be very rewarding for those that put in the effort.  Advancement is the best aspect, there are always numerous opportunities and the career path is broken up in such a way that someone could enter as a cashier and work their way up to a salaried position in a matter of years."
good,"Walmart has gotten better over the years. Family first is what comes to mind when working for Walmart. Granted, the pay is acceptable and management has been hard at work whenever it's time to punch in. As an overnight stocker, work is completed at a certain time frame and co-workers are alwasy a joy to be around. The most enjoyable part of the shift is being able to use the term teamwork. We always help each other restock shelves so that we can be ready for customers who come in early in the morning. The hardest part is being able to clean up afterwards. It can be tough especially after customers leave trash behind, however, the job gets done in a orderly and timely fashion."
good,"For someone with hardly any work experience, this isn't a bad place to start. This particular Wal-mart is generally very clean and well organized. I took care of products that customers returned, and it really helped me figure out where to find things I needed! The only downside of this part-time job is that your shift may end pretty late (like at 9:00 pm), which may not be a bad thing if you tend to be a night owl."
good,"I am not new to retail or grocery so it is what I expected especially during the holiday seasons. Some days go by fast and others vary; you also have the good and the bad customers.  Trust I have had my shares of both, but mainly good for this time of year."
good,"Walmart was great, especially not having to work with customers and being in the back being able to talk with people while you worked and work on a line with other people. That was fun. I enjoyed this job a lot and left it to landscape, every manager knew me, I helped everyone and worked really hard. I can't complain at all. "
good,Muy buena empresa para laborar solo que la distancia es importante porque es bastante tiempo en el traslado.
good,Can be very demanding and overwhelming with the over load of work someone has to do.  Management can sometimes over shadow all the hard work that needs to be done in a short amount of time.
good,I liked working at Walmart. Managers and co-workers were nice and helpful. I found it fun. I actually wish I could have stayed there longer.
good,"Management there is kind of weird, they buddy buddy so if a friend of management doesn't like you then the managers wont either"
good,Great work environment however as part time worker other benefits like health care sick pay or holiday pay etc are restricted.
good,"I learned how to open up and engage with customers. I also learned a lot about developing and printing 35mm film. I was taught how to troubleshoot broken machines and furthered my education on current technology, such as using cellphones to upload pictures onto kiosks"
good,"Great company to work for as far as salary and being involved in a macro operation at the micro level.  However, you never have free time when salaried.  Expect multiple phone calls on days off asking for information, schedule changes, or to work that day.  Also expect early morning calls being asked to come in immediately."
good,"Too soon to evaluate as far as I can see the staff and co workers are very helpful and friendly to work with.  Management personnel are very understanding and willing to explain all about the area you are working with.  A typical day at work is smooth and easy, and working with other employees as a team is a great feeling.  I find it hard working there is the constant being on your feet and moving at all times.  The most enjoyable part is being with my co workers and learning all aspects of the departments which make up Walmart."
good,A typical work day was busy and fast. Learned how to work on my communication skills and handling large amount of money. Co- workers were great and very helpful. Management was okay.
good,"Day to day activities are similar to other jobs, people are nice for the most part. "
good,Walmart was a decent place to work. It took a year to be eligible for benefits though. Mine was in a college town so it was nice to be able to work with people my age. They work with your schedule
good,Some days its a good place to work at but the Management is really bad about sending you to another Manager when they dont wanna deal with the issue. They also hire people full time when some other people have been waiting for a extented period of time
good,I typically put out inventory and helped customers find everything they needed. I rang up customer purchases and made customer orders in the jewelry department.
good,"Walmart has a great environment to work in. I came in contact with allot of different people from may different backgrounds. Management was great with assisting employees with any task that needed to be completed.My Walmart experience really instilled in me that GREAT customer service, where ever the location is valuable to a company. Also working with others at Walmart was also a good experience, team work! Not only can I get things accomplished on my own but can give and receive help from my fellow co-workers."
good,It is not the most fun work but it's a good paying job for regular employees. However I was only making ten dollars an hour versus seventeen and I was doing almost the same work. The atmosphere is not the greatest but it is fine. I had great managers and staff that I worked with.
good,"Bom de trabalhar, para primeiro serviço aprendi muitas coisas, era empcotadora fazia varias coisas que não era do meu cargo, aprendi muito aprendi a operar caixa, organizar as partilheiras ."
good,"Customer service mangers were very slow at helping you with errors you could not correct yourself, changing my schedule so I could go to class took longer than it did for anyone else and they weren't very helpful with following my schedule."
good,Work there was always fun and the environment was very happy go lucky everyone had a smile on their face. Management could use to be worked on a little bit but over all good place to work
good,Easy to move up in company if you do your job. The job itself is pretty good and most of the people are friendly. Fairly easy load of work but will work you in many places. So lota of bouncing around.
good,Walmart is a great place to wor.k The people and atmoshere is astonishing can be a bit busy at times but overall wonderful. Company is great to work for always room for growth
good,"A typical day at work involves:"
good,Great environment for new workers but sometimes work can get very stressful. Management is productive but does not use time management effectively.
good,"Be prepared for the rude customers and long lines. Management kind of sucks, back in Feb 2016 when they raised pay, alot of other things changed. One of my biggest problems with Walmart is the new attendance policy."
good,Consistent level of work for a eight hour day. Learned how to operate different machinery in helping perform my task. Management was very helpful in areas of concern when it came to personal issues. C0-workers were okay; but not dependable in helping one out if they needed assistance. Hardest part was moving heavy pallets with old equipment. Enjoyed the quiet working atmosphere of working midnight shifts.
good,"Enjoyed working here, fellow associates were all very nice and friendly, and went out of their way to help the newcomers.  The rate of pay was a little better than some places I've worked"
good,"A lot of advancement opportunities are available, for example, I took the leadership training classes for one week to advance my management skills, and etc."
good,It was a good place to work and learned alot and employees where very helpful was my first job and a good experience. Managers were always willing to show new things and around to assist
good,"Steady work place all the time, thousands of happy, satisfied customers. Great training and work ethnic. Great team work, managers as well as team members"
good,It was somewhat very unorganized because of management at the time I was there . The pint system was a tad bit crazy however I manage to survive after all
good,The management team is the best in this work place; they can be understanding and helpful. The team of workers they have for each section is amazing in their own way.
good,Management was very helpful but other employees tended to complain quite a bit making work tedious at times. Physically demanding a lot of the time. lots of opportunity to advance.
good,"what I learned was the cash registers skills and dept manager skills."
good,"Muito regrada ao ponto de vc ser apenas um robo de maos atadas e mesmo assim dar resultados nao so de vendas mas de arrumacao, validade, quantidade de estoque e muito mais."
good,Pretty nice customers . Staff are pretty harsh and barely pays attention to what they are doing . Bathrooms are rarely clean .
good,Report to work at required time and cash out customers as well as keeping the register assigned clean and the aisle organized.
good,They are a place that is great if you are looking for a reasonable rate pay job. The management is kind of sloppy. My co-workers are ok. some of them are pretty stuck up others are really enjoyable to work with.
good,"I really enjoyed working here, i would come in an hour or so early (5am) just to get a jump start because it was going to be a busy day. working here i learned how to manage my time a lot better because filling 50+ cake orders in one day is pretty intense! my managment team was amazin and worked around my scheduled really well. the hardest part of the job was unloading freezer trucks because i was constantly in and out of the cold and heat for about 4 hours."
good,We believe in helping one another out in order to accommodate customers an ensure a pleasant shopping experience at the store.
good,"My concern was to report to work on time and as scheduled and to grasp any skills to enhance advancement within the company, I appreciated the opportunity for growth."
good,"Walmart provides the opportunity to participate in new change management projects. Such as, the new way of working Proto Stores, technology, and reno."
good,"Considering I was only a cashier part time, I made decent money. Unfortunately their training program is quite lacking and they do not comply with their computer based training (that earns you a raise) being completed on time."
good,It was a good experience as a cashier with customers and learn how to work with  Good Leaning experience for an cashier! Productive place to work  ! Good thing !
good,401k good benefits profit sharing stocks u recognized for your hard work part time and full time work available yearly raises plus merit raises very friendly work place!
good,trabajo en equipo y mucha competitividad excelente ambiente de trabajo
good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers because they taught me a lot, considering it was my first time in retail. I loved that I had customers that would ask for my help every time they had come into the store."
good,"Great place to work people always frinendly management team , never to be found with lots of read in between the lines statements to move up in the company"
good,"Working for Walmart isn't bad until management screws with you and your ability to come back to work after any kind of incident.  Being on the IMS team is pretty repetitive work unloading trucks, sorting freight, and stocking shelves (depending on the shift you work)."
good,"Great place to work if working full time or need extra hours; if retired and just want to work part-time, they still schedule you for 8-9 hr days--sometimes hard for older workers to do. I applaud Walmart's decision to start paying it's hourly employees at least $9/hr. It's still not much and lower than the hourly pay at McDonalds (9.25), but it's a start."
good,I like my job I just wish management would listen to us more. I been working for Wal-Mart for 5 years I have management experience in meat I help fill in when my department manager is not there. I help order. Do price changes and change on hands when we don't have the item  and make sure things get done and I help with inventory every month
good,"o Walmart foi uma CIA que me recebeu muito bem, apesar de toda minha inexperiência na área Logística. Tanto a Direção quanto os demais funcionários sempre foram muito prestatvivos, companheiros  e respeitáveis."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es hecho por los empleados y no por los jefes de area, la convivencia es persona a persona todos los dias, poca motivación manejada."
good,A typical day at work is great sometimes and not so great. I learned that you have to figure things out on your own. Management is alright there. My coworkers are sometimes helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning all of the departments in the store. The enjoyable part is interacting with customers.
good,"great place to work to begin your career, low pay, good hours, great manager, good 15 minute paid breaks, 1 hours not paid lunches"
good,"The work at the Vision Center is a challenging yet rewarding experience.  I enjoy welcoming new or previous patients and helping them with their ophthalmic needs.  I also enjoy checking in all of the new glasses that arrive.  Checking them on the lensometer to verify the written script, then properly adjusting the frames so they are flat and true using the proper 4 point, then making adjustments with specialty tools to bring them into proper form.  Then calling the patient that their order is ready to pick up.  Most of the patients are very happy to receive that phone call."
good,They were very rude mostly the co workers.  I asked for help on my first day and was told do it yourself by someone who was supposed to be training me.
good,"I worked at Walmart as a cashier, I enjoyed communicating with the customers, staying busy and worked well with all of my co workers."
good,"A typical day of work is clocking in and helping customers. Through out the day I rotate from customer service to bagging. I answer phones, make calls, help customers, bag prescriptions, put up inventory, clean, and do opening and closing duties. I learned everything I needed to know to be a cashier in a pharmacy. Management in the pharmacy was generally nice to work with. My co-workers were nice to work with. The hardest part of the job would be the not so nice customers. Over all the job was an enjoyable place to work."
good,Working here was alright. I had a problem with one manager but so did a lot of other people. I was always busy so the day went by fast. You get an hour lunch which is also nice.
good,"A typical work day consisted of checking out customers and asking if they found everything to their liking. I learned to have a lot of patience when it comes to being a cashier or stocker because a lot of people like to be difficult or rude. The management at walmart wasnt the greatest but they did their best. The hardest part about my job was when customers were rude and disrespectful to me and other associates. The most enjoyable part of my job was being more out there, talking to more people and interacting with other people that shared the same interests at work as i did."
good,"4 stars"
good,As an associate of Wal-Mart you get to help many people from different walks of life.  In the deli you may be helping the mom who has to make nourishing lunches for her kids or put a party tray together to help a family celebrate an event.  You get to work as a team member working towards a common goal which is customer satisfaction.
good,"I worked at a regional dc as an orderfiller for 6 years.  The job is easy.  The work extremely physical.  The pay is great, walmart has a reasonable attendance program in place currently.  It's pretty stress full at first..once your body becomes used to the work it's pretty much stress free.  Your success at walmart depends entirely on how you carry yourself and how you get along with managers.  Do the job...make production and you'll be fine, it's not for the weak."
good,"I worked for the vision center inside Walmart. My typical day consisted of helping patient's with their optical needs, working in the lab to help cut and grind lenses, Pulling and verifying insurances, Inputting prescriptions into the point of sale system. I have learned a great deal about optics. My boss was very helpful with any questions I may have had, as well as great with the patient's. My coworkers were great to work with, fun to be around, We would go out after work and just have fun. The most enjoyable part of my day has always been the patient's, The hardest part of my job was not enough time in the day,"
good,Good place to start working. They are understanding and work with you. They train you to be able to help in different areas. Was good to be diverse in different areas of the store
good,"You need to pull your own weight and be a team player. If you dont you will not be liked for long. I believe in that a lot."
good,I've liked the place so far. I can't complain as far as money wise. I do like it. Definately have to work for what you earn in this place. Especially being on Cap 2. But I like having to stay busy. It passes the time away fairly quickly.
good,"Trabalhar nessa empresa precisa ter minha força de vontade, e não pode deixar levar pelos outros"
good,I was responsible for packing and shipping out orders two different Walmart supercenters.  As well as unloading tractor trailers with incoming supplies.
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar en walmart  ya que existe un bien ambiente laboral, así mismo comprendí que existen áreas en los cdis que tienen sus propias reglas para operar."
good,Productive fast and friendly . I really would have liked if management understood more of the life situations and would have been more corporative and tried to word with the associates schedule instead of brushing of certain situations .
good,J'ai appris à travailler rapidement et appris à faire de la caisse
good,They treat you very good. If you are in a good store you can bonus 4 times out of the year up to 550$. That counts to all employees. The only problem I had was with managers at my store. Some managers dont know how to treat people or even talk to them.
good,Not enough communication between shifts. other than that a great place to work at. i would come in and stock all the merchandise i was responsible for in a timely manner. i really enjoy all the different people i meet on a daily basis.
good,"The company and all management have always treated me with respect and I have been able to make my way up the ladder in just a few years to become an assistant manager in a supercenter. It has been a great experience and I've met so many great people. As with retail, you have good days and bad days, customers that make your day and those who try to ruin it--but I have so many fun stories to share with people because of my time working here."
good,"The worst part of the job was lower management. They just didn't know what they were doing and made everything worse. The upper management was great, probably the best management staff I have worked with."
good,"Working at walmart has become a tedious and unwelcoming experience. I have gone from working 24+ hours a week to only 13 due to hour cuts, after being told that my hours will go up. The management does not seem to care about their employees and only their bottom dollar"
good,Assisting the photographer a fun jobs making appointment helping others with their photos sitting standing I was there to help
good,"Customer relations"
good,I liked the social aspect as i met a lot of individuals during the duration of my job. It was a pretty simple job that I benefited from in the customer service field. From my time at Walmart i can say that I have gained great customer service skills that i will carry on with me for the rest of my life.
good,"Working at Walmart, I did grocery returns most of the time. The hardest part is trying to learn so much and not really getting the help desired on the job. I would prefer to work in an environment where it is easier to feel like it is possible to succeed."
good,"The working environment was very cut and dry, we all had our daily quota we needed to meet as far as working assignments. The management was very professional, very open minded to training any aspects the job title held and very much a part of the entire floor team. Was nit satisfied with the layoffs, for the layoffs came very sudden at a night notice lraving a lot of the employees a strange for work"
good,"Start with cleaning and sterilizing, then prepare hot and cold foods, prepare the work station. To be cautious in whatever your doing. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Meeting new people."
good,typical day consist of me stocking to store. correctly pricing my area and assisting the customers. Due to my site being a brand new store there were a lot of bugs to work with the computer systems. That taught me patience and helped me better my knowledge on the errors.
good,"great job if looking for flexibility , not much room for growth, and management needs to work on how to communicate with there workers."
good,"the most enjoyable part of working at Wal mart was working with the associate and helping the customers out. I have learned to set modlars, run register, how to read the reports that come down on a daily basis, weekly and monthly. the hardest part of the job was family time and work, working 10/12 plus hours and when you was scheduled for 10 or 12 and having to stay to dealing with other shifts problems"
good,I enjoyed working for walmart because it kept me busy. I never had extra time to twiddle my thumbs. Most coworkers help everyone out more than it looks.
good,"love the customers. most of the supervisors are great. some of the shifts are not good and their company policy of time off is terrible. i took time to have teeth pulled for upper plate. bled fir 3 days each time. took two trips to surgeon. called in every day and they fired me for taking too many days off in one quarter. but said i could be rehired, just reapply"
good,"At the time was a good place to work, management and co workers created fun atmosphere. Management willing to help your progression up the ladder. Over all good experience."
good,"its a good place to work and you will always have something to do,things to remember is that bad customers do exist and it gives you prespective of what its like beign an associate"
good,"Team work for this company was very important, also time management.  day to day schedules needed to be well planned.  flow of inventory needed to be ahead of schedule."
good,"A typical day here depends on the time of hour but it was usually crowded at times. Several customers in each department shopping for something. I learned a lot while here; mostly about retail and electronics. And also how to ultimately satisfy the customer. While here my co-workers were awesome. Each and every one of them knew their role and provided it to our department making it easier on our individual selves. When one of us didn't know what to do, we'd help one another with the task. I'd say the hardest part at this job was being able to maintain order in the electronics department and the photo department at the same time with just a few employees. The most enjoyable part would probably be working as a department, making sure all customers are taken care of."
good,I came in contact with a lot of great people and learned a lot but at the end of it all management wasn't that great and they didn't pay you for your over time
good,"Levo dessa empresa uma larga experiencia profissional,com experiência na supervisão de equipes, planejamento de vendas, prospecção e fidelização de clientes, e acompanhamento das atividades de campo."
good,"The stores are pretty much always clean. Never any major messes. The management system is willing to work with you if am emergency arises or if there is a day you cannot be available to work. The work environment is friendly, there is no discrimination towards anyone. Everyone gets a fair chance at promotion, nobody is told they cannot apply. Willing to let you transfer jobs within the building."
good,Overall Walmart is a good company to work for and I was sorry to have to leave.  I learned many thing and still had more to learn.  Being a supervisor gives you the ability to make a difference in the daily operations of the company.  I had both good and bad experiences as well as good and bad managers.
good,Walmart is a great place to work I had schooling and wanted furher my education and and get a trade I can have for the future to come I gained a lot of skills to add with my current skills I had already
good,"Answered multi-phone lines, provided satisfying customer service to customers, checked daily drawer to assure cash was available for cashiers, assisted assistant managers and store manager."
good,I answer phones as where I am is the main phone line. I interact with customers all day & I love my job. I get along with my coworkers & we all work together. I am never asked to do anything I can't do.
good,"I have good hours, i learned a lot from this job with building a good work ethic and being professional with my coworkers and management and most importantly the customers, i agree very much with the department manager on most of the stuff he decides. However, the assistant manager over me i do not agree with nor respect because of his morals and i challenge his decision making on several topics, which is why i'm looking for other employment opportunities. The most important part of a work day is probably getting the opportunity to show off how hard i work infront of the store owner."
good,The Bentonville store was ran very well. Everyone work closely together were always happy. Most of our customers were frequent and loved going to the store. Our managers always took care of employees and customer and the store was extremely well kept. However the Neosho store i went to afterwards wasnt as good.  The teamwork between associates was good but the store to me didnt seem to run like it should. Customer Service was good but compared to Bentonville i felt alot of it missing.
good,"I love my job. The people aren't always very nice but I usually try to keep smiling and see what I can do to help. Management, most are okay. Some need better skills at communicating clearly and how to talk to people if they really want to be heard."
good,"They overwork you, don't give over Time. if you have over time  you'll have to cut it. They also break a lot of Osha rules. The backroom is not a safe environment."
good,"Had fun almost everyday, people were very easy to develop. Problem solving was very enjoyable. promoting hourly associates to management was so fulfilling."
good,"This job was ever changing and you never knew what kind of day it was gonna be but I enjoyed that. There was always something new to learn or a different experience to be had. I learned management skills, how to be a team player, and how to handle upset customers with care. I loved meeting new people and enjoyed the people I worked with. One thing that was not my favorite is we were always short handed but there were always plenty of managers. It made things difficult sometimes but I enjoyed a challenge."
good,The company has drama on the daily. I have learned great cashiering skills and money handling. The people in Management were pretty rude! Co-Workers always talked about one another. The most enjoyable part about this company was being able to interact with the customers.
good,"It was busy but nice. I was trained as a CSM but didn't get the title but I was scheduled as a CSM most of the time. Management was good and understanding, some was willing to work around certain situation for scheduling"
good,"Tienen buenas formas de implementar la cultura y el ambiente es agradable. Se te brinda la capacitaciôn adecuada para cada àrea que ofrecen, sin embargo, el sueldo no es muy bueno."
good,I left from CVS/health and I have never regretted my decision to leave. I have better relations with my coworkers and pharmacists and the customers were more pleasant
good,"Highly active but steady paced, management willing to work side by side with employees, open for advancement, and gave praise when it was needed, well rounded company."
good,Typical day at wal mart in giving excellent customer service and helping other co-workers out. Hardest part of the job would be when you're working alone.
good,Working here i had a very good hands on experiance dealing with customer's and helping them with there need's. Learned to trouble shoot problems when they occur to make sure the customer always leaves happy and wanting to return shopping
good,A typical day at work is scripted to the letter. The workplace rules instill discipline and orderliness. I always signed in and reported to duty with pride.
good,"•	Represented the company with outstanding Customer Service"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart and would have Liked to stay there, but internal ( store) problems would not allow me to advance."
good,"Work was work.When I came in I clocked in, met with the manager, I  then got my schedule and my equipment and began the work shift. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 3 AM for my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was, without a doubt, them checks every two weeks!"
good,"As an intake/inventory control clerk (slotter) the pace is very fast, typically handling 4-5 unload doors at a time with 2 unloaders in each door.  There is little to no room for error as the functionality of all aspects of the warehouse rests solely on your shoulders.  The Traffic Office aspect of my job is very fast paced as well with 75-100 trucks inbound on a slow week with 2500+/- on each truck and a dozen carrier companies, each with their own style of doing things.  It is fun and challenging every day and you never run out of things to learn. Management is touch and go as there are 60 or so managers in the  building which I work in and they each have their own management style."
good,"le empresa tiene una cultura con 4 puntos muy importantes, respeto al individuo, servicio al cliente, búsqueda de la excelencia e integridad. aprendí en ser un liderar como modelo a seguir dirigiendo al personal y cumplir las peticiones de la gerencia, ya que tuve como principal objetivo mantener las instalaciones en optimas condiciones"
good,I worked at wal0mart for about eight months. Very great place to work at. They are very good about giving their employees raises. I enjoyed the hour lunch break. The only thing I don't miss are the long lines around the evening hours.
good,The best part of the job is when customers are so nice and thank you for helping them. Its nice that we get a discount card. Some Managers are nice. Some hard parts of the job are the rude customers who no matter what you try to do to fix the situation just doesn't please them.
good,"Within a slighly hectic enviornment I was able to give many classes both to small groups and individuals with the company rendering good results. "
good,"sometimes it does get boring and frustrated and we always work together sometimes there's no help. but overall I love working there although I don't get as many hours that I want to. my co-workers are all nice they tell me what to do in other postions. hardest part is having the meat wall up and ready by myself @9. most enjoyable part is lunch sometimes, lol. but it be some excited moments going on sometimes. I learned more about the meat counter and dairy and how it all happens"
good,Walmart has a good working culture. Opportunities to learn and grow and everyday new learning's. Walmart training material is very effective for employees.
good,Walmart was a good starting point for me and it was an overall nice job.                                                                              .
good,Hard job with no room to grow. People working there are focused and motivated to reach production. They do not take injuries or safety seriously. Pay is great though.
good,"Good place to work, my co workers were very nice. I learned to work in different departments in the store which i enjoyed. The pay at the time could have been better."
good,Currently work Tuesday through Friday. Operate a PE around the warehouse and load specific products onto pallets and deliver to the shipping area to be loaded. Our crew on our shift now consist of 5 personnel. Requires a lot of manual labor but everyone works well together.
good,"A typical work day included: greeting the customers, having a clean work station, scanning merchandise, processing credit and debit cards transactions. The management team was pretty laid back and nice. I learned different things via our online trainings we had to do. The hardest part was working with certain employees who never thought they were wrong. The most enjoyable part was working as a team most times."
good,Help customers needs ad wants.  Smile on people face when they  say Thank you Without customers no jobs.Assisting people should be a pleasure.  Joyful day at Walmart.
good,Associates are friendly and hours are good. Customers are mostly friendly.The people that work in my office are great and have great personalities. Overall ive learned a great deal from my fellow associates
good,Walmart was a fun place to work with many different kind of people to meet and great benefits and a lot of room to grow within the company. Most of the management really cared about the individual worker.
good,I worked at Walmart as a wireless sales representative. I really enjoyed the position. It was fast paced and challenging. There was always something new to learn. I enjoyed servicing customers and developing new tech skills.
good,"Walmart is a wonderful place to work,learn and meet interesting people.I enjoyed my time there. You are able to move up in the company if you desire.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers. The hardest part of the job is having to work short handed sometimes.Management is good.If you are young and looking for a long term career in management Walmart is a good place to start. Walmart is a good first job for many people.Offers a wide variety of jobs and schedules. If I did not think Walmart was a good place to work I would not have given them 10 years of my life. A typical day at Walmart is fun,busy and sometimes challenging. But overall I would go back"
good,I liked being a cashier because I got to communicate with the customers and see the different kinds of people that came to Walmart I didn't like that everything was a popularity contest and your coworkers were always trying to be in your personal business
good,always meeting new faces and always seeing old faces can be busy or could be slow just depending on the day and time and always never get a weekend off unless you requested it months in advance
good,Working with the customers was the best part of my day. Between opening and marking down prices. To simply assisting a customer locate and item with a smile. There was never a boring day.
good,Management always bring new and innovative ideal that help African women and vulnerable children to  have better and optimistic live.It make our world more equal and convenient
good,Walmart is great when it comes to training you and its great to university students. If you do your job well there is room for advancement in the company. I've been working there since last year and I have already been trained for courtesy desk. The staff from the supervisors to the employees are great. Management is very professional yet friendly. A typical day of work is being on a till for 3-4 hours and being on courtesy desk for 2 hours.You learn how to multi task well as well as the supervising staff is great at helping you with anything you may need.
good,I never had a typical day due do supervision of people. I learned a lot while employed there.  Most of my comments are on the other review I just completed.
good,"Co-workers are wonderful, and most everyone working at walmart.  I love the customers at jewelry counter.  Also cashier sometimes and love talking to the customers while checking them out."
good,Working at wal mart in Indiana was a great experience . The managers were friendly and positive. Overall nice environment. I also liked the support managers they really made me feel comfortable with the company.
good,"Money center is a huge responsibility only because in our register we had 12,000 dollars. Its a huge responsibility as well with trying to deal with sending money to other countries mostly to mexico. I had to analyze the customer making sure there was no suspicious activities going on due to the fact that where in the south texas region. Mostly being money center I dealt with people sending, receiving money, bill payments, cashing checks."
good,"walmart  has been a great place to work , i have learned how to receive truck loads of freight ,  placement in store , handle empolyees as a support manager over night  treat my help as my customer  so they can help the stores customer the best."
good,"Walmart is a fast paced company, it also entails an extensive set of patience for dealing with many attitudes from your customers. Knowledge of money and product placement is a plus. Management is a bit difficult to understand as management positions change often and they are not very responsive to their employees needs.The hardest part of the job is dealing with unkind customers and trying to make their needs meant. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a diversity of co-workers and the customers that appreciated your services."
good,"On a typical day i clock in and wait for the meeting to happen. i have my own area so for what i do is normal for me. i stock all soda, water, Gatorade, small juices and alcohol. In cases ive done features i help out around the store to keep it as nice as possible doing extra work. I learned a lot being that i wanted to go into a manager position to up my status and respect level.My managers overnight at least are all very helpful and much encouraging they lead by example and push me. The hardest part of my job is just the stress when i am given more tasks and responsibilities i have to be better than what i was every second before. the most enjoyable part is that i get my job done and know it was done correct."
good,Working for walmart was fun and a good experience. The one thing i did not enjoy was the management of the place. They were very rude to their employees and didn't treat them with much respect. If the management was more of a family or at least more of a team when it came to those under them it would be one of the best places.
good,"Enjoyed working with the public, making food, setting up deli cases, filling orders, cleaning, slicing meats and cheese, learning new foods and different ways to prepare them."
good,"First off I love to merchandise so as an overnight merchandiser, then manager I was able to pursue my passion. That being said company actions towards employees is what you would expect of any large corporation. The trouble that arises there is exactly the same problems you would run into at a fast food place or even a wine store."
good,"dias de doblar turno. aperturas de sucursal y atencion a clientes acomodos de mercancia, etiqueteo y compra de competencia para la señalizacion de productos"
good,"Flexible work environment, can accommodate with your personal needs, employers are friendly. Typical repetitive work environment, like scanning, processing payments, packing purchases,"
good,"A day at work consisted on me either being at customer service or on a register. If I were on the register I'd be completing transactions. If I were at the Customer Service desk, I completed any tasks necessary for customers needs. If shelves needed to be restocked or merchandise needed to be put away, I completed this as well. I enjoyed those around me. I am a very people person, and love to interact with others, so this was the perfect job, as we were always busy."
good,"Walmart was fair in all ways with the rules and jobs they provided. In my words my time their was good with Walmart. My schedule was perfectly lined up to my time in the day to work with them. Co-workers were helpfully and just wanted to get moving, so no time was wasted."
good,A typical day would be serving the customer with a smile on your face . I learned the system of how to advertise a product to get customer to purchase. Management is so overwhelmed they lack understanding good qualities of each individual employee. Co-workers are helpful when times get extremely busy. The hardest part of the job is during holiday seasons .The most enjoyable part of the job is payday .
good,They could be a lot more professional. The work environment was good. I feel like the managers could do a little more. I've learned and gained a lot of patience working here.
good,on a day to day basic ive learn how to work and consult with all different types of people and how to keep order among the staff and customers.
good,"Managers were nice and easy to work with"
good,easy enough go in star working get all your work done go home at the end of the day. get your job done and no problems. plenty of work to keep you busy through the day. costumer will keep you busy asking you question about stuff.
good,Very physical job you're pulling cases that weigh anywhere between 1 and 100lbs and stacking them up to 7 ft high two pallets at a time. Your work is judged on productivity percentages which were determined by how fast you finished each trip. The company highly stresses safety above all else. Employment with Wal-mart as an order filler taught me to be efficient and fast in what I do while at the same time keeping safe from injury or damaging inventory.
good,"Good place to work.  Hours took getting used to, but manageable once acclimated to over night schedule.   Not much interaction with customers due to the overnight hours."
good,"I asked the night manager for more hours. She turned me down. I found the Foothills job, and told the day manager I as leaving because I couldn't get more hours and he got mad. I should have been given more hours! They had a hard time getting good employees, because of dumb managers like the night manager! I really did like the Walmart job and all of the work I did."
good,"Usually very busy, with fried chicken orders, sandwich tray orders, and running the whole deli. Always exciting and new things to do. Hardest part of the job would be having to  be a bit short staffed and pulled from the department often. Overall its a great place."
good,"I worked at Walmart, in the Vision Center, for a bit over five years, and all in all I had a great experience Most of the time the work was enjoyable; adjusting glasses, helping patients, filling out orders, that was the sort of thing I did. Now, I wasn't on the floor very often, most of the time I was was going to my job up front from the back, or vice-versa. One thing I did notice was just how understaffed they were out there. From the front end Customer Service Managers and registers to even the shelf workers, many a time was that a customer was standing in a department looking for help and I had to call someone over as I was out of my expertise. Invariably that person would be busy, and they assured me that the would be there shortly. Normally, they were, so there was no issue with customer service. In fact, customer service was rarely a problem, in or out of the Vision Center, and most people I spoke to were happy with the help, or at least satisfied with the help they received. Being understaffed wasn't only a problem with the hourly, the Management were pulled tightly as well. Walmart sells guns, and a manager is required to unlock the gun case and get them for the customer. Customers would often have to wait thirty to forty minutes until a manager was available. I liked to help patients as quickly as I could so it always made me uneasy seeing that, and being unable to do anything. I would like to add that this is not something that personnel did nothing about. Often I would walk by the personnel office to see a group of new employees going through orientation. However"
good,"I learnt many thing at walmart especially how to deal with different types of customers, gained more knowledge about other products in the industry."
good,I didn't have any major issues with any of my managers but different managers defiantly make the job. If a manager will listen to the day to day issues and try to help it makes work much easier. I loved the job itself.
good,Always stay positive no matter what happens or goes down. Listen to the customers complaints and review these with a salaried  member of management to help improve the customer experience. Be helpful to other associates.
good,Days would start very early. I would work three 12 hour days and have four days off. Depending on the area of the warehouse I was working in and the time of year it would be extremely cold or extremely hot. The pay was well for my age at the time and having four days off game me time to spend with family and friends.
good,I have learned because Walmart is really a giant company. But the work culture there is not as good as I think. The coworkers there are kind of cool and nice.
good,"Walmart is the largest retailer in the world. They primarily market to a demographic that is below the median family income. For this reason, it will be hard pressed for another retailer to dethrone them any time soon."
good,I enjoyed working in the Automotive area as a service writer.  I was able to interact with other employees and help customers make decisions on what was needed to be completed on their vehicles.   I learned that there were a broad range of people who utilized the Automotive Center for the services provided.  The hardest part of the job was to write up the service contract in extreme cold weather.  The most enjoyable part was the interaction allowed with other employees and the trust given to me by supervisors and fellow workers.
good,"The typical day I have at Walmart is involved at working at the front end of the store and either providing customer support or acting as a cashier as needed. At other time I fill jobs that need to be done in a timely matter around the store."
good,"I usually start at 6 am .."
good,"Learn something differenthelp mme to grow more and moregreat benefits. "
good,"Overall fairly good company, as a whole. Employees are treated with care, consideration, and fairness. I would recommend working for this company when the opportunity presents itself."
good,"you have the chance for advancement. Long hours"
good,"Work was easy and it was always busy enough to keep you occupied but not too busy to stress you out. I was never short on hours. I got plenty of breaks throughout the day which made working in retail a lot easier. The only issue I really had was not enough training. The CBL's really don't teach you enough about what you really need to know and when I finished those, they sort of just shoved me out there when I didn't quite understand what I was doing. But I had a lot of nice coworkers that were more than willing to help out when I needed it."
good,the jobs was fun and kept you busy but when family emergencies cropped up they where not very understanding .`the benefits where good but the health care was very pricey
good,It's a good place to work. Good money and 3 days off a week. I worked there for about 12 years it's very demanding but also very rewarding
good,My co-workers made going to work everyday more enjoyable. Our customers had a way to make the day go by faster and feel like it was not just another job. Management for the most part tried to work with employees when there was some kind of issue going on at home.
good,Employer worked around my school and internship schedules and allowed me to work in several different areas to accommodate for my schooling and family life.
good,DEPENDING ON THE AREA YOU WORK AT.  Walmart to could be a great place to work. Hours are flexible. Availability is availabe but could be relatiated in hours given. Co-Workers may be frustrated at times due to the way things are managed. Low on cashiers.
good,When I first started at Walmart I was so nervous because it was different from what I had just came from. I was determined to learn all the different opportunities that Walmart had to offer. It was very fast paced and they want you to do better and move up as fast as you can handle. Everyone is friendly and communicate with you if they see a problem or have any questions. But overall I have had a great experience.
good,Overall a good job but pay is less and difficult to advance. I have done a office job for 4 years so it is a bit difficult for me to stand continuously for 8 hours.
good,A day at Walmart was mainly helping customers and zoning merchandice. the coworker are fun and the management is nice and helpful
good,If this company would thank you more  for what u do more..rather then worry about how many days someone miss..it would be more better..
good,"Work at walmart is taxing, mentally more so than physically. Unless you get lucky and get on the fast track to being a manager, you are stuck as a standard employee."
good,"Walmart is great place to work. You meet new people & learn something new everyday to help your career. Working At Walmart can also be crazy, dealing with customers & trying to make it a better place to shop."
good,"As an Optician Technician my duties were to welcome patients as they entered, booking appointments, taking eye measurements, fitting patients with frames and/or contacts, showing each patients the proper ways to clean their contacts and glasses and going over the warranty. I gained a lot of knowledge from the experience at "
good,"I worked in the deli department. I waited on customers and also did the stock and freight for the department. It's hard work, customers aren't always nice, but the company is a good one and the people you work with make it worth it."
good,Very productively always busy from start to end of shift. Management not so good. Big turn around on employees.
good,Me gusto trabajar en equipo con mis compañeros de trabajo jefe de dpto excelente te actualiza día a dia la gerencia muy bien tiene disposicion para escucharte jefes subjefes dptos subgerentes y gerentes los felicito me gusta su forma de trabajo y su atención al cliente
good,"I learned to think fast on my feet , very busy environment must be able to keep up with the diversity of the community and associates."
good,"Flexible hours, manager didn't really care when you left, as long as you stayed for at least half your time and finished your work. Sometimes, you had to stay a little longer if they were expecting more work later in the day."
good,"Good days do exist at Walmart. I most definitely love my regular customers and for the new customers I make sure they have a good experience to where they would want to come back. I enjoy my coworkers they respect me as a woman and as there boss. They know if they need help I'm their, to either help them with a car, customer, or to move up the ladder. The hardest part about my job is when I do have to come hard on my associates because they take shortcuts. To me in this industry shortcuts are a no go. People invest good money the their cars and if they are going to do the job they have to do it right."
good,"There was so much to do, from price changes to complete modular changes. Days would typically fly by but stress was high due to the varied tasks throughout the day."
good,"Wal-Mart is great place for anyone to work, Equal opportunity and awesome benefits for all levels of associates that work at the company (medical dental, vision, 401k [company match up to 6%], and stock options [company also give .15 cents for every $1 that you put into buying stock. Everyone gets company paid short term disability[cover 50% of wages]. Flexible and great growth opportunities. The company had been wrongly accused of quite a few thinks, that aren't true. They have positions for everyone. Company is pretty awesome, Who else does so much for their associates."
good,"fun place to work at if you like working fast."
good,"Good company to work for, but hard on the feet, back & hips. Management were all great.  Salary was fair.  I enjoyed working at that store."
good,I liked the people I worked with otherwise I would not have stayed at Walmart as long as I did. Had good benefits for those who had full time hours.
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience for my work ethnic and experience, but the people's attitude's were very sour, and became very cliquish and anti-social over the months of people quitting."
good,"saw many changes some good some not"
good,"My typical  is very nice, I'm there  every day,Management is good to me I like to work with my co worker,Is when I see the cosmer have a good day at Walmart"
good,working with others as a team can be quiet fun at times and it helps get things done in a timely fashion. Also management tries to work with you when you need time off of work during an illness or family emergency.
good,"A typical day of work is mostly greeting customers at the door and looking for sighs of theft."
good,I enjoyed my 6 years being at Wal-Mart. I learned so much from the me being a Sale Associate to even my training on become a Customer Service Manager. The people that I worked with became family to me and my family. I learn so much of how to encounter dad to day people that came in the store to shop. Encountering different walks of life each day with different kind of people taught me a great deal of how to entreat anyone no matter who they are.
good,"Ran a register, stocked shelves, assisted other departments when needed, set appointments for tire changes and other car services, set shelves per planograms, recovered/front face shelves, provided excellent customer service to customers and associates, maintained stock room, issued fishing licenses, mixed paint, scanned out and disposed of damaged merchandise, and managed several associates."
good,"busy,  learned of products being transferred and sent to different parts of state and beyond  management was good   co-workers were great,  easy going   hardest part of job was time from 2:00 pm to 12:00 midnight   enjoyable, was good people to work with"
good,"I was raised in Bentonville Arkansas, and walmart was always been a part of part of background life. my mother work for both the company as well as its vendors. its pretty much the only game in town. its a massive company that really wants to retain its small business roots. it fails at it more often than not though."
good,estaba bien pero pagaban muy poco estaba cerca de mi casa esperaba crecer en la empresa
good,"I was working the overnight shift. It was very laid-back. Wasn't too many customers coming in."
good,"Ensure proper maintenance of stock records and record inventory."
good,I was hired when staff shortages were taking place and when there were lots of applicants for limited positions. I worked hard. The supervisors showed me lots of patience with me. I loved the gals I worked with.
good,"Llegar a tu lugar de trabajo, revisar los pendientes de un día antes, sacar reportes de los artículos que están en negativo, darlos a los asociados de los distintos departamentos para que hagan los conteos requeridos y actualizar los inventarios, checar los artículos agotados, hacerles pedidos, realizar transferencias, dar ordenes de compra a los proveedores, pagar facturas, etc."
good,"La gerencia tiene un buen trato hacia los empacadores, así como también les aplica reglas, descansos y castigos."
good,My typical day included folding tables and zoning. I helped with Jewelry Sales as needed. This was a very exciting job as I was only 16 when I started. I loved working with apparel.
good,"mi dia tipico empezaba con un buen desayuno aprendi mucho aii me enseñaron a hacer de todo fui administrador, montacarguista, almacenisata, vendedor, resepcionista, cocinero, cajero"
good,"Walmart is not the amazing company it once used to be.  It was a secure and steady job for me.  However, things were not done as professionally as they should have been."
good,Couldn't get any over time and if you did you would get in trouble along with having to go home early. Management was horrible and I will never work there again. Only reason I went back was to help out and I figured since there was a new boss it would have been better and it wasn't.
good,"This store is the same one in Cedar Rapids I started at in 2009, I transferred to Ames in 20012,  then back to be closer to home in 2013."
good,"A typical day at work is never the same. Everyday you learn something new or see something new. I've learned that communication is the key to being successful. You have to ask questions in order to get a better understanding. But with the help of my fellow co-workers and management I was able to overcome a lot of obstacles. The managers are very understanding and helpful which plays a big roll when your training. That's why i'm still standing after 1 year and 4 months. Overall , the hardest part of my job at Walmart was learning all the different codes , fruits , and vegetables. But there is nothing I do not know about them now. The customers be so amazed at my speed. The most enjoyable part about being at Walmart is putting that wonderful smile on each and everyone of my customers face ..... well most of them."
good,Hardware sales associate. Cashiering. Stock shelves. Wherever they needed you...you went. Hardest part was the fast pace. Most enjoyable part were the people.
good,"It was nice, everyone was friendly and the job was very easy. Something about the management gave me the heebie geebies but they were all nice people."
good,"Always something to do. Easy to work with schedules, usually. Easy to move up within the company. The fun at work depends on the department you work in. Not all areas are as busy as others."
good,"i learned a lot at walmart, it was awesome. the first few weeks will be tough, especially if your not used to the warehousing responsibilities. but eventually you will catch on and be very urgent just likie everyone else. the people there are really nice and its really diverse"
good,"I learned how to multitask better! I love helping customers find a difficult items they need! My day started by doing trash duties,clean restrooms,spot mop where it is needed,sweeping and picking up spills!"
good,Empresa donde uno estima los valores personales y morales de una organización
good,A typical day at Walmart is a first slow until about lunch time it can get pretty busy for about an hour and picks up a again around 3 until about 7 that night. The biggest thing I've  learn working at Walmart is to never judge anyone because you don't know what they are/have been going through. Management are great people who care for the employees that work for them. My co-workers are great hard working people who care about the customers that shop at the store. The hardest part of the job is that when we don't have something they are  looking and we have to tell them we don't carry that product. The most enjoyable part of the job is that when we have a the product that the customers is looking for and we can take them to the product and seeing the smile on their faces and the joy of know you made their day better.
good,"store mgmt seemed scared of misstepping and displeasing their supervisors lest they put their jobs ""for which  they were well compensated"".This apprehension affected their management style. There was one efficient,affable manager, but  he got promoted after 11/2 years (of the twelve I was with them).  However, once I had learned my job days or weeks could  pass without even a""good morning"". It was very pleasing to surprise customers with good or exceptional service. I also enjoyed working with many who could and did give great service to our customers ."
good,"Good management with managers with 20+ years of experience,it was very helpful for the project to move on and take  suggestions from them. Very organised planning about the meetings."
good,I especially learned to familiarize myself with American food and provide good customer service. The store and staff management was performed by qualified professionals. Some coworkers were nice and some others focused on the work to be done. The hardest part of the job was to struggling not to fall asleep during the overnight shift and the most enjoyable was the time you were done all the assigned tasks before the clock. You felt as you were gaining more experience every other day.
good,"I enjoy working with my co workers. our break room is great. You can either join in the banter or read my book."
good,"Walmart is a good place to interact with customers and meeting new people, that the fun about this job it jus gets frustrating sometimes to. you can learn a lot at Walmart and about Walmart easy to get promoted as well and hard work pays off"
good,"If you have no college background and need a job, Wal-Mart could be the place for you. They offer competitive wages for the work you do but when business is slow you may get layed off."
good,Loved helping people. Learned a lot about dealing with the customer and talking to people. Some managers are great some not so good. Pick and choose your battles.
good,"I was a cashier at walmart. My typical day of work would consist of checking out customers and greeting them. One thing have  I learned working at Walmart is that.  Walmart really appreciate their customers. The management was nice, they are helpful and friendly. The co -workers were ok they were nice and friendly. The hardest part of this job was nothing at all. The enjoyable part of this job is that you meet new people and it can be fast pased and busy but I like that."
good,I liked working here but the manager at the time was not a people person and we did not get along very well. I would follow the rules of the classes but get told to do differently by management.
good,Concentrated only to work hard and be ready to work hard again.This actually provide habit to work without seupervision
good,"I worked here from the time I was 18 and on and I just started school and they wouldn't work with me as far as my school schedule went. They told me I had a choice to make, So I choose school."
good,es muy buen trabajo mas para los estudiantes en esta empresa recompensan tus esfuerzos como el seguir estudiando con un incentivo si hay presión pero es lo normal en cualquier empleo
good,"Working for  Walmart has taught me that freight can and will be moved with stride. 10pm - 7am goes by quick considering one has a hour ""lunch"" break. One mainly works alone, but if one needs hel it is offered! Training usually last about 3 nights."
good,"Aprendizaje en la mayoría de los departamentos y áreas de la empresa, tales como; realización de pedidos, manejo de promotores y proveedores, atención siempre al cliente, utilización de los programas de la empresa, realización de inventarios."
good,"It is a good starter job. I love meeting new people everyday there. Most customers were really nice if I was nice to them. My co-works were great, most helped out a lot when needed."
good,"a good place to work.I miss the people and my regular customers.I learned something every day,be good or bad.Most every one helped me adapt to the difference in the registers.The hardest part was difficult customers and the best part was great customers."
good,"This was my first job and the first year I loved it. Over the last 6 months, things got really bad. Firing people based on points, bad management, and co-workers not doing what they are supposed to do. It is really easy to learn, the customers are nice and patient if you let them know you are still learning. I learned how to count money faster, speak to customers appropriately, and stock. The management was okay. The thing that really got under my skin was when the lines were long, they would just tell us to work faster, and they would sit there and watch without helping. The co-workers are great depending on who they are. They love to help you out when you need it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with WIC. The first few times are intimidating, but it got easier. Noted, people get frustrated really quickly with WIC so be calm and have sympathy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts."
good,"Typically a day at work starts out stressful. Working over night you have to immediately start doing the trash and hangers up front, which isn't bad if you didn't have a manager telling you to do one thing and two others telling you to do two other things. Management wasn't bad. They were nice people just didn't communicate well. I loved my co-workers, they were nice and accepting of things. The hardest part of my job was trying to work with several different instructions and not knowing what to do. However, I did enjoy working with most of the people I worked with."
good,One a typical day early clock in and on time. Review work assignment. Received supplies for assignment. The hardest part of my job was unable to achieve more then I wanted
good,"ouvrir et fermer la caisse,servir les clients avec un sourir,faire le menage des lieux"
good,"I learned how to work better as a team. I always communicated with management to make sure I was doing exactly what they were asking me to do. Most co-workers were fun to work with, and would all know what they were supposed to do to make sure tasks got completed, and done right. Hardest part was the miscommunication between workers at times."
good,"On a normal day at work I'd be greeted by customers and employees.  Everyone there was nice to me except one manager.  She would call me in the office when I was about to clock in and then yell at me for clocking in late after I left her office.  Besides that, I had a great time working there and if that specific manager ever leaves I will be reapplying."
good,"Worked in Tire and Lube. Was usually short handed so techs in the shop had to also run register inside. Learned a lot about different cars  . The summer and rain sucked because it was super hot, and tires were muddy and cold and wet during rain."
good,"wal-mart life was great, times the management could be unprofessional .but other than that, i loved my job and being a customer service manager.."
good,"I preform many duties as a connection center associate. Helping out in electronics, photo lab, some times toys, or the front end cashiering. I maintain records of phone sales, and customer contracts, audit inventory on a daily basis, and primarily help customers."
good,"My time at this company provided me with many skills that include customer service knowledge, supervising role, timely manner tasks,"
good,"Buena empresa con lineamientos claros, aunque sacrificado en cuanto a plantilla de trabajo, en general se considera buena empresa."
good,"Average job, lots of interaction with other people, team environment, friendly staff, hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers"
good,I've been a cashier for 8months now and I've been trying to move up and they just don't allow me to. Associates are great except for tle associates they are nuts. Overall if u want a job that you will never move up in Walmart is the one for you
good,"Work was well paced and they set reasonable goals each night. Management always pushes to do our best and keeps an eye on their employees and what is being sent onto the sales floor. Co-workers are hard working and friendly, making you feel like part of the family right away. The hardest part of working as an overnight Stocker was getting used to the scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to have been the wonderful co-workers and how friendly they were."
good,"Fun team to work with.  Good pay, and benefits. To many Market visits, keeps you from doing your job. The hardest part of the day is keeping up with changing policies. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to help out others with their problems."
good,"a typical day at Walmart start at about 6am for me, walked in ready to go, would clock in up front then make my way to the back, where my dep. was, saying hi to my co workers as I passed them, saying good morning to the customers I saw while making my way. From there, got the registers set up and ready for the day, then went about my day greeting customers, asking if they needed help finding anything, while making time to get the shelves stalked and store organized"
good,"Great company to work for if you are fully staffed, management is helpful, and co-workers are helpful. If not then you're gonna have a bad time."
good,"i learned a lot of things working here, the management here wasn't as great, the coworkers were helpful, i enjoyed helping the customers"
good,"Supervised six Department Managers and Associates with in the departments.  Attended Wal-Mart Store Management Training , Leadership Foundations I and Leadership Foundation II.  Served as the store's Loss Prevention Coordinator.  Enjoyed working with all of the Associates within my department.  Learned quickly how to adjust to many adverse situations and to respond with a immediately sense of urgency."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Pharmacy, helping customers was rewarding, and Wal-Mart offered me a very flexible schedule as a full-time student"
good,"Great place to work, flexible schedules and paid vacations. Get a long well with all coworkers, treat you like family. Earn quarterly bonuses is a plus."
good,Walmart as been a great company to work for. There are plenty of advancement opportunities and good benefits. When I first started Walmart had a great profit sharing program also this has recently been discontinued. They do have a good stock buying program where they contribute 15 % of what you purchase.
good,"- Managers are nice"
good,"This is one of the most bigger company in the word,"
good,Everyday I go into work I am assigned tasks to complete throughout the day. The best part of my day is when I can help an upset customer and turn their experience into a better one. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer because we are simply out of stock of a product at the moment. My co-workers are an enjoyable group of people to be around and we are very productive. Management can be a little scattered but the job gets done.
good,It was fun to wait on people with their groceries and talk with them but they could be beligerant. There was good people skills.
good,"Walmart  as stocker /2nd shift was a great job, wery fast paced, great people to work for. Would have stayed however, they reduced hours significantly in January, therefore, I was unable to stay."
good,I will never have a bad word to say about this company.  Many opportunities for advancement within and the management that I had was amazing.
good,"Some of the managers do not care about the poeple they care about them selves. My manager knew about the issues with my attendace score and that it needed to be fixed because of his scheduleing mistakes, he fired me over the issue instead of fixing it. I was only supposed to have 7 pts and I eneded up having 11 due to him, and I am the one that got fired. Brought it to the store manager and was told that he dose not talk to employees about those issues, and that it is up to the assistant managers decision."
good,i did have some fun working with some of the employees at walmart as well as the customers.it is a fast pace job. when i first worked there they had it so that we made an extra dollar an hour on sunday. if they brought that back it would be awesome
good,I enjoyed working here for the time that I did. Although I don't think there was much room for advancement. I liked that everything was routine and was well organized.
good,I appreciate Walmart giving me a chance to be hired on as a Manager off the street!  They gave me a chance to learn the Transportation Industry and expand my management skills. I have benefited tremendously from my time with Walmart. I will miss our wonderful team and the fun I had there.
good,"Unfortunately the position I have does not allow for a equal work/life balance. "
good,"A typical day for me, would usually start around 10:00 pm to 7:00 am. I would go in on overnights to help finish unloading the merchandise truck if they were backed up. I would then go to the department I was assigned to an stock the merchandise on the pallets I had. When I'm done with that department, I would go to my next department and stock that merchandise and zone as I go along, making sure my area was clean and straight. I learned how to unload a truck, stock, and use cash registers. Management was sometimes a little to strict on their employees. They their employees more like factory workers than a team. I made friends with all of my co-workers, to where we would sometimes carpool together. The hardest part of the job, would have to be if you needed to get your days off changed or if you gave them an advance a few weeks ahead of time that you would need time off. The most enjoyable part of my job was making new friends and meeting new people."
good,Through a typical day. I would work on the truck team. We would unload the truck and place inventory on the floor for the stock team to restock shelves. Occasionally the truck team would have to do the stocking until the over night stock team got in.
good,"typical day at work we usually zone, clean up, and stock the items for the day. I learned a lot about televisions, cell phones, tablets, and how to speak to the public. management was fine only thing I dislike was the scheduling. Co-workers were great to get alone with. After I got familiar with the job it wasn't really a hard task for me. I enjoyed helping others and brightening up people days."
good,Working at walmart is fun and all but if you are a student athlete i highly stress that you really tell your boss about your athletic times. If not your schedule will be messed up and if they work around it you will be satisfied with your checks. Most enjoyable part was meeting new employees and sometimes the customers. Most hardest part maintaining the job and athletic schedule.
good,a typical day at walmart for me was to come in and start our meeting which would last between 5- 30 minutes long. Our management was okay one felt like they didnt have to work and the other join our team.
good,"capping inventory and pulling out products to go to the sales floor, loading products on a blue cart and pulling it to the sales floor to stock shelves. co-workers are knowledgeable and helpful on less stressful days fun to be around. the most enjoyable part of the job is to help the customers find what they are looking for. Management is helpful but not to personable. The hardest part of the job is lifting very heavy boxes by yourself."
good,Management is respectful and everyone is outgoing and easy to get along with. Excellent training and 20% discount card. Plus holiday pay vacation pay sick leave 401k.
good,"On the job site, I have had the opportunity to learn as a cashier. Walmart is a decent place to work for entry level job candidates. They offer many levels of advancement and allow you to move up in the company as you see fit. If you enjoy working in a retail environment and have skills they can use, it may work well for you."
good,"A typical day while working at Wal-Mart consisted of making sure the cash register was balanced before the store opened, making sure the shelves were stocked and making sure they stayed tidy as well as serving customers at the cash register and providing information about our products.."
good,"aprendizaje de ensamble en motocicletas"
good,"WM es una buena empresa, donde puedes crecer a largo plazo, y aprender se trabaja bajo presión en temas salariales es competitivo en general hay que saber llevar el trabajo para salir con el, mis colegas eran muy buenas personas con muchísimo conocimiento del sistema y de la cultura en si de walmart , la parte mas dificil del trabajo es el traslado a las oficinas de WM en forum 2 santa ana, lo que me gusto fue todo lo que aprendi de excel, sap y la facilidad de plabara que adquiri"
good,"Overnight Electronics Associate, 2009-2010"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work you are always busy. The management needs changes; the managers of the Walmart that I work at needs more experience. Most of them didn't go to college on management and I feel like it took a big toll on my current store. The managers act inexperienced and make horrible decisions everyday. It is enjoyable helping customers and getting my job complete. I do like most of my managers and they're really nice people to work with, but the inexperience in the work environment is way to unacceptable for me and a lot of my co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working here and was able to make a lot of friends.  there are many schedules to follow and time frames but it kept everyone organized.  I got to meet new people and was still able to work enough hours and still attend college.  They are very flexible with your work schedule.
good,It was an overall good experience.  The csms did a good job of scheduling breaks and lunches.  I feel that this company makes a good effort to treat employees with respect and appreciation for a job well done.
good,"If you have worked retail for one company, you have pretty much worked it everywhere. In my opinion, Retail is the same wherever you go."
good,"Fast pace work environment"
good,"Walmart was an excellent place to work. There was training and opportunity for growth in every department. I trained new employees, took over for employees who left for health reasons and was able to help the team whenever and as much I could."
good,"IT is a fabulous place to work with people who become like family. It is job that takes getting used to. customers can be hard to work with at times, but happens everywhere."
good,this job was frustrating in that it provided enough income to convince someone to take on financial responsibilities but not enough to do much else the time requirements were such that searching for other means of employment/income was next to impossible
good,I was always busy processing returns and putting them back on the shelves. The hardest part of the job was remembering where everything went. The most enjoyable part was working with other associates and helping customers the best I could. Managers were very understanding if something personal happened.
good,"I started at Walmart as a cashier then moved up to a customer service cashier, where I returned and exchanged merchandise. While working in customer service I also worked in money center cashing checks and sending money for customers."
good,walmart is a good place to work but the new management they bring in is not that good...They need to train manager better and employeere will work better.
good,"fun workplace, would work for them again. management sucks and all they do is scream at you for nothing. learned many things with them"
good,Worked part-time for Quality Control as a Documentation Specialist. Participated in getting company approved for ISO-9000. Internal auditor and staff safety training were also part of my job.  Enjoyed the job.  Too bad new CFO made staff cuts to reduce expenses.
good,"I loved working for Walmart! I worked there for a year and the job was wonderful other than having to lift super heavy pallets it was a good job and I really enjoyed it. Sadly I had to leave due to medical issues but I would go back if I could, meaning if they would rehire me here in Idaho that would be great. The management I thought was really good and yeah there is always that one person thats a jerk but they have a good management team."
good,"I basically learned how to operate a cash register, and make sure I practice great customer service. I am a people person and I always like to make people laugh. I feel it makes the day go by faster when you try to have a little fun at work while doing a good job. The hardest part is the customers aren't always that friendly which makes the day stressful. The most enjoyable part is the great people I got to work with."
good,"I enjoyed the overall work environment. They pay was not enough, but being fresh out of high school i enjoyed it. I did promote from cashier, to a Customer Service Manager"
good,"easy job overall nice workers, management was good and customers were nice. lines would get long and we lacked in cashiers at times."
good,"Average workday was pretty typical, help customers, sever food from hot case, keep work place clean. When closing was pretty standard, wash dishes weight out expired food, sanitize work areas and close up."
good,having a short meeting tasking in and putting stock away in timely fashion. i learned that working nights was not to bad. and working fast was key for me there. management was able gather us up get things organized and put away. my coworkers and i all had are own tasks to complete and when we were done able help ones that werent. hardest part was working overnight for me. is that time always went by fast and i got a letter of recognition.
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart would be continuously moving yet confined to the register. I learned most of my customer service right there at the register. I loved most of the people I worked with, including management. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the general public. What I enjoyed about the job was the sorting and organizing of the money in the drawer. I also liked keeping my work area clean when possible (between customers)."
good,Waymart was a productive place to work it was interesting to work there and fun with the interesting peon-plea you see on the night shift
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with the company, having worked for them on two separate occasions, and would go back again if given the opportunity in the back offices."
good,I really enjoyed working here in the sense of being able to create a new family in my co-workers. I didn't really enjoy the fact that you're only given three days in half a year to take off. I also didn't agree with some people in management who couldn't budget times of breaks given. Some would get breaks earlier than others and at other times there were no breaks given. I did enjoy just being able to see my friends and co-workers
good,Good working environment. Positive employee experience with other employee and with costumers. Sales Associates worked as a team to accomplish set goals by managers.
good,I developed the ability to meet quota in a very fast environment but the work was very monotonous. The management there was very sloppy but the managers were quite friendly same with the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was at the beginning trying to meet quota and learn the organization system at a fast pace. for the last part the most enjoyable part of the job I suppose the decent salary and going home at the end of the day.
good,"Bela empresa, com boas oportunidades de efetivação, salário de R$ 1075,00 com carga horaria das 6 as 14;20 da tarde, segunda a sábado."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, the job was over all fun and satisfying. I loved working with the customers and helping them anyway i could. I typically enjoyed busy days, cashing out customers was fun. Bagging items quickly but organized. The best part of the day was getting to see different faces and working with other cashiers i enjoyed working with."
good,I unloaded trucks as an ICS associate and I loved it. Other employees would not help me lift a huge trash can which I then dropped on my foot which made me not able to work.
good,"Walmart is very flexible when it comes to balancing school or life schedules with work and are very understanding when unexpected personal situations arise. My coworkers were often in a good mood and we worked together happily and helped each other out when one was in need. "
good,typical day was routine. most manager were friendly and professional. co-workers were friendly and helpful. going to work everyday was enjoyable for me.
good,"Working at Walmart can either be one of the best jobs or one of the worst depending on your work ethic. If you like to stay busy and do you job as well as help customers then you will love it. However, you need to be thick skinned because not only will the managers be hard on you so will the customers. You should expect to be cussed out at least once while working for Walmart."
good,"A typical day would be an 8 hours shift, a decent lunch break, and 2 fifteen minute breaks. The job was actually a good one."
good,My work day consist of pre-screening patients before placing them in the doctor's office. Offering assistance when patients come out of  doctor's office. Helping the patients choose the right eye wear. I book appointments throughout the day. I stock and organize Vision Center merchandise. I work with a wonderful group of employees that work as one. I don't have a hard part of my job because I love what I do and I enjoy servicing our patients with the best customer service.
good,overall the experiance at vxi wasnt very good the management was bad no job security and very one was in very ones elses busniess
good,"learned to be speedy at entering numbers on the computer, observant to what was in the baskets as well as the people, and friendly to one and all no matter race, disability, religion etc."
good,"Some days can be better than others, but a challenge is what makes it more interesting. Wal-mart can be a very fast pace environment. Customers are always first. Wal-mart has great management teams that work as a team. I enjoy going to work every day because my co workers are like family."
good,"You meet a lot of new people as a cashier. Most people in Winchester are very nice and likeable. The customer service managers are very nice and patient with new trainees. The hardest part is having to be on your feet for long periods of time, but at least you get an entire hour for lunch to rest."
good,"work hard"
good,Typical day at walmat is unloading trucks and stalking shelves mark downs on countless items. Helping customers with their questions.
good,"They don't allow over-time so you will need a second job to survive, and their benefits are not beneficial. However for the pay the workplace is not exceedingly difficult. Co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. Management is personable and take employee concerns seriously. I did not hate being employed there."
good,"Hours stay consistent as long as you show productivity.  If you are an hard worker, you will not be bored.  Pay is okay for blue-collar standards or an college freshman, but try to move up if you plan on making more money in the company."
good,"My job as a photographer here was amazing, i really enjoyed it. It's a deep passion of mine, so I am honoured I got to pursue it for a little while. The staff and management is very snarky, rude, unprofessional, and not understanding whatsoever. They did not train me and then made me close the store, then laughed the next day when I arrived because I had made so many mistakes. Manager there watched cameras at home while you work."
good,A day at walmart is okay to have something to do during the day to meet up and see co-worker/friend and get a laugh if you need it... i learn the safety hazels and how alot of stuff can happen when people not playing attention to their children in the store .
good,"Great employer, great people.  Then benefits could have been better. They do a lot of things with the local community that each distribution center is located in.  They pay the hourly associates well for the work that they complete.  The hours are not always guaranteed."
good,"All of my co-workers were great. We would to try to make our day great but at the same time get the job done. I and others did not care to much for some of the meetings that we would have that would involve other departments but nothing to do with us cause it took out of our time to get our work done."
good,"Maintain a positive and excellent shopping and working experience for all customers and employees. Ensure podium for managers were balance throughout the day, and all registers and self check out were functioning to avoid long lines. Delegate cashiers to appropriate terminal. Check the store for cleanliness and make sure everything is in place to open the store. In this job I learned how to communicate and delegate wisely. Management were very nice and supportive.  Co-workers were friendly and we all get along well. The hardest part of this job is when you don't have enough coverage because of call outs. The most enjoyable part of this job is you get to meet different  people everyday and help them with whatever they need."
good,i worked a many Walmart stores in several states and i have to say they are all about the same. If you work hard you will get promoted and quickly.
good,Hardest part of this job would be the balance between the day and nigh as well as the amount of work and physical activity required. Typical day would be arriving and stocking through out the night. I learned how to become more fast pace and how to pay more attention to detail.The most enjoyable part would be the individual working and none crowded environment.
good,"A very easy job, and made lots of friends working here. Good pay and benefits for this position. Some of the management was kind of rude. The only annoying part was that I was under 18 when I worked there and there was a lot of restrictions. Other than that it was an okay job."
good,"Nice place to work with which has just open in Hillsboro."
good,"work freight, paperwork, price changes, negative on hands, customer service, resetting modulars,fun work atmosphere. Would go back to work the company."
good,Walmart is not all that they advertise. Working retail is not fun because you never get to spend any holidays with your family.
good,"The front end associates are the last employees customers speak with and it is important that they leave the store in a positive frame of mind. I liked working with my staff and talking and helping customers."
good,"A typical day was take care of whatever was left over from morning shift and then continued to my own duties."
good,"Much was required out of me not just for my job but vacant positions that I filled."
good,"working with cars helped me learned a lot and grow as a person, it was a great team work but the management was very poor where I got to the point of doing 3 persons' job at the same time."
good,"easy work you see new faces everyday its a great environment"
good,"Everyday I would arrive to work and know almost exactly what was expected to be done. While working on IMS my supervisor was absolutely fantastic. Down to earth, gave reasonable goals and made work enjoyable. I learned how to track inventory, binning, picking, stocking freight, how to unload a truck, stack pallets, move pallets with a pallet jack, electric pallet jack, walkie stacker and sit-down forklift. Most co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job would have been the constant change in the way work would be done, but it's better for a company to try to adjust to maintain the proper work flow than to sit idly aside and fall behind. My most enjoyable part of working for Walmart would have to be my experiences even with the most difficult customers. It taught me patience and acceptance. The worst part of the job was constantly being tossed between full-time and part-time status. I personally was placed on full-time status which is the only way to receive benefits. Shortly after, the company pulled hours and after averaging out the quarter, all of my benefits were pulled. This happened to SEVERAL employees multiple times. Getting a full-time position and keeping it was almost impossible. The most I ever made while working for Walmart was $13,000 in a year."
good,Staff was fun to work with. They are understanding and easy to work with. The benefits where actually beneficial. overall great experience and good pay as well for a cashier.
good,"Cashiering,helping customers, putting away returns,cleaning and fixing shelves. resetting shelves and end-caps. showing customers where things are."
good,"Started as a photo-lab tech who advanced to a photo-lab specialist, side trained in electronics. then ended in pharmacy."
good,"Typical retail store. Experience is what you make of it, and can depend on who you work with/for. Always very flexible with scheduling needs for schooling."
good,customer service and satisfaction is the number one goal and and the work environment is great but i personally didnt like that the company based our available hours to work each week on the sales from the previous year .
good,"this job wasn't always easy as i had to run all over the place to help costumers as well as working in different departments to help out. as a walmart employee i got to learn a lot about other job titles, and the growing of the company"
good,"I started working at walmart on a whim, i needed a job having been out of work for a month or so and so i applied, not taking it to seriously at the time. I got called the next day. I had an interview the same week. "
good,Walmart works very well with school hours and has good benefits for people looking to climb the \Walmart chain. the work isnt to hard and usually work with good people.
good,"Walmart has been good to me for the most part. As long as you mind your business, do your job and do not call out on a continual basis, you are good."
good,"Organize, Prep, Cook, Clean, Friendly Customer Service, Slice and Serve food items, Package food items, Work Well with other associates. "
good,A typical day at Walmart is a busy day with plenty to do. There is always something to new to learn and plenty of work to do. You learn everything from the cash register to the computer system used by Walmart. Management pushes very hard to keep the store in good shape but they are very mean to the workers. I have seen managers curse out the employees and the employees will go right back at the managers. The breaks are very good and are about every two hours making the shift fly right by. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with customers for parts of the shift and also being able to work alone doing backroom work. Overall Walmart had a good balance of everything.
good,"Working against the clock"
good,"The job is good and the environment is great, a little stressful here and there. I learned spanish working here. Its fast paced all day so you need to multitask."
good,"friendly environment to work in, no pressure. however, pay was little less and looking at the work it was alright. management was good, nice and friendly managers"
good,"Worked part time as a sales associate in the fresh area, mainly in the meat department."
good,"Pay is good. Always an ever changing schedule though. I was only a cashier, so I didn't get much experience in other departments. CSM's did their best with they had."
good,"While working at Walmart, I learned a lot of life skills, and worked with a lot of great people and leadership. Yes, I worked long hours, but the job benefits were great."
good,"Wal Mart offers great benefits, and great employees, customers. The management team was really good. Hardest part of job was unloading trucks in 100 degree heat."
good,"working for Wal-Mart tle as a first job in automotive industry was a good foot in the door. Manager was really reliable ,always was fair to each worker no matter what. It was a stepping stone to all my learning towards vehicles and where I learn to drive Manuel transmission."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a great experience giving the fact it was my first job, lessons that I learned was very helpful & beneficial."
good,"No Walmart aprendi muito, como pessoas e como profissional."
good,Really easy work for a decent amount of cash. Management sucks and is pretty demanding but they usually aren't around when you are doing your job to their expectations. 1 hour lunch along with 2 15 minute breaks.
good,Walmart is basically about working hard and also helping customers and having good customer service i learned a lot about Walmart the most enjoyable  part about working there was helping customers find what they were looking for.
good,Loved helping associates with daily tasks and training associates proper job functions and great customer service.The customer should be number one and I go above and beyond to help my customers because that's what I love to do.
good,"I start my shift at 11pm with a start-up meeting for the stores current events, I assess the daily tasks to be done as each one varies. I have learned many new things in the retail sector on how a business copes and handle issues that arise. My manager is very supportive of me and the work needs to achieve my end goals. The hardest part of the job is when we are short staffed the job gets more stressful as less man power but still able to complete the task by shift end. My favorite part of my job is knowing the store is clean & ready when customers come in. I work with a good team of people that coordinate the tasks efficiently."
good,"I run cash register everyday and help the employees to the fullest of my extent and if I can not help them, then I get a member of management to give them the help they need."
good,"Walmart offers a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement. Company is a high volume,quick changing environment with endless potential for learning. Customer expect to be satisfied, associates and management do their best to assist."
good,"Very lively up beat place to work at all times. I learned multiple hands on skills and the ins and outs of numerous departments. Management takes there time to make sure you feel very comfortable, and you make a good fit in the work place. Co-workers are very helpful most of the time, and does make the job easier for everyone instead a ton of work piled to one person. The hardest part of the job in my opinion, would be making sure nothing is left undone, when at times the store could have a influx of items from time to time depending on the season. The most enjoyable part of the day on my behalf, will have to be leaving to go home, knowing you did as much work possible, with the store being ready to open the doors for customers and hoping i was much of helping hand (Such a good feeling)."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. I helped customers when they needed help and rung them up on the cashier so they wouldn't have to walk to the front of the establishment. I may go back to Walmart one day.
good,Company offers some room for professional growth. However to make employment here worthwhile you need a plan to move up into management or to a high paying position not found in store locations.
good,"Co workers are great, if we keep them. The retention rate is very low (2 original workers left and been open for one year) minus management."
good,"I was a cashier for Wal*Mart. I did like this job quite a bit, you do the same thing everyday- most days- (working the register) but it's fun because you get to see different people all the time. I did occasionally stock the shelves with the items people returned to the customer service desk - you come across some interesting things on the shelves if you actually looking."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of throwing boxes on to trailers for 11 hours straight, the job was very physically demanding and at the time was not under very good management."
good,A good place to work and I enjoy working with others. I like a place where people listen to me and work with me by helping me out when I ask them to. The management just needs improvement and better communication is needed.
good,I think Walmart is a great place to work for advancement. They tend to advance from within when possible. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who call off or who only show up for the paycheck. I enjoy interacting with the customers.
good,"Its easy fun, I work at a fast paste so I tend to get my stuff done to soon. They stick me in different departments to keep me busy and help out others."
good,"Job satisfaction comes from assigned store and management assigned to the store.  Overall a very good experience, great potential to advance through hard work and knowledge of retail operations."
good,had fun working there because that was my first job and it taught me a lot about the world an how to handle customer's an that people there are very fast and have to be able to adapt to what's happing around you so that way you could stay ahead
good,"I had wonderful benefits, amazing work-family, fantastic boss. The benefits were great, my insurance was affordable and had good coverage. The management outside of pharmacy was poor and the customers were arrogant and uncooperative. But the customers were  more understandable and much more easy to deal with than the new manager they hired. I loved getting to know customers on a personal level and have nice short conversations with them. I enjoy brightening any ones day that i can."
good,"I mainly was just stocking items, so it was a pretty laid back job. The only difficulty would be the overnight hours for me."
good,"Very fast paced, friendships with associates and customers.  Learned how to order, stock, schedule and customer service."
good,"Very fast-paced work environment."
good,"This company is vast with plenty of room for advancement and great opportunities. The work environment is one of a fast paced, high volume, retailer which allows you to learn a lot about how to run a successful business."
good,great people to work with the company overall is great but it has it not so great moments as all companies do. Great advancement and some great managers who will help along the way
good,"Une journée de travail c bien et j'ai beaucoup appris,La plus difficile dans une job c de pas finir se que tu as commencer.La plus agréable chose c que a la fin de la journée sa montre que la job et bien fait et que les boss sont content."
good,"the place was ok, it was a job. the overall feel for the management was good, the co workers are good, and working with the customers was good as well."
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience.  The staff is very hard working and overall and good team spirit.  I learned that hard work pays off in a team environment, it is self satisfying and when your teams is part of this, you can't get better.  The hardest part of the job was that the schedules tend to change but overall, I think management worked with each of us to ensure a balance was achieved with respect to getting the job done but also a respect for us as individuals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that we had a respect for one another which really created a happy work environment.  It was nice to go to work each day."
good,Schedules are not very friendly with part time workers since their system is not that flexible.  Most of the Assistant Managers and CSM are not really concerned with customer service.
good,"job security for myself to sustain my family. Even though Im working in night shift, all I can say its enjoyable to work with my fellow associates."
good,My co-workers were very pleasant to work with and very helpful to one another. We worked very well together as a team and communicated quite well with one another. The hardest part of the job was always being short staffed to a brand new store that just opened. But with hard work and a game plan for working 2 departments with 3 people we always found a solution.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. They seem to look out for their associates .Educationl opportunities, 401 k program. Annual pay increases."
good,"I really liked working at Walmart. My co-workers were friendly and always willing to lend a hand if I needed help. Unfortunately, when classes picked up at the University of Oregon again I just was not capable of keeping the hours the gave me and doing well in class."
good,"I look forward going into work everyday greeting my associates and peers, I learn to not to be afraid to open to people by listening. managing frontend of store was very interesting."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for providing opportunities for career advancement, training, discounts and many other incentives."
good,They give you hours at their convenience. Along with coming back in 6 hours after getting off.  there is non set schedule and management is very unprofessional. they do have great benefits and if you are in the right department good hours are good too. cashiers happen to get the worst hours though. not enough to live on.
good,"Un lugar perfecto para trabajar, con el salario, y los beneficios."
good,"I liked working at Walmart on the night shift every night, it was not much interference with my work since there were very few customers."
good,"Fast paced, fun and challenging.  Coordinate backhaul deliveries in a timely manner for Wal Mart drivers while on the road throughout New England and New York"
good,I had a lot of fun being a cashier I got to meet new faces and do a lot for people I didn't think I could. Saving people money and helping them have a better day than when they came in. They came in mad and left happy being the last face they've seen I had to make them smile.
good,"I honestly believe WalMart (inside the store) is not for college graduates as far as advancement opportunities, unless you start off as an store/co/assistant manager. However different stores managers may allow better advancement opportunities for college graduates. Great company to work for as far as corporate opportunities and firm in stability"
good,"I like Walmart. It's nothing exciting, but working there has helped me accomplish my goals. In general it's a pretty relaxed job and there's always opportunities for extra shifts."
good,it is very good experience. all co-worker is so friendly and helpful. the manager sometime is so rude. the most enjoyable part of the job is to meet lot of people. sometime they prefer for me a job!
good,It was a very unprofessional workplace but i dealt with it because i loved the job i was doing and i stay motivated at all times.
good,"Typically start the day filling orders and taking orders. Management was decent, except wanted everyone else to do their job. Some co-workers would lend a helping hand while others wouldn't do anything. Hardest part of the job would be having to clean up after everyone else because they were too lazy or didn't think it was part of their job. Most enjoyable part was new experiences such as decorating cakes and helping with bread and donuts."
good,"Very friendly work place, I enjoyed my time there. Very understanding management, usually gave out free snacks in the break room."
good,"I was a sales associate working in the deli. I learned how to slice meats and cheeses for customers. Also learned how to operate a scale. Did general housekeeping, dishes, and stocked merchandise. I loved 99% of the people that worked there and actually became very good friends outside of work. I was awarded Pop-Star of the Month because of my excellent customer service and friendly attitude towards all customers. The hardest part of the job was learning what numbers to put into the scale to label merchandise for customers, but once I got the hang of it, the job was very easy. The only reason I left is because of the lack of help I was receiving during my shifts."
good,It was a good job to work at and was consistent. I got along with my co-workers and I actually enjoyed working here. I give it a all around thumbs up.
good,"Working at the Wal-Mart customer service desk I worked with customers one-on-one. My co-workers would help me out at the desk if we started to get busy, for example on Fridays when everyone was coming in to cash their paychecks. The hardest part of my job was that managers were never on the same page as each other and it ended up making many things during my shift unorganized, for example who was covering me lunch break."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart, everything had a good environment. I would gladly work at Wal-Mart again. My experience was good, fun, and made me a better person. The management I had was good and my co-workers were good people. I really had no hard jobs that I obtained."
good,The job was simple enough. Co-workers were pleasant to work with. Management was kind but distant. Good job for part-time and temporary employment; I would not want to spend years there
good,"Empresa que paga bem, sabe reconhecer funcionário, muitos benefícios, só era ruim pois viajava muito,e não tinha horário para voltar."
good,"Sometimes over abuse employees, making them work hours beyond scheduled hours without previous notice. Management is not trained as to what individual jobs consist of. Creates very stressful work environment and not very safety conscious. Good work environment during off seasons.  incentives were awesome, but not consistent."
good,"-repetitive tasks, bagging products"
good,"busy always, learned a lot about safety, management could be good or bad depending on how you treated them. co-workers were all so supportive and helpful. The hardest part of the job I was doing was I wasn't physically fit enough to lift some of the stuff we had to lift. I loved breaks with my coworkers because we would just sit there and talk and laugh."
good,"to check inventory control,schedule,hire and fire,cus.service ,vendor ordering and scheduling meetings,special ordering for certain cus who needed a large quanity of goods such as daycares,schools,etc."
good,"fast paced , well managed . stead hours which balances a nice work week . would recommend  walamart dc to someone searching for anyone who isn't much of a people person ."
good,Good and learning experiment. They dont give you many hours and hard to support a family. They tell you they will give you the hours then dont.
good,"this is an excellent place to work for many people, the others associates are friendly and it's a god environment."
good,"Most days is was not bad then you would get a day when every customer had a complaint about how the store was ran.  Most of the co-workers where great, so of them thought that they where better then you."
good,my typical day at work dealt with working with customers to make sure they were happy and  making sure the product is up to date and stocked properly and efficiently.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. You never get bored there is always something to learn and people to help. The management team is very knowledgeable.
good,"Great Job, Stocking sales floor, Pulling items no longer that are good, a lot of people that are easy to get along with, great management."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. The co-workers were friendly and we all worked together. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling. I really enjoyed communicating with the customers.
good,Overall a good experience working with good people towards daily pressures and demands. A great opportunity dealing with public and providing a great shopping experience.
good,"I had a good day at work"
good,"A typical day at work included monitoring of all devices within the Data Centre, including the cooling and electrical system."
good,"When starting with this company I was a cashier and I would check customers out with their groceries.  After a couple of months I moved up to Customer Service Manager.  At that time I had to handle customer complaints, employee complaints, close registers and pull reports."
good,Wal-mart is a great place to work and offers you a chance to be promoted. They have excellent benefits for employees and they match your 401K. They days are always different so you have challenges that differ from day to day. This eliminates the employees from getting bored with the day to day activities.
good,"Great place to work with if you are looking for a minimum wage job. They don't pay very much and don't offer much lee-way but if you are just looking for a job where you can perform your set duties, than It's fine. Sometimes they will have you cross-trained and pull you from department to department, and occasionally they are understaffed but that is not up to management so I can't blame them for that. You will always have a few really bad managers but overall, everyone tries to work with you more or less. You might get lucky and find really friendly one which I have, but I have also gotten into my fair share of arguments with the bad ones. Good thing is, bad ones don't stay very long."
good,empresa oferece muito crescimento profissional; tem cultura que e seguido tanto a cliente como ha associados
good,"On a typical day at Wal-Mart I would start my shift at 10:00pm. I would first go to a team meeting that we would attend every night. After the meeting was over, I would go to my assigned work area. I would usually get there around 10:15. I would begin my shift by staging my product, and loading it into a cart. I would then stock the shelves with the product I had loaded. After that was finished I was finished stocking one isle I would move to the next. I was responsible for two to three isles in a night. There were nights that I would do extra departments if management needed extra help. I enjoyed the job I was given at Wal-Mart, and it was never a problem to handle the work load. Sometimes management was hard to get along with, but I learned how to become a more professional employee by working with them."
good,"Walmart is awesome, I mean they have everything you could want or need. Working there is great too, they really do keep you busy. Very fast paced job and you get to meet so many interesting people. I learned more about customer service here than anywhere else. Everyone gets a chance to advance and management makes sure of that. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep everyone happy and the most enjoyable part is helping a lost customer find what they need. That "" Thank you so much"" really brightens up your day."
good,"application is the most important and i got it. made many good friends. working in Walmart is very good. Inventory management was very hard to because we need to carry heavy load so due to that my back was hurt those days . i n Walmart i learn to drive amny inventory machine like pick machine , etc"
good,sweeping floor & scrubbing floor with scrubber./how get along with people better./management was fair./co-workers was very helpful when need./to me getting to work./having a successful night
good,"A typical at work would require greeting every customer and directing them to the cash register. Resolving any customer concerns in a timely and friendly manner was common practice. Co-workers, generally, were friendly and sociable individuals. Strong relations with management."
good,"Supervised 20 associates-No-glare "
good,"Empresa com uma cultura diferente, que da voz ao empregado,"
good,"I get to work and have some tasks to do. ive learned a lot how to be a manager, inventory, unload trucks, stock, run register, provide excellent customer service, etc. Management at Wal-Mart are okay i feel like they could get better or i should have a chance to prove myself. most co-workers are good some are not and i feel like the ones that do not do so well get a better opportunity than i do when i work hard for what i do. Hardest part of my job is coming in and working my butt off to try to move up and it doesnt mean a lot to anyone and i wear myself out. Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that the customers leave with satisfaction of our store and the products they purchase."
good,"The people at walmart were very supportive."
good,Getting the job complete moving to the next learning an knowing you could advance in you're career with many learning capabilities
good,There was always something to do. I enjoyed working with the people and helping them find the right product. My co workers were great to work with and I enjoyed it .
good,"need to improve on cleanliness, management does a good job in communicating with the employees and customers. Co-workers need to be respectable to the customers hardest part is dealing with angry customer, Seeing new items coming into the store"
good,"always busy but great leadership"
good,"Productivity comes with punctuality, efficiency and enthusiasm in role as cashier. Accuracy is paramount. Cheerful approach towards customers."
good,Walmart is a great company that truly thinks about the customer in every meeting at the home office where I work. Political correctness can go over board. Mid-level managers are great and engaged. Upper level management seems so busy and detached from daily happenings that they say one thing at a meeting and turn around and talk out of the other side of their mouth at a meeting a week later. It can be hard to keep up and gauge the asks of upper management.
good,"I worked there for 6 years, and it was mostly pleasant. Job got repetitive after 6 years but most the managers were great and same with the coworkers. Great job for high school student or college student, but not long term."
good,"I started out as a cashier, which was my first job. I was a good customer service rep. I was always smiling and making others smile and happy, I was also fast at checkout and always helped customers if it was needed. After about 7 months I think, I then became an unloader. I was to unload trucks with a few others and organize them on pallets or L-carts. We would then take the pallets and L-carts out on the floor and to the areas of where those products belong so that the 3rd shift crew would stock as much as they could. There was heavy lifting required, messy spills to clean up and lots of cleanup involved. The team was then named IMS after about 2 months and we were to control inventory counts and locations in the back room of the store. If the Telezon said that the item was able to be stocked on the floor we had to pick that from its location and send it out to be stock and anything that could not be stocked we had to find a place to put it and enter it in on the system. Working I learned that customers are number 1, they always come first. The store I worked out was a small place and everyone that work there knew each other, therefor, there was a lot of confusion between a lot of people there. The best part about working there was the physical labor that I endured. I loved the physical ability that I had there."
good,"unload the freight truck into stock shelves, walk down the walls and check the dates, after removing out of dates and doing mark downs, you restock the shelves for customers, make sure to make a list of all items not in stock for wall so that they can be ordered for the next days truck."
good,Walmart was a place to work. Amazing people! Friendly customers. The hardest part was just dealing with things that were out of your control. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers.
good,"middle to low paying jobs , good management most are by the book and treat employees fairly , the only problem I had with this company is the limited hours  one week I would have a full  40 hours and the next week 15 hours  was hard to get on full time ."
good,"Once I clock into my shift my manager directs me to where I will be assigned to that day. I usually unloaded boxes and stock the shelves with the new products. In addition, I would have customers come up to me with questions. I would promptly answered their questions and then continued with my assigned work. I enjoyed it very much. Everything was fast paste. I loved to help others in need."
good,"enjoy working with customers and work associates"
good,it was the best place I have ever worked for. The people I worked with and the mangers were so fun to be working with.The hardest part of the days was trying to keep the times down. The enjoyable part of the day was getting to talk and know the custmours.
good,"Management was hard and unfair, and due to their actions most employers left finding new jobs. I personally loved working for Wal-Mart, but the front end management thought he knew everything and did not. If he would had learnt to treat people like humans instead of dogs, a lot of hard working people would still be there."
good,Get to meet a lot of different people. Learn new ideas and products weekly. Family environment. Works with your availability. Training available.
good,"Good job, nothing to complain about. there was an issue with management and there was a lot of in work drama but that is pretty normal"
good,"Fun, fast paced ever changing and challenging place to work. Get to meet all kinds of people and work as a team with fellow associates. Each section of employees working their areas and willing to help out in other departments even if they weren't real familiar w that area but all work to achieve one goal and to provide the customer w products on the shelves and brought to sales floor.  Providing good customer service and getting the customer through the check out line in an accurate and timely fashion.  Best part of working there is making lifetime friendships and relationships w customers who you see each week  Sometimes, the scheduling can be challenging because of working late nights and be back in next morning within small amount of hours off-back to back shifts we call them."
good,Great place to work if you like working with people. Very demanding during the busy periods and requires you think act promptly. Upper management was decent; supervisors were good for the most part until difficult customers came along..then professionalism was minimized.
good,Most of the management in the store is pretty good there is always at least one in every company that just is not up to par but that is to be expected. all of the co-workers are good people. Generous and good work atmosphere. What i enjoy best is probably when you get the one understanding customer who sees how hard you work and they wish you the best day possible. The roughest part is probably the call out policy sometimes emergencies happen and only being granted 6 a year before getting fired is harsh.
good,"Empresa muito focada na redução de custos."
good,"I enjoy working at Wal-Mart. I live very close so that's a bonus. I've made lots of friends and that makes the work day go by faster. The work itself isn't bad, not a lot of down time, management is helpful. My only real complaints are that I wish the pay was a little more and I would like to have set hours instead of 11-8 one day and 10-7 the next then 1-10 after that and I myself like set hours."
good,A typical work day consisted of making sure the Men's Department looked neat and presentable. Every 30 minutes I'd check for go backs and replenish the racks.
good,"Certain managers were very disrespectful not only towards me put also the customers. Getting along with other co-workers was very fun , startimg this job they would often help me understand certain things ."
good,a fun work place where you get to be you. the management was very supportive and encouraging. the hours where decent and the pay was good. I enjoyed helping the customers.
good,"The management team at our store is efficient and enthusiastic. It is great to work at a store that is all about making the customer happy! knowing the ins and outs of returns, money services and the registers is a must. Unfortunately, everyone has bad days and sometimes that shows in the attitudes of customers and employees. When that happens it's time to break out the wonderful people skills developed over the years and hopefully turn someones bad day into a great day."
good,"great benefits. hr associates gossip to much. management could use more work. if you work hard, easy to move up. its what you make it to be"
good,Mon experience au sein de cette entreprise ma enseignée le travail d'équipe
good,I overall though it was a good place to work management wasn't bad and it's a good place to work over the weekend while going to school.
good,"Working with customers is an awesome experience, however the market manager could be more respectful.  Awesome environment to grow management experience."
good,"Cleaning registers daily and sweeping the work area between customers. Learned to handle different customer situations while working on register, also at the Customer Service Desk. Enjoyed working with management, and co-workers."
good,during my time at walmart it was very memorable. I can remember  days it would be slow and boring. than back door and be quick and very live. not just off from just earning a check but for just helping others aorund me and the customers.
good,"A nice place to work. Every day is different, but steady. People are friendly to work with. management was ok breaks are a little short, but ok"
good,"As a people person, I enjoyed working with customers and helping the patients with their eyecare needs. Friendly co-workers are like part of fmily"
good,"i learn lot of things such as how to handle pressure,multitasking,customer service from walmart. my co-worker was like my family member and i am very grateful to the management."
good,This is not the company to work for. The management doesn't know what exactly goes on in their store. They don't know how to treat their associate and do not even appreciate them
good,"Es un muy buena empresa, en cuestion de capacitacion y ambiente laboral, lamentablemente, el tabulador de sueldos es muy bajo"
good,"After clocking in, I report to the Receiving Room located at the back of Walmart, and I check for any trash or product that's not in its correct location and place it where it needs to be. shortly after I'm usually in the RR (Receiving Room) pricing product, making count of how much Walmart has of that product, how much more we need to meet customer's standards, and much more. I also unload shipments that come on Walmart sponsored trucks or other parties( Great Dane, FedEx,etc.) I've learned how to play a key role in team work, providing a positive influence on my co-workers that I mentor, and I also learned the value of keeping customers first no matter what. The most enjoyable part of this job is the meetings where everyone speaks to one another, with warm smiles and we share how our day is going."
good,"Great people to work with.  I found management in some areas lacking communication.  No benefits for part time employees, and sometimes they reduce hours, even after they hire many new employees.  Not many postings internally for advancement."
good,"pushing carts is how it sounds its not the funniest job neither does it pay well its something for a kid in high school like i  was at the time the hardest part of the job is working when there is ice and snow completely covering the parking lot, my management was great for the job the take great care of you,"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. The culture is strong. Large Company that requires good networking to see the different parts of it and how the parts equal the whole. Co-workers understood importance of customer service. Enjoyed the variety of work. Never a dull day.
good,"I started as a cashier in 2009, and told myself I would move up to a supervisor within the first six months. When management heard of my plans, they offered me the chance, after only two weeks. I continued to climb and eventually made it all the way to a salaried management position within my first 5 years."
good,"As my resume stated, I currently work in the meat department and i am able to use my skill in everyday interaction with customers."
good,Work was rewarding and generally fun. I enjoyed interacting with customers and was especially pleased when I was able to help customers find the items they were looking for.  My department managers were all supportive and easy to work with.  I enjoyed my co-workers and felt they were all easy to work with.
good,The work load itself is very minimal compared to other jobs I had. its a very diverse company. But not understanding towards home life and management looks at associates as a whole unit and misses the individual. But benefits are good.
good,"Very fast paced job with a super management team and lots of opportunities for advancement. My attitude determined the attitude of others,  so I always keep a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was getting employees to come to work."
good,You are able to to grow within the company. Some days are busier then others. The managers are very understanding as long as you talk to them. The hard part is the communication with co-workers.
good,"Fun working environment, fast paced, management very concerned with bottom line. "
good,enjoyed my work experience at wal-mart  good benefits and pay I would love to work at walmart again. good crew members and co workers
good,"My experience working at Wal Mart Supercenter was over all a great learning experience. A typical night at work for me would be unloading pallets from the truck, separating all the freight to be distributed into the correct aisles."
good,"The work ethic was good, you come in and get your assigned work for the night and you would just work. Team work was the big push nightly to help others when you were done with your work."
good,"El dia tipico en walmart es de trabajo constante, aprendi a gestionar mis prioridades, mi jefatura directa era una jefatura que se preocupaba por su equipo, mis colegas fueron un apoyo constante."
good,Its a great place to work. Things are constantly changing there. Rules and stuff to the sort. Don't get set on any of the rules except for the basics cause they could change at any moment. Management are good people that try their best to look out for you and your fellow coworkers. Most managers were employees at some point so they have a sense of understanding as well.
good,This is a great place to start a career in customer service. Walmart is a great place to learn the structure of Corporate America in relation to the consumer.
good,"Working at Walmart to me was a fun job i got to meet new people everyday and provide customer service to those in my community. I had learned patience when dealing with some people and a proficient way of dealing with money, management is always close by to help their employees when in need. The hardest part of this job was staying caught up when in a rush hour or during the holidays."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, colaboradores prestativos,"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was an interesting experience. It taught me a lot of different things. I learned how to manage different departments. I learned how to handle people from different walks of life and religions. It opened me up to the world itself by showing me that people don't think how I would think. It also taught me that if the wrong person is given the position to be in power, they will not know how to lead the people they are responsible for. I also learned that things happen that you won't be prepared for, but as long as you keep a positive attitude then things will change for the better."
good,"As the first full time job in USA, Walmart provides me a lot of opportunities to lear, practice, and apply knowledge and skill in daily business. I have a very diversity team, people are from all over the world. It is a good place to interact with people who from different places and have different background."
good,"Work stays at a steady to fast paced rate to keep the store stocked, neat and clean. Enjoyed working with many of the other employees."
good,"Great place to work and customers were always great! "
good,"A typical day would basically have started by I would have to go and get lawn and garden keys to open lawn and garden doors. But management most of the time wouldn't have the keys where they were suppose to be so we had to wait until another member of management got them from front office. Then I would be multitasking by working register and working on getting inventory out."
good,"Worked very hard to keep customers happy by filling their prescriptions as a team member.  We took pride in making sure that the customer was our number one priority.  Management always was part of this team.  The day would start with a customer dropping off a prescription whether it be a new one or a refill.  it would then go from drop off to input, then to the pharmacist then back to fill.  It would then go to the cashier to ring that customer out.  it was all done within 20 minutes or so (at least we tried)."
good,Management had flexible working hours and always appreciated everything I did. This job helped me work better in even the most frustrating situations. The hardest part of the job was expressing the need for more hours.
good,Management had their issues. My co-workers we a blast to work with. They made working there easier. The hardest part was making sure  we got our tasks done on time. (Tasks were off my timing sometimes)
good,Working at walmart is like having another family everyone is cool. When you have a lot of pallets to stock thats the hardest part but it still gets done. My co-workers taught me a lot when i was working there.
good,"Easy jobs, management wasn't friendly but it was ok i worked over night to get the extra money they pay but i already had a full time day job i was just very tired that is the only reason i left"
good,"Greeted by management prior to start of shift. Giving a layout of work in order of importance to be completed by the end of shift. the hardest part of the job is seasonal. The holidays are always very busy and customers tend to get over excited and the store is messed up. The most enjoyable part is executing projects and meeting store goals, as well as assisting customers with their needs."
good,"Open 24/7 363 days a year. Work demands are high, often trying to deal with unrealistic expectations from managers. Employer is people friendly, giving customers and workers a pleasant environment to grow and shop."
good,"Working for Walmart, I learned how to manage my attitude when it came to rude customers.It made my job easier being able to provide information for my customers."
good,"It is a great place to work. Must co-workers are great people to talk to and rely upon when you are in need of help. Management is that bad, but it could improve. Scheduling is bad unless you like random schedules."
good,"A typical day at Walmart could be good or bad, sometimes the lines are crazy long. I have learned a lot of math skills and how to communicate with customers. My co workers are great and we all get along with each other. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the long line ups that never seem to end due to low staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing happy customers, and knowing that i got the job done how they wanted me to."
good,I think the hardest part for working for wal mart is when you have managers that's there and don't do anything. im either on the register or on the floor stocking im never in one place. I learned how to just enjoy my day and be nice to everyone even if there wrong.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart as a Cake Decorator. The management was very good and very organized. The pay was also very reasonable but no advancements or benefits till 1 year of working there.
good,"Wal-mart is a very social environment, I really enjoyed working with the other employees. The customers are understanding for the most part, nothing to difficult to deal with.there are just so many people coming through there, it tends to be a busy place at times. I do believe that the job is not for everyone and it takes the right kind of person to manage with so many different people moving in and out all day. For the most part the job is a decent place to be employed you just have to find your niche."
good,A typical day would be to run freight and assist customers.  I am learning about customer service and what goes on in an auto shop.  The managers at Walmart are quite helpful and knowledgful. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the cutomers.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers.
good,"Challenging work place, but always willing to face challenge head on.  The company always strive to ensure SAFETY comes first.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to award my associates for achieving area and company goals, helping them grow as leaders.  The hardest part of the job is completing heavy workloads without enough manpower, however, sometimes that comes with the territory."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for, its easy to move up, they like to advance people who already in. Didnt have a set schedule because of my position"
good,Overall very good job and competitive pay. The hours were reasonable and benefits were great. I was cashier there and i enjoyed it very much.
good,"Busy and productive job working with good people each night, even tho not always staffed fully we got our jobs done and took pride in this. I enjoyed working along side of my colleagues, we had fun while making sure we got our jobs done each night. There were many taske to complete each night and at times was stress filled but we learned how to cope and deal with these as time went on."
good,"Se realizan juntas de comunicación con todos los asociados, se comienza por recuperar los estandares de la tienda."
good,"I worked on the overnight maintenance floor crew with two other co-workers.my job duties consisted of stripping ,buffing and mopping floors overnight to ensure store was clean and in tip top condition by next day.Duties kept me busy throughout  the night, which I loved.I worked with a good crew.We all knew our responsibilities."
good,Days were easily done but with the not-up-to-date systems they often messed up or were hard to troubleshoot without a manager.
good,"As is typical for a Large, multi-national corporation, the local managers were very good, but the company rules and attitude were ambivalent towards the individual."
good,I was able to help customers feel better. great chance to use compassion and patience. Great opportunity for continued learning
good,"high attrition"
good,I would go in and start with making sure that everything was caught up with breaks and lunches and make sure that anything that management needed us to take care of for that day was getting done or was finished. I worked with a great team and we all made sure that the front end and even other parts of the store ran smoothly. The hardest part of my job was when you are the only css covering all breaks and lunches and being called to different parts of the store for assistance while you are still needed on the front end to take care of customers and associates up there. But the best part of my job was meeting all the new people and making connections with them as they are the reasons we all have jobs. They always have a story to tell and sometimes you may be the only person they actually talk to all day. I learned alot from working at walmart but they best thing was how to be a good team leader.
good,"Inexperienced Department Managers who are not familiar with Walmart, I want to learn more. Great place to grow. Customers and different departments."
good,"A typical day at work consist of tasking in to see which areas you have to work. After that, you start to break down your pallets. Time management is huge because you're on a set time for each task to be done. Management was okay. I had your typical co-workers. Some were hard working and others hardly working. They all were very helpful. Hardest part of the job is when you are understaffed and a have big truck load. So it makes the night be that much harder. The most enjoyable part of job was interacting with customers."
good,"Completing all forms of transactions (cash, debit/credit cards, gift cards, checks, WIC, etc.), greeted customers. answer customers questions and concerns"
good,It's a good place to work. Managers are very helpful. A good support group from upper management. Management expects excellence from every employee.
good,"Helping customers."
good,"Grande experiência profissional, onde a variedade de atividades e responsabilidades, interação com outras empresas e pessoas agregou muito em minha formação profissional"
good,"In my two years of working at Wal-Mart, I opened up and came out of my shell. I was a hands on worker, and it didn't take me long to catch on to something. I was cross-trained as a Cashier, Customer Service Desk Associate, Electronics Associate and Layaway Associate. It was like a family, everyone, for the most part, got along. Some members of management treated you fairly,  and I loved going to work everyday because of that. Some things need to be changed though!"
good,"High production factory work, management is under a lot of stress but employees stick together and get the work done."
good,A good place to work for to get a paycheck and to pickup valuable merchandising skills.  The ability to move around the store and pickup on different facets of merchandise managing can make your quite the on-par merchant.
good,"Company with unlimited opportunities.  You can change careers and never leave the Company.  The most rewarding part of my position is helping associates, management and customers understand the ""Why"" behind the answer.  Metrics are a huge part of measuring success."
good,"Aprendi sobretudo com  o corpo administrativo e gerencial a crescer como funcionário e pessoa em todos os segmentos de uma empresa onde deve haver total integração para crescimento mútuo, (empresa- funcionário)."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart part-time is great for people that need some extra income and a steady schedule, such as students. Work switches from slow to fast-paced depending on the day and season, so plan your schedule carefully if you are a student."
good,"It isn't so bad, at least in the pharmacy. I enjoyed this job a lot, and wished I had never left. I just wish that they would pay their employees more, I understand that the pharmacists went to school, but the techs did a majority of all the work done in the pharmacy."
good,"llegar revisar correos, contestar pendientes, revisar diariamente las horas laboradas por los trabajadores para que estos no realicen tiempo extra, en este trabajo adquiri conocimientos como Recursos Humanos y descubri que era lo que me gustaba hacer, trabajar ahi me dejo grandes compañeros uy7a que con todos trabaje muy bien, considero que nunca existio una parte dificil al contrario siempre era lago nuevo que aprender, lo que mas me gusto es su equipo de trabajo, ese compañerismo."
good,"I always worked from 5a.m.,till 1p.m., or 6a.m. till 3p.m. I would begin cleaning the area, removing any old, or out-of-date product. Start filling cooler, or shelves with new product. I have worked with produce. Always keeping it full, fresh & attractive for purchase.  Management always conducted morning meetings, & provided information , as needed. Co- workers were always good at working as a team. The hardest part of the job, i would have to say, was coming in after a shift, that did not do thrie part. The dept. would not be in good shape. The most enjoyable part, was getting it looking fresh & clean, & being proud of my work."
good,"A typical day consisted of taking out pallets from the pack room to the sales floor. Stocking the aisles with merchandise, changing prices. End of day, taking pallets back and cleaning out work space. Learned a lot about retail. Managements were OK. Employees were fun to work with. Hardest part about the job were politics and the most enjoyable part is there was plenty of work everyday."
good,It's a good place for people who are interested only in work. Nice co-workers and reporting managers. NIce employee discounts for full time employees.
good,"I liked working here because it was a fast moving job. I personally like to be organized and in this job I was able to. It was very tiring esp being overnight, but the time went by fast."
good,I meet all types of people needing all types of different things. some customers were easy to deal with some were not as easy but it taught me to adjust and be patient
good,Honestly the people I worked with made the night fly by and made working at Wal-Mart pretty fun actually. I had nights where it was insanely boring and over loaded with work but for the most part I had a great time there and the pay checks I really miss cause I knew I always had money in my bank and the job security was never a worry to me.
good,"good place to work but if you have open availability your hours are all over the place & at times it is a very hectic job, but i have made some really good lifelong friends with some of the other employees."
good,"Management pushes you to your limits in order to help you personally grow and develop new skills. Not the easiest place to move up in positions, but they give you the opportunity to develop management skills as you help fellow colleagues train in. A typical day at work was a 14 hour shift pushing yourself to complete all tasks given in a short period of time. I learned to work at a fast pace but still be accurate at what I needed to accomplish. Management helped me succeed at moving up in the work place, not as a full time manager, but to help out fellow management and get my experience in to move up when the position came available. My co-workers were easy to get along with and knew when the time to be friends and the time to work was. The hardest part of the job was the long shifts with few breaks in between."
good,I helped unload trucks that came in with a variety of merchandise. Then I would pull the pallets to the floor and down stack groceries.
good,"Checking in vendors, walking the floor to make sure it is safe for customers and associates to shop and work in. Some days seemed longer than others when you got done in your area you had to help other people."
good,"I worked for Walmart for about 8.5 years.  I started as an overnight stocker and after a couple of promotions, I became an assistant manager.  I liked many aspects of the job including being able to interact with customers and employees.  I also liked selling a lot of product during the day and being able to come in at night and basically rebuild everything.  Sometimes on extremely busy days the shelves would be quite empty and we would be able to put out enormous amounts of product, which would free up space in the backrooms, make our store look better, and make us ready for the next business day.  "
good,"Not a bad place to work. The people are enjoyable and hard working. The management isn't bad but at the time they kept swapping managers in and out. It is a big company so there is always going to be some problems that show up because of it, but overall it can be a fun place to work."
good,"A typical day for me, I'm constantly on the go weather it's helping a customer, merchandising my department, checking inventory making sure its correct and fill what needs to be."
good,"Good experience with my co-workers and a grater opportunity of growth in the customer service field. One thing, I don't agree with this job is that sometimes management wasn't  fair with some of the senior employees.But over all I enjoyed to work for them."
good,The over all workplace was a quite place with beneficial co-worker interaction. The manager had it in their heads that the things they told us to do were like orders. I'm not an animal that is to be threatened of a job loss because of the incompetence of my seniors. If something was to be done the lower working associates would be left to do it wither or not experienced while the other seniors would sometimes clock out leaving the problem with the lower workers and causing people to lose their jobs.
good,"Co-workers are very helpful to new employee's making the job easier. Everyday has a routine that cannot be overlooked or ignored. Management was awesome, sometimes hard to balance work and home life."
good,"Great place to work for especially while in school"
good,"Co-workers were fun, CSM's were cool. Job itself not hard, boring at times. Management not always understandable bout things that happen in ur personal lifes."
good,"A typical work day was full of helping customers find product they needed, answering any questions they had. Stocking the department, learning the new product so if and when a customer needed it or had questions I could be as knowledgeable as possible. My co-workers and I worked on things projects together at times when it was needed. The hardest part of the days where when my co-workers or myself were pulled away from the department to go to other departments, I felt then that our department was left without the attention it needed. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping customers with anything they needed help with, being a question or finding the perfect item they needed."
good,"The day would start depending which shift you were scheduled. The day would be helping customers with dropping off and inputting prescriptions daily. Verify all patient information was correct. Trouble shooting any problems with insurance or 3rd party issues. Filling prescriptions in a timely manner, bagging and checking customers out at the register. I enjoyed all the people I came in contact with on a  daily basis."
good,"Each day I assist the pharmacist with filling and dispensing medication to patients, In my to years as a tech with walmart I have learned a lot in regards to customer service and pharmacy tech advancement."
good,"This is a great place to work if you have children you need to care for and allows for flexibility. It is good for experience and it is somewhat difficult to move up in the company, but if you don't want it as a career then it is good for students and parents looking for a part-time job."
good,"Everyday was a different scene, new faces, and new issues. the management is great and the customer service is great! the hardest part of the job is the hours , they are long. but the easiest and most enjoyable part is the interaction with people and of course the pay check at the end of the pay period!"
good,"Merchandising and sort as directed to infants and girls wear. Providing compassionate and reliable customer service, Interaction with customer and making them feel welcomed."
good,"You do tasks given (programmed in your machine) , in which are scheduled before your shift. You can check off if you have completed the tasks at the end of your shift. "
good,"es un ambiente laboral de acuerdo a piso de ventas con mis compañeras, en cuestion a la gerencia es algo reservada no nos da muchas opciones para mejorar las ventas exigiendonos buenas ventas y buena presentacion,pero con pocas opciones a realizar un ejemplo de eso pide ventas pero  si algo no le gusta pide que se meta a bodega aun que sea 100% bodega, me gusta mi trabajo porque aprendes cosas nuevas en el departamento de bebes yo desconocia muchas cosas y ahora conosco muchas funciones en accesorios para bebe en formulas,entre otras tengo una buena relacion con mis promotores,me gusta convinar la ropa de bebe para mejor ventas,"
good,Scan and pack customers bags while getting yelled at for wrongly marked prices that you know are totally your fault. While enjoying listening to screaming children and snobby judgemental old people. Great job to have if you already have no self worth.
good,Very difficult to advance within the company and little benefits.  Great atmosphere and teamwork. I would recommend for a first time job
good,"Working at walmart has its ups and downs. I like it, a typical day is mostly routine. The people that walk around all have a smile on their face and make you feel appreciated in a way. The hours are good, but depending on what department you work, you might work 9 hour shifts on the daily without flexibility."
good,"I would build bicycles and got to work with some great people.  I got to help customers get bikes.  Overall, it was a great experience"
good,"the only bad thing was that you cant swap your schedule on nights and I was really having to do my best not to get fired for hurting a fellow employee after he followed me around asking if I was gay and did crack, there was a warning issued but when it was apparent that the employee wasn't leaving me alone and the managers did nothing about it afterwards I had to look at was better for my family me to be jobless looking for a job or me be jobless in jail not able to look for a job."
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for . I enjoy working with the public. The hardest part of a working day is getting off on time. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing all of our customers walked out of the store happy. Management is awesome. I've learned Three other departments while working at Wal - Mart.
good,"On a normal day you might help customers find what they are looking for, push buggies, or unload a truck. Management was okay for the most part. there were a few times when management made your work feel unappreciated. I really enjoyed most of my co-workers. they were a lot of fun to work with."
good,"Answering the phone helping the customers. That people are different and many attitudes to work with, It was a job where you have room to grow within the company ,You also can go from one department to another to learn more skills."
good,Walmart provided me with continued work and steady income.  It is a good place to work.  My coworkers are fun to work with as well.
good,"This was a great job for me in high school."
good,"I worked here while I was completing my undergraduate and law school degrees. The hourly rate is competitive when compared to other local comparable employers, 401k with matching, even for part time, and excellent flexibility with my school schedule as well as transfers to stores closer to home for summer."
good,"empresa de boa dinâmica, nela aprendi a trabalhar bem com equipe e desenvolver a minha comunicação"
good,"A very busy place to work, I learned many aspects of the business, I was the go to girl, If someone needed help they would come to me. My co-workers were great and taught me alot."
good,You have to be very hardworking and patient and plan all vactions 3 weeks ahead of schedule is released. there is a 90 day probation. you also cant have 3 days worth of absences except for being called to jury duty or some type of emergency concerning family or personal health.
good,Wal-Mart was a great learning experience and it has opened my public eye. Wal-Mart shows you the different prospective of cultures. Wal-Mart has the best co workers but the worst management.
good,Great place to work and nice friendly co-workers. Have some great managers that will help out when behind. Pay is really the only bad thing with this job.
good,"Clean workplace, Friendly managers you can move up pretty quick winter time hours get cut a little bit back room fills up to where theres no space . Dress code was great until they changed it . Overall Pretty enjoyable place to work"
good,Had a great experience overall. Learned some new things. Was also depressing sometimes when the work load increased but overall a fun experience.
good,A different task everyday. Must keep up with busy shoppers during holidays. Co-workers are friendly. Having the 401k and other benefits is definitely nice.
good,"I really enjoyed working in the photo lab. I worked with an energetic group of women. I also, really enjoyed working with customers."
good,"My tasked ranged from stocking the shelves to straightening the departments. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the customer. There are many different people that shop at WalMart, some more pleasant than others. I felt accomplished making sure the customers I came in contact with had an enjoyable experience, and was able to find all of their needs."
good,"Working a day at Wal-Mart was great I provided fast friendly check out I also cleaned and stocked the produce section."
good,A lot of interesting people come thru Wal-Mart. I was hired around Christmas so a lot of shoppers were everywhere. When the trucks come in the floor crew had to stop whatever they were doing to help unload..
good,"stocking shelves, down stacking pallets. i learned communication skills and team work.my coworkers were great people to work with but i really think the management could of used more work. The hardest part of my job was having so many things to do in such so little time.The most enjoyable thing about my job was working with people i knew and were understanding and always helpful"
good,Walmart was a great place to work for. They have job security and really appreciate their employees. Managers was great the only down side was when family emergencies come up you can't miss your max days or I would still be there.
good,You are able to achieve plenty of good paid miles. Paid for all activity performed and paid for wait times away from DC. New equipment is provided. Very strict policies.
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho : Dinâmico e Grande Demanda"
good,"Busy, productive work place with never a dull moment. You are always working on something. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the customer say's Thankyou for helping them find and item."
good,"Wal-Mart was a very fast paced and educational job. It taught me a lot about working in a retail environment and what to expect when shopping at other retail outlets. A day at Wal-Mart can make or break you for retail-oriented jobs as far as the customer base and the employee base. The customer base has a tendency to range the entire scope of what you expect to see in a retail store and some you don't expect to see. I learned to hope for the best and expect the worst daily, because patience is your best friend when working in one of the biggest corporate retail chains in the United States and world. The coworkers are jovial and fun to be around, but tend to be a little on the lazy side when it comes to following their job description. The management tends to turn the other cheek and sometimes even ignore situations, like the one that led me to leave them. I would have to say that the hardest part, in general, was the customer base and the spontaneity of change in personality between customers. More specifically, they tend to range from the nicest and most compassionate, to the rudest and most vulgar people on earth. The hardest part of the job also does tend to be the most enjoyable as well, since I work with some of the kindest and most compassionate people on the planet and they tend to be very understanding when things that occasionally go wrong, do. In conclusion, this company does have a bad rapport, but that bad rapport is the minority in a world of people who have shopped at this company for 20+ years and have nothing but good things to say about them. Every job has its"
good,"Handling money at the register, answering phone calls and faxes, checking out patients when picking up their medication, standing by HIPPA"
good,"It was a very interesting day going to work. I worked hard at my job., it was very different. I help all types of people that came into the walmart from blind to deaf. I was happy to help them"
good,Great customers. easy to sell glasses and make extra money. Advancement is there if you would like to move up in the company. They have great benefits and profit sharing.
good,"Siempre se revisan La temperatura de los medicamentos refrigerados se lleva el control de humedad relativa y ambiental, limpieza, se realizan juntas con gerencia para revisar puntos críticos,se recibe mercancía de proveedores y del centro de distribución checando facturas y se acomodan de acuerdo al criterio de primeras entradas primeras salidas, se le da atención a la clientela se le da atención a correos para nuevas directrices. lo que más me gustó es solucionar las dudas de la gente que requería información,el ambiente de trabajo es frío, la preparación de inventarios es de especial cuidado."
good,"very busy,my boss is not extremely good, management is not good,"
good,"I love having jobs in going to work and at this Walmart job they taught me that team work is the best way to get things done fast. We had different task split between us everyday. my co-workers were awesome I felt right at home when I first got hired in that's because Im a very open person in I love to meet new people and actually learn something about them besides where they work. The hardest part about my job was there was never enough for me to do, I always finished my task a little early in would over check it multiply times but I love a job were it keeps me busy my whole shift. The most enjoyable part was honestly the people I worked with in the costumers they always kept a smiling on my face n motivated to do my best at my job to make sure There Local grocery store was cleaned properly."
good,Worked from 10 pm to 7am. Did have an hour lunch which I think is stupid because you are less productive from my experience afterward. Management was a joke because there was employee/management relationships and also favoritism.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in an stocking/binning product that the overnight crew was unable to work. "
good,"I began as a cashier with this company and had the opportunity for advancement as a customer service representative for about a year.  I learned to how to utilize my intuitive skills to read the emotions of customers, as well as how to maintain diplomacy in difficult situations. Management was very supportive and also very approachable. I experienced great closeness with my coworkers and valued being a part of a functioning team.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate or dishonest customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others and seeing the smiles on people's faces."
good,The pay is reasonable. You get plenty of hours. You don't really have a life because your hours are all over the place. Management just showed up to work didn't really care for the need of employees
good,"Trained alot when I became a Dept, Manager learn how to perform different task.I would recommended them for anyone starting out in retail"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo...apoyo de los jefes,en ocaciones demasiada precion estres, compañeros tolerantes de buen caracter"
good,got some good job skills that were transferrable and had opportunity to meet a wide variety of people from all areas of country.
good,"Working for Walmart, I've learned excellent customer service techniques. I've learned how to be more patient and attentive to other people and their needs. It has been a learning experience in respect for the individual. The hardest part of my job is having to say no to a customer due to policy procedures. However, whenever I can come up with different alternatives that makes the customer happy, I leave happy."
good,Very difficult place to work. Employees always seem to be down about something. It was a challenge to keep their spirits up and keep them motivated.
good,Quick paced and can leave you behind if your not self motivated. I have worked with multiple managers and they have all been good.
good,"when working for Wal-Mart my job consisted of order picking,"
good,"I Greet and help a large volume of customers on the cash register.     The managers are very helpful when u need them, the co-workers are okay but nice often. The hardest part of the job is sometimes my arm socket gets really sore from scanning so many items, and the best part about it is meeting different people daily."
good,you got to meet new people and hourly wage was over minimum wage. there was room for advancement. I enjoyed it there always a clean work atmosphere.
good,Wal-mart was the first actual job I had out of high school.  I had a chance to meet a lot of people and acquire a lot of new skills.
good,"Great Job, loved it. Fast pace, excitement, fun and great customer service. We put helping our customers at the top of the chart and getting our work done as quick as possible. That was until, we got a new manager. That's when everything change for the worst. She became more about the products, than helping the customers. She cared more about her than us. She tried to schedule me while I had school and told me, ""This life, so choose what's more important to you. Money now or money later."" I quit after that, because school is more important and she played innocent when I reported her. Basically, the job was great, management needs work."
good,not very much team work and all the harder working  associates had to take up the slack of the non worker that should have been fired
good,"Company will hire just about anyone with a pulse. They will start you off at the bottom, and either you fit in or you don't. If you think that the employees are the odd ones, the customers are just as entertaining....Work is not hard, but most employees do the minimum they can get away with. The ones that go beyond do not get rewarded, and their effort becomes expected. The ones who don't show up for work and don't care are the ones promoted and pushed."
good,Decent job you get benefits after one year and 2 weeks paid vacation. co-workers gossip a lot and management comes down hard if things are not perfect but if you can get past that its a great place for you
good,"Being in the produce department of Walmart, everyday is very fast paced.  "
good,Provide excellent customer service whilst preparing and safely handling food. Taking stock of daily inventory and merchandising new items and displays.
good,Its great for students who are looking to do 12 to 20 hours a week. The management respect every individual at walmart and your co-workers are respectable people. But if you want to make a career at walmart I would not recommend it since promotions or a job advancement take years as a full timer.
good,. Being a cashier you meet the community. Get to talk to different people everyday. Hours are not great. Management is easy to talk to. Promotions are available.
good,i lloved the different variety of work opportunities i had at pizza hut and the crew and managers were very helpful an nice
good,"By the time I left, it was not the same place I started. It no longer seemed as family we were one big family."
good,"Fun place to work with supportive management. Learned a lot about customer service, and working with a diverse group of people."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, a parte da gerencia era proativa e sempre vendo os dois lados a do funcionario e a da empresa sem buscando o melhor para ambas partes"
good,"typical day at work was overall good , the management was amazing worked with everyone schedule , what I loved most about my job was helping others and them walking out smiling"
good,I learned a lot about jewelery. How to repair many different breaks and stone loss. Most co-workers were great and helpful. The pay was good and hours were good. Didn't work weekends so that was great
good,"I learned how to cope with everyday problems, and multiple customer needs and concerns. I also learned how to operate my work station, while keeping it neat and orderly. Making each and every customer feel welcome as they walked into the store, and tending to whatever question they asked of me. I became a more punctual, motivated person while working at Walmart, regardless of only being there for a short time."
good,The staff and customers are great to work with. They are also very understanding about your outside life and give you a flexible schedule.
good,Not a bad place to start. Easy work with ok pay. It can get slow and boring at times but all in all I did not mind working there...lots of breaks and decent starting pay.
good,"Hours, coworkers, and team work were all above standard. Most of the management/ leaders were great! Summers were hot, but worth the sweating for the pay at the time. Good place to work."
good,A day at Walmart is basically being on a register until its your break or lunch time. Learned some new pointers as far as customers and how to deal with them. My co-workers we're pretty cool. The hardest part of the job was keeping every customer happy being that it was such a busy store.
good,I worked at both Walmart and Sams Club. They both had good points and bad. Insurance and Dental were not bad. You get a discount at Walmart and a membership card at Sams. Down side was the lack of professionalism with the management at times.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers walk away happy, with a smile on their face, when I provided them with great service."
good,I have learned about servant leadership and met a number of great leaders within the company. I like to lead by example and gain the respect from my associates by utilizing coaching by walking around and teaching and training methods.
good,Good intentions and great people to work with. The benefits are wonderful. Okay hours and pay. Weekly team meetings. The hardest part is whenever we got really busy you would have to keep up with the extra face pace work environment.
good,its not a bad job but its not a great job either it gives me money and i get to interact with people everyday and still give everyone a smile and treat them how i would want to be treated.
good,Every day is different but its still the same work everyday. Customer service on cars is always difficult! Managers are fun and easy to work with.
good,"I loved working at walmart, and i would go back. management was perfect excellent team members. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers even if they were difficult the thank you's as they left always made it so you felt like you did your job."
good,Besides all the Holiday Celebration servings and Acknowledgements that Wal-Mart did. I feel that they should treat there employees a little better and pay more for the required job especially when it's at a high demand.
good,"Wal-Mart hire many people of different cultures, races and religions. They are respectful of each other's differences and also celebrates them."
good,"provides its workers some good chances but it's hard to keep a second job and they do not pay enough, have enough seats in the k if you like you can continue to work related accidents, the compensation system is not good, nor does your insurance"
good,"A typical day at Walmart could be stressful but rewarding at times, without the hands on experience of on the job training there nothing that could really prepare you for that job.It was fun place to work with good people and quite the experiences."
good,"empresa boa para se trabalhar aonde você aprende muita coisas ,ce te dar orportonidade de crescimento"
good,"Em geral uma empresa dinâmica que de acordo com o desempenho e vontade de cada funcionário, vai desenvolvendo habilidades."
good,"Coworkers all stick together like a family, they help one another as well as look out for each other. Management can tend to micromanage but it is all for the greater good of the store. The hardest part of the job is the disrespect from customers and the stereotype of a walmart employee."
good,Love the day to day interactions with customers and fellow associates. Just wish that more people are as passionate about this as I am.
good,"I worked in the auto departmegot upset.nt so a typical day i sold tires,batteries, oil changes etc. i enjoyed working with my co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was working by yourself and if it was busy,sometimes the customers"
good,"Me gusto el trato de los jefes hacia mi, lo negativo es que no iba a subir de puesto nunca, era lo unico que haria."
good,"working for walmart almost 14 years. rules change like the sun coming up everyday,some good some not so good,but if there wasn't change in the world/job.there wouldn't be any room for inprovement"
good,"Management was turned over and the new management made so many new changes such as job cuts, hours cut. They do teach you a lot of areas in the store so you get more experience in different departments"
good,Great company to work for I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work Wal-Mart. The open door policy with the store manager makes it easy to express any concerns or discuss any problems an associate might have. Great hours with many opportunities to advance within the company.
good,fun place to work fun people hours are not the best and management could be better met some great customers and coworkers
good,"A typical day is a 9-10 hour shift, we would provide checkout service to customers, give advice on items, make sure the customers are aware of sales and clearance items. Some customers are not satisfied at the end but we try to make sure we can help them as much as possible. They usually complain to managers but that's only cause they was the best prices for the best items and the only way to get better is to learn from mistakes.The best part of the job is the people, sometimes its bad but the employees and customers are so happy and create conversation easily making the time there seem short. Everyone is very welcoming and helps if any situation comes to hand."
good,"not fair to employees, onlt to the owners. rules changes everyday. I enjoyed my co-workers. they at you and not to you. everyone is out for self, not team players"
good,"Dealing with customers would be the most challenging aspect of the job. management has high expectations of those that show initiative, but with little to no reward. Higher positions garner disproportionately higher stress levels and minimal increase in pay until salaried position is reached. That said, this job takes care of its workers and allows students to continue education easily."
good,"my typical day at work is to make sure all shelves are stocked. I have learned that to work at an overnight job that requires hard labor is that you need to make sure you get enough rest because if not, you will get tired extremely fast. My management team is ok for the most part. My co-workers are great, we all work together as a team. the hardest part of my job is pulling pallets."
good,"Working at wamart was a good experience overall. Besides some political type issues which are common for such a large company which i believe is the only thing wrong in my time there, this company pays well, gives you time for family if you are not at a higher level, but requires hitting very tough goals. I would recommend them as a good employer."
good,"Assiting costumers with online purchase order, Getting orders ready for pick up. Merchandise sorting. Learned how to deal with costumers and how to satify their needs."
good,Na empresa pude crescer aprender novas atividades e em diferentes áreas. Além de aprender a trabalhar com pessoas em um ambiente de dinâmico e com forte cultura interna.
good,"Productive, fast paced, and ever-changing work environment with good job security and excellent room for advancement"
good,"Being a Pharmacy Tech was very enlightening and has a never ending source of knowledge that is applicable to daily life. I felt my work was vital to customers, not just an expendable service."
good,"I showed up at work, started stocking shelves, watered the flowers, help customers, cleaned up, i stayed pretty busy at times, sometimes mangers would ask me to go in other parts of the store to help out, i really enjoyed my time there..."
good,"A typical day at Walmart behind the jewelry counter consisted of helping customers pick out wedding sets and other jewelry for themselves or as gifts. I pierced ears, took special orders, ran the cash register, adjusted watch bands and kept the counter and area tidy and neat."
good,"Empresa em geral é uma empresa ótima para se trabalhar, porém alguns superiores não cooperam para o nosso desenvolvimento para o crescimento profissional. Mais fora isso posso afirmar com toda a certeza que é uma grande empresa e que ensina muito. Tenho a imensa certeza que todos os funcionários aprendem todos os dias algo novo. E muitos os que podem dizer que não aprenderam foi porque na verdade não agarrou a oportunidade que teve."
good,"been with the company for 16 months, first store refused to promote me because i was too honest in my interview. so when i decide to transfer to a new store management tried to keep me with empty promises. once i transferred to a new store i was happy until my department was closed down and i was forced into a new department where i had no experience and caused me to fail and step down as a supervisor."
good,es un buen trabajo pero en algunas ocasiones se ponen exigentes en ciertos aspectos
good,"Loved the hours, able to be with family. Management was fair and helpful.  Could have gotten better wages.  I had a great relationship with my co-workers."
good,"The work was easy, the hardest part to deal with were not enough help. But it helped me work on my customer service skills and helped be relate to people better. All my co-workers were team players which made the day go by easier. the hardest part of the job would be rush hour when everything had to be put out on the shelf."
good,"great place work."
good,Decent company to work for. You will learn a lot working there. There is just not a lot of growth opportunity working with this company.
good,"Great starting job, good environment great benefits and is always a good place to start as a first job. Everybody is friendly and "
good,At times the day was unorganized because too many people didn't want to work or felt like they didn't have to do there work
good,"Good place to work. Well structured, nice people to work with, provides good lifelong skills. Positive work environment."
good,"This company isn't quite bad for a work environment.  The pay isn't the best but depending on one's lifestyle and position, it can pay the bills.  Regardless there are (2)15 min breaks and an hour break.  the majority of employees have a long term dedication. They even support and inspire employees to continue school, or even career seeking either with Walmart or somewhere else.  I believe that the day management is more organized than the night management.  While working days everything goes quite well and tasks seem to be executed efficiently.  While working nights is another story. Policies are strict but very easy and reasonable to adapt. The enjoyable part of the job is that employees voices are heard.  Suggestions are always welcomed.  They do not discriminate at all, and if someone does they are dealt with usually a termination.  They truly are pro-equal rights! There is no room for head butting as they have many positions, counseling and behavioral methods."
good,"clocked in to work at 4,"
good,"Restocking , unloading and inventorying materials which came off truck for the electronics department. Helping customer with there needs. Helping new co-workers locating items."
good,"A typical workday consist of breaking the truck down, prepping the meat, bringing it to thee floor and assisting customers. My co-workers are easy to get along with.The hardest part of the job is unreasonable customers. The most enjoyable part is being able to help customers out with their needs."
good,Walmart provided me with advancement and security i have never had at any other job. The environment is very fast paced and always exciting
good,"Not bad to work, I would come in get straight to work and if you have thing that need to be change like school or family, they can help you around your schedule. It was not bad working over there."
good,"Ups and downs, busy and slow times. My coworkers were amazing and wonderful to work with. Not the best judge of management characters, and unfair advancement. The hardest part of the job was the occasional and very rare rude customer. The most enjoyable part was seeing my favorite customers come through and the connections I made with them. Also the company holiday get-togethers were nice and always well planned. This is where I first learned how fun customer service could be as well as cash handling. On the occasion we had a bad manager, and they were quickly replaced by a better more store focused one."
good,"- leaned proper MSDS procedures"
good,typical day at work was just getting straight to cashiering. Cleaned my area. Co-workers were nice but it seemed like high school with a ton of gossip and drama. Fun part of working at Walmart is just meeting new people and conversing with the returning customers.
good,Foi uma grande experiencia pois como foi o meu primeiro emprego tive uma grande oportunidade de crescimento profissional.
good,performing cash transactions. how to work with others and communicate better.the management there can be better. the people there are overall nice.the hardest part can be the customers and the best part is making a change.
good,When I first started working at walmart I loved it. the staff was nice everyone was nice. then one week people just started being really rude and staff started slacking and people were favorting people and i got treated un fairly and couldnt take it anymore.
good,The Walmart company has been fairly well to me in my employment with them. There is a growth within the company and you are able to climb the walmart ladder into higher posistions with experience or the chance to gain some.
good,"The job was simple enough. It got a bit hampered by the lack of quality equipment to help us complete it, but the other workers were vigilant for the most part. I learned the importance of working as part of a team here, and improving upon my communication skills as well."
good,"La presión era tan alta que no se podía trabajar a gusto, pero las personas con las que trabajas son buenas personas y trabajadoras, la dirección es muy estricta o al menos donde me todo trabajar, creo que eso era lo que menos me gustaba pues los demás trabajas que desempeñe ahí ya los había visto en otra empresa."
good,sometimes its hard to get everything done on time do to pressure by management work is done shorthanded most of the time.
good,"Una de las empresas mas grandes del mundo , Walmart "
good,Essa empresa foi meu primeiro local de trabalho então aprendi muitas coisas la dentro que puderam me ajudar em outros empregos.
good,You come in and do what is expected of you. It's not a bad job or a great one. The people were nice and it's a well paying job. I'm looking for something different. I want to earn experience elsewhere.
good,"I do enjoy my days at Wal-mart simply because the workplace environment is one to experience. There is definitely a diverse community in the Wal-mart family. Along with a diverse amount of customers. Do your best to please everyone with the excellent customer service skills you definitely should have working there and not to take things personal. Hard work, fast-paced, and exciting is how I would describe my experience at Wal-mart."
good,"Excellent place to work, not good work/life balance. Excellent advancement opportunities as long as you were willing to play the game."
good,"Wal-mart is a good place to work, with lot of opportunities to employees who are students. my experience working in walmart is a little hard, not because of the establishment itself but because of managerial problem"
good,"Consistent breaks, physically demanding, great people and diversity. Every day is different, despite being the same job."
good,"stock shelves from trucks"
good,"A typical day at work consists of cooking, cleaning, and making sure our customers are happy. Making orders so we don't run out of food, doing inventory, multitasking and making sure everyone is part of the team."
good,I liked working this job. I enjoyed getting to know the customers and my co-workers. I also learned a lot from working here.
good,"Awesome staff and productive place to work great management, also very fun at some points also some what rewarding overall great place to work"
good,"Nice place to work, a little stressful when you have to deal with angry customers because we did not have enough workers. Co-workers are very nice and helpful."
good,A day at work at wal mart could be a stressful day or an easy day. You go into work not preparing like you did the day before you go in aware of your work. I learned that if you do your work and do it well you will move up in the company. The management at Wal Mart is an average depending on how the manager wants to work but i learned from them that doing your work no matter for which manager they will appreciate you on finishing and completing your tasks. Theres no hard part to the job its just getting everyone else motivated to work with you and being a team to work through the whole night making sure you complete all your tasks. Everyday is and enjoyable day at work because its another day you get to be productive and make customers happy.
good,Productive and useful work environment with good and friendly personnel and my direct supervisor is awesome. I learn new things and ways to deal with a daily customer service and money in us.
good,this job is busy all the time your alwasy on your feet but its good customer service interaction and good benefits pay is fair and its usually pretty easy to move up
good,very good co-workers. I had a very good relationship with my co workers and customers were always nice. Management could be a lot nicer with employees and help out more often when behind.
good,"I have learned alot about computers, tablets, electrical wires while working at walmart. it may not be electrical wire considered for this job, but i am attending MECC to get my electro-mechanical degree."
good,"Walmart has long hours, but you receive a quick pay raise. There is good communication with employees and management. Nice resources."
good,A typical day at work you were expected to keep the store clean and presentable for customers as if it was your own business. Maintain all equipment for the doctor and opticians and report any maintenance needed.  I learned how to delegate and be more flexible with schedules and co workers.  Management was difficult as there were lots of meetings and as employees we were expected to run the store as if we were all managers and were not trained to do so.  The hardest part of the job is always pleasing the customers and you have legal aspects with HIPAA that bar you from releasing certain information which in turn makes customers angry because they don't understand that.  The most enjoyable part of working for this company was dealing with the doctor I worked for. He really understood and taught me a lot that I never knew.  Wal-Mart provides a lot of training which is mandated and has to be done on the clock which in a busy atmosphere makes it very challenging to finish.
good,Very demanding. Job and Life balance difficult to balance. Most enjoyable part is working and developing associates.
good,"Our team did a great job running the front end. Food was always well prepped, hot with good proportions. Enjoyed dealing with the senior citizens who knew what they wanted and how it should be."
good,"I was fine with working at Walmart during the summer, but as for a permanent career, I would rather not. Most of my coworkers were ok and some of the management was pretty nice. However, the rest weren't so great. Some of the managers were rude and unfriendly. Also the general clientele attracted by this particular store could not be described as particularly desirable. Also, a stunt Walmart likes to pull is scheduling part time employees part time hours (32 hrs/week) for part time pay, but they expect employees to stay longer shifts up to 40 hrs/week, which also means no benefits or PTO"
good,A typical day at work is a steady pace. There is always something to keep employees business. I have experience in being a overnight stocker when I resided in New Jersey.
good,"I started night-shift after I clocked in, then we would have a team meeting before we continued with work. The purpose of the team meetings was to let the Walmart staff know about productivity and where the night-shift staff would be assigned for the night till the early morning. The Job was very demanding, and management didn't care if you needed help, just as long as your work was finished. Management only assisted when they realized, certain jobs wasn't able to be done without the necessary help, but besides management my co workers was excellent and hard working. The hardest part about the job is stocking because its so many boxes of food and different items that it difficult, but the most enjoyable part about the job was my co workers."
good,I enjoyed working with public and fellow employee. The work was even paced and fare.The management was mostly fare on treatment of employees. The should not only focus on negative but possitive also.
good,"I love Wal-Mart, but there are too many issues with my store.  It has increased my anxieties and stress and could definitely use a refinement."
good,"I worked there for 10 years.  I enjoyed my time there and did have opportunity to move-up, but the work environment was stressful."
good,"If the pay was higher and decent benefits were offered, I would have stayed. I loved the customer interaction and the management was fair and understanding."
good,I am a hard working student and young father. Walmart does not recognize this or care. They put me to work like cattle. They will not give me the full time title because they do not want to waste money on giving me or my young family any benefits.
good,I enjoyed helping others find the things they need in everyday life. Management team were nice and the co-workers. I enjoyed being part of the team. I just didn't like the crazy hours and unsteady work schedule.
good,"I was a department manager here and I had a wonderful time. The managers are exactly the best but those good one tend to be hard to come by. The other associate I worked with were great, very nice and caring people. I also had a wonderful time at work and looked forward to going there everyday. The associates treated me as a higher authority to them as they should have and we all got along wonderfully. The hours were wonderful and really worked for me at the time."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart because it was in a great environment, with great co-workers and loved my customers. I liked having lunch with friends and talking random. Management was great at the time. I just did understand retaking CBL's all the time if you already knew them by heart."
good,A typical work day at Wal-Mart would be ok.. We would be extremely busy on the first of the month.  I really learned to control my mouth while dealing with different type of people. I wished the management team would actually worked as a team. Most of the people I worked with where ok once you got to learn them.
good,Very good company to work for. Excellent for people who need a good start in the retail sector. Will open doors to next challenges.
good,"un dia de trabajo es relajante , uno aprendo muchas cosas como tratar un cliente o a su superiores , la gerencia es dividida hay tratos buenos y malos no son parejos con algunos empleados , mis compañeros muy buenos la mayoria siempre hay uno o dos que dan la nota , no hay una parte dificil en el trabajo digamos que puede ser cuando viene una visita de algun supervisor de tienda o districtal , lo que mas me gusto el poder fortalecer en mi esperiencia  laboral y conocimientos en diferrentes areas gracias a los cursos que nos daban a diario ."
good,the supervisors and cams are very unresponsible and didn't measure up to the top . i loved working at walmart greeting customers since they come in if no customers in line we reship which is clean up the isle closest to us and remove every item that doesn't belong their. it is a fast paced moving job which i love
good,"A typical day at walmart includes helping customers according to their needs. It can vary for different customers some are looking for specific items and some of them just need help to locate specific departments. After two years in walmart, i was able to improve  in my customer service skills and understood how to deal with different situation. The best part of working in walmart is the whole team that is working with you in the store. They all are nice and ready to help each other if anyone needs help. The hardest part of the job is to make sure always the department look nice and clean, so there is no accidents."
good,"Responsible for 12 -15 man team to unload both General Merchandise and grocery trucks with in required time lines; As well as at appropriate time deliver merchandise to different departments for the night restocking teams to set the merchandise."
good,Los jefes de todos los departamentos son precionados y provocan que el ambientite sea ostil
good,"A typical day at Walmart was a good hard working day."
good,"Cut fabric for customers help them find whatever they needed. I learned about different projects my customers like to do. Management would help us if we needed help, we worked together with our co-workers always helping each other, The hardest part is sometimes not being able to find the item my customer wanted. I always enjoyed  seeing my customers happy with what I found for them,"
good,"At Walmart, an associate usually works 4.5 hours a day to 8 hours a day. They are mostly consistent on giving breaks every two hours."
good,Working for this Walmart was a great experience I learned alot from the associates that i worked with. management was always willing to work with schedules for family and other events.
good,tended to backroom area insuring items needed stocked was pulled to the floor and items in the backroom was organized and put away properly
good,Management could have been more helpful and given asisstaance when needed. Several cashiers were not given the chance to explain coinflict re rude and beligerant custoimers
good,"Aprendi cosas nuevas como todo el movimiento de la tienda en su cierres de dia y recoleccion de dinero asi el emvio a tecnoval."
good,"pagas todos os direitos do funcionário, da descansos compatíveis, da alimentação por fora, da participação nos lucros, empresa muito boa de trabalhar"
good,"Working at Walmart gave me more experience in customer service and quality of work being done. It was great when I first started. I would always greet customers with a smile and say hello to make them feel welcome. I would sell and fix items, as well as make the place look nice with the time being given. We always put out new merchandise, so I would help process and put away the items. My two best friends are co-workers of mine. They are great. My other co-workers are fine to work with, but there are some who choose to create problems and drama. In some cases that made some co-workers of mine cry, and I also have experienced it. I would go to my management about it and we would have a meeting or a sit down about the situation, but then a few days to weeks later it would repeat. It became like a broken record, to the point where I have had enough. Management didn't know how to deal with situation either than just talking about it. That was the hardest part of the job. The enjoyable part is helping others and making friends. Its a good experience, but something I wouldn't do again."
good,Set up 12-15 new accounts for cell phone service a day. Deal with the customers that have questions about their accounts/ billing issues as well. Assist with new merchandise as logging the phones in and making sure on hands are correct.
good,es un trabajo muy estresante y un pago realmente bajo te hacen hacer horas extras diciendo que te las van a pagar y luego te terminan descansando y sus aumentos de sueldo son de 100 pesos por año pero realmente es un lugar tranquilo aunque cuando el trabajo se acumula se vuelve un caos aparte que son varios subgerentes que no se coordinan ala hora de dar sus ordenes ya que luego se contradicen
good,"working for wal-mart was exciting yet tedious. Being a cashier and providing customer service was my job however when the customer had questions for a supervisor, it took forever for the managers to get to the customers and resolve the issue."
good,"Quick-paced job with many peaks, but of course the number one priority was customer satisfaction. Daily objectives were to process monetary transactions and maintain a clean workspace."
good,"Walmart Stores Inc. Global Shared Services of Charlotte is a great place to work.  The upper management not only preaches, but also practices the 3 basic beliefs: Respect for the individual, strive for excellence, and service to the customer.  I typically get to work between 7 and 8 AM.  I check my email and put together a task list to be completed by close of business.  As issues arise, I tackle them on an independent basis.  The most difficult part about my job is sometimes juggling what is a ""fire"" and what is an ""issue'.  Because my job is to insure that a machine is running properly, it is more reactive and associates believe that their issue should take precedent over anyone else's.  However, the need is determined through proper troubleshooting and communication with the associates.  However, where this sometimes is the most difficult, it is also the most enjoyable.  Communication is always the most important part of any relationship, and I thrive well in this area."
good,"I enjoyed everything that I did, from helping the customers to working in the backroom. I enjoyed working in every department just to learn different skills."
good,I enjoy working at Wal-Mart as a temporary job. My co-workers stay focused and work hard. My management team help out and make sure everyone has a clear understanding of what to do.
good,"Walmart is a frustrating place to work because they are rarely fully staffed.One person is often required to do the job of three or four people because the store is not staffed with enough people to run it. Walmart also expects or believes that jobs that would require multiple people and multiple days to accomplish can be resolved by one person in half the amount of time. They don't always train their associates. There are computer based learning modules that give and overview of what is required for specific positions but once on the sales floor it's often a sink or swim environment. Walmart has taken the phrase ""the customer is always right"" to heart. The customer is always right even when they are completely wrong or flat out lying and rude they are still right."
good,"WalMart was my first job, so I was not sure what to expect. I grew to love the company and wanted to move up several times, but it never happened for whatever reason. Like at any job, there were managers that were not always the best but there were others who loved what they did and it showed in their work."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was pretty good for most part, I have learned a lot working their such as more about customer service and the different emotions people have when they come through the doors. My co-workers were awesome very nice and friendly! I really enjoyed working with people and the public. I would have to say the hardest part about working their would have to be when Wal-Mart did not have enough cashiers and it would get very busy in there."
good,"I love working at Wal-Mart. buy the pay was not cool.  How still makes 7.75 an hour."
good,"Typical work day is walking consistently, cleaning and extremely hot. Learned order filling, and to apply myself in a fast work environment. Hardest part of the job was baring the heat during summer time. Enjoyable time was the safety give always and employee resignation."
good,"We opened with checking emails for recalls and taking voicemails off phone for processing prescriptions. We had a Filler a resolution tech to fix insurance claims and a tech to input new rx's from overnight. Recalls were pulled right away if there were any for the day and MD's were faxed for change in therapy for anyone on those meds. Hardest part was the amount we processed but we were all used to it. Our store also processed the most CII's so we were always ordering and know for the lowest prices. I enjoy my job incredibly. I love that I am very good at billing insurance claims, solving mysteries and clueing into pharmacy hoppers, yet kindly letting them know we couldn't fill at the moment."
good,"Se realiza la apertura de la unidad a las 6:00 am, Cierre de sistema de las ventas de un dia antes,apertura de la unidad  clientes, recibo de mercancia por parte de Centro de Distribucion y proveedores, acomodo y orden de la misma, atencion a clientes todo el dia, atencion y seguimiento a instrucciones de Mercadeo ,comunicacion y superiores, la parte mas dificil es el acomodo de la mercacia ya que el espacio es demasiado pequeño, lo que mas me gusto es la atencion al clientes y el trabajo con los asociados de la unidad"
good,"Work was quick, which made work go by fast. I learned a lot about people and myself--  like the fact that I am a very quick and efficient worker. The hardest part of the job was the fact that sometimes you'd have to go on break earlier than you'd like and then be hungry later, but you get a 15 minute break every two hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to customers when there was no one in my line."
good,i work the 10pm- to 7am shift. i basically pull stuff from the back room and bring it to the floor for the stockers to put out. after that i put the overstock back in the bins in the back room
good,This place started my career and everyone was supportive enough to help me grow as a skilled technician. IT gave me oppurtunity to train others too
good,As a gm unloader walmart was a challenge.At the time i was hired we had a good management on hand.But as business goes management changed.And with that our teams attitude began to decline.But we managed through it and shined.The team i worked with were a blast and we still hang out.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work for me coming straight out of high school. The people we friendly and helpful. I learned a lot about stocking and organization.

good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and seeing different faces everyday. I met all sort of people when I was working there some couldn't even speak English.
good,I loved working as a jewelry coordinator I learned to work with more employees .  I love to keep my area clean make my showcases look great. I did not like to keep my customers waiting to long.  So took care of my customers in a proper way but also fast paced.  my part favorite of the job is seeing a happy customer.
good,"I learned a lot. I have the best co-workers, the hardest part of the job is the rude customers. The best part of the job is the customers."

good,A Typical day would assisting customers and helping people with their items. a learn how to communicate with other much better and how to be responsible and dependable. the management was good they really put there employees for first. the co-workers was very diverse which was good because you get to meet new people
good,Walmart is a great place to meet new people and learn opportunities for advancement. My co-workers were all around nice and very helpful. I learned from my managers that there is always room for improvement.
good,"The work is easy, but you do not get much training. Their lunches are longer than any other job I have had in the past. Walmart provides benefits for both full-time and part-time employees even though they tend to only higher part-time employees."
good,Workng at WalMart was a hassle. I was everywhere. I knew every department. I even had regular customers who would come at least 4 times a week just so i could help them. my managers was nice but co-workers was better.
good,i really enjoyed working at Walmart. The only thing is they don't have competitive wages. Walmart will train you for a variety of jobs within.
good,"Great place to get a good work out. If your metabolism agrees with you and you have a heavy duty area to work (water isle, pets, hardware). The management is 50/50 on being good or not. You can normally tell who got to the top on their knees and who actually worked their way to the top through hard work. The co-workers are normally like family, cause you have to stick together or the people from the other shifts will bad mouth you and talk about how much work you never do."
good,Working with the public can be tough at times but as long as you have a great altitude you can get along with anyone. I worked for this company soon after having my son. The people were really great to work with and the hours were very flexible.
good,"I would go into work, retrieve my sections inventory, stock shelves fully, clean up my section. store employees were friendly with upbeat attitude. advancement in store was minimal."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers I just did not enjoy not being able to work in other departments. I wish there were more options for sections to work in.
good,"While I was with Wal-Mart, I moved around a bit so I could understand how it all worked. Like which areas did what and how to get it done the right way. I started in shipping and receiving and there I load the trailers as fright came down the belt. Was a must to watch for damaged freight, Needed to be a fast consecutive pace.Then went into cross dock and that's when I would unload and load freight with fork lift and clamp, slip and reach. We would use RF scanners for the orders and skew numbers and slots."
good,"Working at the warehouse is hard work but the pay is worth the time and effort. Conditions in the warehouse are dependent on the weather, it could be extremely hot in the summer or freezing cold in the winter. Walmart has a sense of cohesiveness between the employees. There are always fun events going on every month. The number one thing Walmart is about is SAFETY."
good,Its not the easiest place to work.  But if you can hold on and wade through the muck its a secure job.  Decent benefits as well.
good,empresa segue todas as normas e remunera e da benefícios a seus colaboradores
good,"A typical day I would clock in, and go to start to push carts all day. It was my first job, so I learned how to communicate with customers and interact with them. Management was in order. The only thing I have to say about that, is whenever you asked management something it took them weeks to answer you back. My co-workers were some good people, some of them did their job very nice, and some didn't do their job at all and you had to do double your job to pick up their slack. The hardest part of my job was pushing carts, cleaning bathrooms, unloading the trucks, and helping cash register all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to ride the motorized carts back into the store."
good,"A very successful company that has been able to adjust to the ever changing retail climate. Always searching for the top talent, from upper level executives to sales associates."
good,"Wal-mart is just like any other retail chain. Heavy customer service based, along with stocking merchandise. Its not a bad place to work."

good,"This was my favorite job, because they worked with my school and work schedule. The only complaint I had was a few managers did not know what they were doing and ended up putting me in a bad spot. Anyways I left due to the horrible management that was there."
good,"Dealt with customers"
good,"Era normalmente bom, exceto quando alguns queriam se aparecer,na medida do possível eu aperfeiçoei o meu conhecimento na área de manutenção, principalmente com pessoas que vieram prestar serviços na loja, a gerencia nem estava aí, só sabia cobrar e por defeito no trabalho, os colegas eram na maioria todos simpáticos e cooperadores, a parte mais difícil era aguentar a direção e alguns lideres, a parte mais agradável do trabalho era o convívio com os colegas, pessoas muito bom de se trabalhar junto."
good,"In enjoy working with patients, edeucating them, assisting them with their choices.  There is no typical day, each day is different.  this is what I enjoy.  It does not get boring. I am able to get continued education through on lines courses (topOptician.com)"
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart is a productive day. My job as a customer service representative gave me the opportunity to satisfy customers on a regular bases .I learned that people will continue to do business with you with something as small a greeting and a smile. Customers have to believe and feel that you care and want to service them and they wont have a problem coming back. My management at Wal-Mart provided me with a lot of wisdom and guidance to help me get through to disgruntle customers or people who just wasnt having a great day. My co-workers were very down to earth caring and loving.The hardest part of my job was leaving a good company although I enjoyed being around good people and helping good people.
good,"A typical day at work was sometimes busy. I've learned how to communicate, good costumer service. Management was friendly. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the unhappy costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people daily, and a way to pass time."
good,"Cresci muito no Walmart. Ingressei como advogada plena e saí como gerente."
good,"To begin the day, I had to figure out how much freight was left from the night before and begin taking it to the floor to stock. Once that was done, I had to pull items from the back room to bring to the floor to fill the empty shelves. I had to manage my sales and figure out where a problem might be and how to fix it. I also helped with training staff. I learned how to manage a department, including sales, and staff. Management was very busy the majority of the time, but still easy to talk to, even if they could not help right away. My coworkers were great and I helped train many of them. The hardest part of the job was trying to fit everything that was on our list, into one day. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and and knowing that I helped them make their day better and more productive."

good,"A typical day at Wal-mart consist of but not limited too... daily stocking and price changes, high esteemed customer service and inventory control.delegating task to team members and following up to ensure company standards are met in a timely manner. what iv'e learned working for Wal-mart is that communication is imperative in order  to be successful and there must be a high level of appreciation for your team members/co-workers for their success as well. The hardest part of the job is having to terminate someone, because progress and success has always been my primary goal for myself as well as my team members. having said that, the most enjoyable part of the job is motivating my team members to give there all and love what they do for a living,  the satisfaction of my customers shopping experience, getting to know them on a first name basis, having them return as regular customers, and commendation from our customers. It makes each day worth coming to work."
good,I enjoyed working in a wonderful environment with great peoples and wonderful management. I also enjoyed my job to the fullest.

good,I do really love my job at walmart. It is fast paced and I never get bored because I always have something to do. I do however have trouble being a student and working. Being in the medical classes means sometimes I have clinicals or events that arent on a set schedule that I can bring in and my employers dont always give me the days off that I need.

good,"My position was involved with the pilot program for the Back Office Support Services. There was a lot to learn for all of us, as the program was evolving during our whole work period.

I learned a lot about the Wal-Mart computer systems and a lot about being very adaptable."
good,I love working with the staff members and I love seeing my loyal customers each week. Clean and organized in the store. Great management team.

good,"It is a fast moving company with many employees and some opportunities to grow. The days are long but if you stay there long enough, it would all be worth it."
good,Typical day at work included stocking freight on the shelves. Zoning the products on the shelf to look presentable. Helping with cashiering when needed.  I learned about picking out freight from the bins in the backroom. Some management and co workers were easier to get along with than others like all places.
good,"My time at Walmart has taught me a lot about interpersonal co-worker relations. There is a certain culture about walmart that is very interesting. Almost as if the company itself fosters the idea that all of the employees are part of a group of friends. While this may or may not be true it most certainly feels like a slightly dysfunctional family. "
good,"I worked different departments in the Gallipolis Walmart, from loading gravel and mulch in Lawn and Garden to Unloading trucks and working in the storage area of merchandise. I learned how to be courteous, friendly, take responsibility, lead, help both co-workers and customers, multi-task, work under pressure and short time scales, to be effective and maintain the condition of sensitive and breakable merchandise. Hardest part of the job I worked under was unloading two or three freight trucks for the holidays in area barely large enough to hold two full trucks worth of freight. I enjoyed my job though it was a challenge to me to push myself beyond my limits. I liked my co-workers we go along well and worked well as collaborative team."
good,"Working in Human Resources (or Personnel as Walmart calls it) in a busy store was something new to me. The employees were very friendly and helpful. "
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,For management you will have a good base salary with bonus potential but in most places some of the goals and expectations are lofty.  If you can put your team in the right place then you will be fine.
good,There are many different departments to work in so there is always an opportunity to explore new environments.  The job lets you express your work ethic.  I enjoyed working with many different people and helping the costumers.
good,"Ambiente laboral muy dinámico y responsable, claro sin perder de vista su objetivo"
good,"I loved this job so much because I was able to work with so many different people. It was very easy to adapt because I am very familiar with popular culture. I also learned how to run a department on my own, and I was also allowed to handle keys to valuable merchandise."
good,Great work environment for a hard working individual.  Many careers available.  Good compensation and benefits and a decent work life balance.
good,"A great place to learn just how much a customer means to the store.  "
good,"Wal-mart has price matching, which can make it very difficult to judge a persons character especially when trying to maintain a quick accessible line in order to keep the line moving. Wal-mart at most times is very busy. Sometimes people are just in a bad mood. Besides the few bad eggs, Wal-mart was a high quality job for the moment I was working there and would go back in a heart beat if it weren't for another streak of bad luck. Management was of the utmost quality work was the main focus but the customers may have suffered to some of the unhappiness and stress laid on employees due to undeserved lack of pay. I personally was not complaining a bit, I had previous experience with using a cash register so my pay grade was what I deserved it to be for a cashier but as an overnight employee, moving as much product as we did and still with an extra dollar an hour I was struggling to keep up. Receiving $10.25 nearly a dollar more than every other employee hired on night shifts and the work in my opinion was exhausting. I was also working another job at this point while taking part time classes at JJC but everybody there had the same amount of responsibilities, if not more, was about 20% faster than I, and getting paid a dollar less for night shift. I didn't fit in. I soon went back to cashier and got fired, deserving for call offs but deep down fired for the wrong reason. A pure accident."
good,I enjoyed Wal-Mart very much. They were very nice and the employees were great. The only problem I had was they don't really care if something happens to your children and you have to miss work because of being a single parent or if a family member passes and you have to take off work to deal with arrangements and family things.
good,It is a good place to work if you need a job that will keep you for a long time. Good and nice people to help with things you need.
good,Work load questionable at times.  There are times when more people are needed for certain areas for success in finishing work loads.
good,"A typical day working at Walmart is very high paced. its usually always busy so your always on your feet. I learned ways to pass by time and to get good reviews from customers which helped in getting raises and bonuses at work. Management at Walmart could be a little better but overall they get the job done. Co-workers in all work areas can sometimes be hard to work with but you must have the ability to put that aside to get the job done and done well. The hardest part of the job is managing the area after closing, but on the flip side the most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with my customers."
good,"It is not bad to work at Wal-Mart although it appears hard to become a full time employee. "
good,"work started out with working any new items into their areas then scanning through our area and pick any products that are out of stock that are back stocked. Any new notes from management should be done after and finished before lunch. After lunch, we assist customers and maintain our departments."
good,The day start with a meeting after the meeting we go out and zone the store after that I start on clean the floor until first break after that clear the parking lot of carts after back to clean the floors
good,I love working with people and Walmart is an awesome place to do this. Enjoyed every job assigned to me. Management changes periodically which gives you the opportunity to learn tasks in different ways.
good,"faire du réaménagement des modules, suivre les plans. "
good,Provided costumer service by greeting all costumers in a pleasant manner and assisted costumers with a wide knowledge on select styles of jewelry and watches. Assisted customers with bagging and loading of their merchandise and handled money.
good,"Working at Walmart was a fun experience for the most part. Most days went good when my bags were stocked and the costumers were polite, but when you get the rude costumers then that is where the day went a little bad because I felt bad because I could not provide them with the services they wanted. Most of management was good there was a few that just wanted to prove themselves or disregarded the rules. The hardest part was working with messed up bags during a rush because it was really hard to even get the bags to open because they had been recycled so many times. I had fun with my co-workers they were all nice people and I really enjoyed that part. I ended up learning allot about how to work a cash register and how to improve my costumer service skills. Overall it was a good experience."
good,"Capturacion de Datos"
good,"Walmart is a great place to develop skills for managing and leading."
good,"I like working at Wal*Mart. I've made some great friends, amazing accomplishments and a better work ethic. My management team is always there when I need them. If I don't know something, I can simply ask them and they will demonstrate the correct response. My coworkers are some of the best and funniest people I've ever met. They are reliable, great workers. They make working in the general public much easier some days. The hardest part of jewelry is everything and nothing at the same time. There are things that are common sense and there are things that I simply am not good at. Ordering a class ring, for instance. I cannot grasp that. ( My manager was not able to instruct me on that step.) The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that my customers leave my counter happy and satisfied knowing that their ring or earrings, necklace etc. was taken care of."
good,Pues buen ambiente de trabajo y capacitaciones continuas y promociones de subir puestos.
good,"there was never anything typical at this job always some new to learn or do. i learned how a big corperation was ran, and how to use this knowledge to better improve my work ethic. almost all the managers were nice i loved our store manager Sam he was very understanding and would help you anyway he could. but certain managers like the assistant cashier manager, and the jantioral manager would talk behind your back if you werent the same race as them. hardest part was dealing with those two for a while till i asked for a different department then it became the most enjoyable part of my job"
good,I actually enjoy working here at times and other times its really messy days. I love my manager personally but I dislike the restrictions against minors because if you ask me that is discrimination upon someones age.
good,Work on cars from the time we open until we close. I learned how to better help customers and there needs as well how to work on cars. The management was alright until the switched our assistant managers and the new AM had no idea what he was in control of so that's the reason I left because of his power and to tell us what to do. Hardest part was the heat and possibilities of burning yourself from oil or the engines. Co workers i wouldn't trade them for the world they helped me learn new things and showed me ways to make my job and day enjoyable. the Best part of the job was i was working in an outdoor style environment but still helping customers.
good,"Walmart had great co-workers, and management was always available. I enjoyed my supervisors and crew members. Work could get hard at times but it was never anything unbearable."
good,"Job was good. Good pay, decent schedule if you can handle 12 hours swing shifts, but the rotating two and three days off was great. Definitely one of the more interesting jobs I've had."
good,"A typical day at work would be filling between 600-800 perscriptions."
good,"Los horarios"
good,"Working for Walmart was an great experience, it enhanced my retail experience, I have always worked in retail, I am truly a people person. Walmart had a lot of customers daily so every experience is different . Our  management team was awesome. My only complaint about Walmart is that I worked there for three years and didn't get offered a full time position, I am now and always have been looking for a job that would turn into a career, a long time job."
good,"A typical day at Walmart Inc as an hourly supervisor consists of opening store, staffing departments, ensuring shipments arrive and are unloaded properly, and ultimately meeting the needs of the consumers. I learned a lot about what makes a huge industry function, how to work with upper management while training and cultivating new hires and helping them achieve their career dreams. The hardest part of the job is the relentless hours that managers spend in the store, especially during holidays and evening hours. I found the most enjoyable part of the job being given the opportunity to travel to other store in inventory/stocking crisis and helping the store as a whole recover back to a properly functioning business through re-training and interventional methodology."
good,"When working for Walmart, come expecting to work in a fast paced environment. You will learn the essence of patience and multitasking as you are called to do a number of jobs that maybe outside of your job description."
good,"Management did not treat employees with proper respect. And, did not provide employees with the proper equipment to complete tasks"
good,Overall i like working here but I am looking for something to better my career and a little more pay is great. I learned that standing on your feet can overwhelm you. My co-workers are very friendly and nice sometimes fussy but easy to get along with.
good,"I would go to the back of GM Receiving and start unloading the semi trailer with my co-workers. After I was done unloading the trailer, I would take a fifteen minute break (Walmart policy) and go back to GM Receiving to sweep off the trailer. When I was done with that I would take an hour lunch (Walmart Policy) and when I was done with my lunch I would pull out the pallets from GM Receiving and start helping stock the freight that I pulled out. "
good,A typical day would start off with a slow morning so cleaning the registers and surrounding areas would be first. then as the rush of customers begin so does the demand for the pace of our work but not in a bad way. the managers for the front end did make sure we had our proper breaks and lunches throughout the day. I wouldn't say there was a hardest part of the job.
good,it was a nice place to work very friendly coworkers. The worst part of working was the walking and all the strange people that try to stalk you
good,"Walmart es una empresa multinacional a donde da apoyo a chicos de empleados en una capacitacion de ""mi primer trabajo"";cada 6 meses hace una evalucion para poder subir de puesto segun el promedio que saques estas capacitada para ese puesto. Yo particularmente me llevo muy bien con todos los gerentes y cuando necesitan ayuda en su sector siempre me llaman ya que conozco el manejo de casi todo el lugar, ya sea electro donde se maneja mucha plata ya que se hace ventas y pagos, en recurso donde se maneja papeles y evaluciones de cada empleado, alcachofi donde se maneja directamente la plata que se reune en todo el dia, atencion al cliente donde se manejan las quejas de los clientes, cambios y devoluciones."
good,"I enjoyed my time on overnights as a stocker in the freezer, pets, sports, and hardware automotive."
good,it was a summer time job. I liked being around people and also being able to help those in need. Walmart was an overall good place to work
good,"Wal-mart, while it has a great employee culture and flexible hours. However there is only occasional opportunity for advancement."
good,"*A typical day would be organizing merchandise in their correct area and stock them on their rightful shelf. A lot of carrying of boxes some, may be heavier then other. "
good,"Most of the Managers were there to help you if you had any questions. Others were there to try and get the employees they didn't like fired."
good,I used to stock merchandise on the hardware department and customer service.I learned many things. I had good relation  with the management and co-workers. The harderst part of the job was to have many bosses. The benefits were a good thing.
good,"•	Always rated above average on annual performance reviews."
good,"Benefits were big, saving money. Management expects a lot out of the associates that are spread to thin in the departments."
good,"me gusta por la experiencia que adquieres con los clientes por que cada uno son diferentes,la verdad el ambiente es bueno pero a veces depende de las personas encargadas y el ambiente se vuelve muy agobiante muy pesado lo se por que los mismos clientes lo sienten y te lo comentan y  como trabajador a veces no trabajas a gusto,"
good,"When  you work for a cooperation like the size of Walmart, things sometimes get dropped or lost in the translation and you lose that feeling that you're definitely working in you local five and dime, but at the store where I worked, my co-workers made that difference up."
good,"Pros:"
good,"There would always be something different every day coming to the back room on what needs to be worked what needs to be put for storage. Every day is a challenge to doing your job like for example, squeezing your way through tight spots to get to a bin or carefully taking merchandises out of bins without knocking the other stacked merchandises down like a game of Jenga. Through those tough times the enjoyable parts were that there would be a little music that every co-worker in the back would agree to listen to. Speaking of co-workers they're not that bad to worker with at all just get to know there type of attitude is all, and that also goes towards management as well. From my times there what I learned from Walmart is there are good times and struggles, but with hard effort comes knowledgeable reward for not just with work, but out of work."
good,"I worked at walmart for three years, and near the end I was feeling really stressed out. The benefits were hard to say goodbye to. My work was also under renovations which led to the stress."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of taking care of customer needs and helping fellow associates."
good,Worked around my schedule during high school. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers
good,great place to learn and build as an individual and as a team player as well.
good,I worked 3rd shift for Wal-Mart. I was in charge of stocking new materials and organizing shelves. I learned how to multi-task at this job. The management was great at this job. This was one of the best jobs i had in my life. I love the hours and i enjoyed my co-workers. We had good times working with each other. No complaints!!
good,"me encargaba desde el recibo hasta el embarque con dos de tres supervisores"
good,"wal mart warehouse was a decent place to work, great pay, hard work, 3-4 days off. "
good,always enjoyed the fellowship if my crew and the free dinners for having so many safe days was always a plus. My  managers was a good group of people to work for. From time to time they would have  a BBQ for all the employees for doing a great job and for us reaching our safety goal. For most of the time this was a great group of people to work for.
good,"Something different happened everyday. I was working in different departments inside of the store that I loved. I learned that I made the difference in someone's life that could have probably changed their life or how they feel about those that work in such stores. Management to me was constantly busy and I think it could have been better for me to have seen the management team take more concern to their employees. Some co-workers are awesome to work with but others not so much, some are unprofessional after they get the job. The hardest part about my job was...I don't even know. But the most enjoyable part of my job was that I had fun at being professional and caring."
good,The company has great people working within the company that work great together. The people within the company always have your back.  The company is a strong retailer that is achieving excellence in their food areas.
good,job entitle stocking the shelves with the merchandise that came in on the truck the management was not very good to many managers with every one telling you do what they want and not the other one they didn't even tell the other mangers that they were taking their worker for something else the other employees if they were there longer then you they thought the were the boss over the newer people
good,I was fortunate enough to have a great management team. The only bad thing about it is the pay is not too great. They are very flexible with your availability which was a major plus for me.
good,"I just working for Walmart DC, great pay and benefits plus you meet alot of great people. The company's moral however seems quiet low... apparently I'm one of very few who enjoyed my time working with the company."
good,I enjoyed being part of Walmart. It is a fun workplace to part of because it is a positive environmental company. I have learned a lot working for this company. I feel like working here gave me the experience to be a team player and a people person.
good,"i hated working at walmart. They under pay and under staff. when it is time to pul a truck i had to rotate the morning shift milk, cheese, ect. plus pull in over night stock."
good,"En mi sección el ambiente es agradable, somos pocos asi que nos afiatamos bien."
good,"Everyday was fairly basic working for Walmart.  We unloaded two trucks, stocked product, emptied pallets and kept everything clean and organized. My coworkers were fun to work with, but it was a stressful environment."
good,"I think everyone who has every worked in Customer Service would agree that dealing with the public is hard and very stressful. It's difficult being a cashier anywhere, not because the actual job is hard, but because it's a challenge pleasing everyone that comes down that line. At the end of the day, after being yelled at, insulted, and disrespected, it's hard to find anything worthwhile or enjoyable but I found that my coworkers and the friendly atmosphere makes all the trouble worth it. I know that if I need help I can call my CSM or the closest cashier and they'll help me just like I'll help them. Even though we're alone at our registers with our customers, we use team work to get the job done and to solve any problems that come down any of the aisles."
good,in a typical day of work i would clock in and check with my manger/supervisor regarding the work load for the day. Usually this involved restocking the shelves with the missing or low items forthe shelve areas.
good,"I would help prepare the backroom by setting it up for the trucks we were to unload. I would help unload the grocery trucks, frozen and diary trucks. After building the pallets I would help pull the pallets full of product out onto the sales floor for the night stockers to put on the shelves. I really enjoyed working with the co-workers that were assigned on my shift. Everyone got along and helped each other out. The hardest part of my job was pulling the pets pallets out because they were so heavy, but I did it."
good,"was an ok job for the age i was, i made good money there an enjoyed going to work there. There were a lot of good co-workers there."
good,"A typical day started with me restocking the egg cartons and milk coolers then moved on to doing picks(taking items from the backroom to the store floor) and restocking items on the sales floor running low. "
good,deal with weather a lot ! deal with a lot of customer issues. job had a lot of satisfaction to it. Some dept. managers need help with displays and you could help them
good,"Enjoyed working the register, and dealing with the various typed of customers!"
good,"The only bad thing I could say about working at Wal-Mart was them cutting my hours. I loves the people I worked with the the great people that shopped there made my day. Im going to miss working there very much, Management were pleasant to me but I also did my job so there was no reason for them to dislike me. A typical day at work was busy always lines but I loved it time went fast, If you like people cashier at Wal-Mart  is a awesome job meet so many people that you end up becoming friends with. Ill miss being the Wal-Mart girl."
good,"a typical day as an walmart associate consist of working in many different departments, consistent customer service and steady inventory management ."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart it was a nice shop awesome benefits but management was very poor
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you plan to make it your career, but if not its something to keep an income until you find your career."
good,Was a good job. Co-workers all worked together for a common goal. I enjoyed interacting with customers and giving them the best customer experience possible. I learned to handle customers issues and to work with a sense of urgency to accomplish a goal.
good,Wal Mart is a fast pace job that requires a lot from there employees.  Advancement opportunity is possible for those who are willing to pretend they like certain members of management.  The management team is horrible.  They treat you like you are children with no understanding.  I feel the employees are under paid considering all the work they are asked to do.
good,i check out people and put returns away. i also pushed carts because they could nnot keep cart pushers. we made sure they floors stayed cleared
good,"The problem when I worked is that I truly did not get trained, just shown what to do when neede. Also a co-worker was periodically late getting to work as well as coming back from lunch."
good,"I Liked the people i worked with, the management could have been a little better, the hardest part was to try and get everything stocked before the next shift arrived, I did learn to have more patience in the work that i am doing. A typical day at work was to get there find out which departments i had to stock then get to it."
good,"I enjoy working with Walmart. Coming in to see the merchandise. Cleaning Zoning prepare front end to be seen by customers. While completing those tasks your doing price checks, overrides controlling money flow whether with pulls or giving change. Maintaining front end coverage. Accepting customer complaints and comments as well as trying to maintain customer satisfaction."
good,Lift many pounds of fright an hour. You have to work hard to get paid hard. Supervisors leave you to do your own work at your own pace. Co-workers stay out of your way. Getting the task done in a timely manner takes skill and great focus. The money is awesome.
good,"Monitorear los componentes en el proceso de generacion de masa"
good,I'm just starting this job this month but it seems like a good place to be and continue building experience for my career.
good,"a typical day at work would just consist of ringing customers up, and great friendly interactions. They did a good job of staying on top of making sure people received breaks if those were going without being given."
good,"Most days are stress free,stay positive with co-workers and the hardest part of the job is the training issues"
good,"A typical day as a sales associate in the toys department is to organize and make sure the department looks good and is easy to navigate, to put back items where they go, and to assist customers in finding exactly what they need. The management was great, always willing to help and answer any questions their associates had with extreme patience. The co-workers were good as well hoping to make friendly connections with eachother so as to make the work more enjoyoable. The hardest part of the job is completing all of the tasks at hand in the time provided while also attending to the customers needs, especially around the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work at my own pace to get everything done without having to worry about the managers breathing down my neck."
good,ruff days but short hours depending on season. Its ok company and i had over 10 years with them.
good,Wal-Mart was a great place to work. Always something fun to do and something challenging everyday. Although their were a lot of miscommunication with management regarding breaks and lunches.
good,"A maior empresa do mundo no segmento de varejo, dentre os colegas de trabalho, bom relacionamento. Devido a responsabilidade de si manter no topo existe uma grande pressão sobre os gerentes de departamento mas, tudo com objetivo comum de alcançar as metas proposta pela empresa e manter o bom atendimento buscando a excelência sempre com muito respeito ao indivíduos."
good,"Walmart was a fun and relaxed work environment, management and colleagues are respectful and courteous. While working at Walmart I learned a lot about people interaction and how best to deal with sticky situations. The hardest part of Walmart is dealing with those 1 in a 100 crazy shoppers, which I'm sure all of us have seen at some point, you need to maintain a cool and level head and just do your best to defuse the scenario. My favorite aspect of my past Walmart experience was the satisfaction i got from a job well done and the appreciation I felt from the customers I served. Working there for 4 years or so I really felt like a part of something special, I'd have my regular customers who became more like my friends."
good,"My day usually starts at 7 am. First thing I do is determine what needs to be done for the day, i.e... Is there anything left undone from 3rd shift, gathering items that need to be returned to their specific modular home and basic organization. Then I would get my Gemini (a handheld device Wal-Mart utilizes for keeping up with inventory process and price changes) and scan the product that is low or has been sold out to ensure more is coming on the next truck or to ensure the inventory is accurate. After that process (or during) I get my instruction from upper management and add the things that I have found that need to be done (if workload and time permits). At that point I determine which associate is assigned to what job and what time. Then its execute. I follow up on progress, give instruction where needed and help execute the assignments when needed. Before leaving for the day I ensure that the next shift that comes to work has adequate assignments. I will communicate with one or more of them through notes or in person. "
good,"eu gostava de trabalhar no walmart mais era as pessoas que faziam o ambiente ficar ruin "
good,"great work place for learning and getting the amount of knowledge and responsibility given a Manager."
good,it was a fun job i really liked it there they do a good job with scheduling and i think pay was fair for what i was doing. there where allot of benefits to the job you could take advantage of also
good,"Loved the team, very nice managers and awesome work experience. One of my favorite jobs to say the least. Everyone was friendly and hard working. It also gave me a boost in my customer service skills."
good,"On a normal day opening I will run the high priority freight that is locked up to the sales floor and secure the items. This is followed by daily audit of theses items to ensure inventory is up to date. Then I will follow assigned task handed down by management while still assist guest  throughout the day.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the sometimes overwhelming amount of freight that we can receive but this can be combated with a structured plan throughout the day."
good,"You will assist customers in finding products.  You will keep the shelves stocked and organized.  You can learn various electronic tools for merchandising such as the Gemini hand-held computer.  You may occassionally be asked to help with transferring merchandise from the stockroom to the floor.  Walmart has firm policies but it's not hard to learn them and with hard work and applying yourself you can succeed."
good,"A typical day at work   was try to successfully help the public with what ever they needed."
good,"the days are long ,the pay is good and the work is easy.always learning .I've done a lot of differant jobs there and I dont think there is one I didnt like.I always got along with my co-workers."
good,"Exelente ambiente de trabajo, depende el departamento y compañeros de trabajo, aprendes mucho en las capacitaciones para cualquier siniestro ademas de como actuar y tratar a las personas que entran en panico."
good,"Not a bad place to work , there are long hours but the pay is good . The people there are rather friendly . I wouldn't call it difficult."
good,"The small town Walmart I have worked for was, predictably, full of people who knew each other even outside of the workplace. Our children went to the same schools, we attended personal events of our fellow associates, we knew their anniversaries, whether they were sick, when they had children, etc. We cared about one another, laughed with them, cried with them, shared ""war"" stories. We were like family, and that is one thing that the city stores don't have. And that is one reason why some of those same associates are still there. There was real company support there."
good,"Chegamos para abrir a loja e logo na abertura sofremos um assalto, alguns associados em panico.conseguimos manter a tranquilidade deles e esperar que aquilo se acabasse, terminando fizemos os processos necessarios para continuar com nosso dia e buscar nossas metas,Apreendir que nessas adversidades e que conhecemos nossa equipe, pois uma hora apos o ocorrido parecia que nao havia acontecido nada, pessoas motivadas e engajadas mostrando que o que mais valia naquele momento era a entrega de todos em busca de nossas metas.Sobre meus superiores tbm tivemos todo o apoio necessario.A parte mais dificil nesses anos de empresa foi ter que mudar de loja e deixar uma familia, pois em todas as lojas que passei meus associados conseguiram ter uma leitura muito boa daquilo que eu e a empresa esperava deles.E a parte mais agradavel que passei nesta empresa e em muitas loja que gerenciei foi ver a equipe ganhar o bonus pago pela empresa por resultados alcancados."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you are use to working in a fast paced enviroment and can keep up with your daily production. Co-workers where great to work  with.
good,Great place to work. It's a great place to grow as a person both professional and personally.
good,They don't work with their  employees if they have a disablilty.
good,"Fellow associates are great, it can be a fun place, other than management"
good,"On Stepped Retail Management Course"
good,"Manejaba una ajenda de visita diaria ya que tenia 13 tiendas a mi cargo, visitaba por lo menos 2 al dia, los dias de nomina generalmente solo una, llegaba, checaba la imagen y uniforme de los trabajadores, checaba sus incidencias (faltas, incapacidades, vacaciones, permisos, retardos), En caso de que la unidad a visitar tuviera una vacante, dedicaba 2 horas a entrevistas y aplicacion de pruebas, Checaba los expedientes por si no tenian algun pendiente, como aniversarios, vacaciones, o algun permiso firmado para considerarlo en la Nomina, Programaba sus capacitaciones de puesto o de brigada, hacia lo mismo en la 2a unidad a visitar."
good,Enjoyed working in that environment. Co workers were kind and helpful. Disappointed that the vehicle aspect of Walmart was removed from stores.
good,"O meu dia de trabalho é muito dinâmico, atuo em dois setores administrativo, gosto muito do que faço."
good,"Lo que aprendí:"
good,"entrada de 6 A 2 con 40 minutos de comida actividades dirías"
good,"En una empresa como esta es fácil trabajar nos da muchas herramientas para lograr crecer como personas y en base a números, lo malo de esta es que nos come con muchas horas extras que no son pagadas y un mal salario"
good,"I feel that a typical day at work can be annoying with the overhead cameras watching your every move.   When a common mistake is made they are there to give out bad checks on your record but the minute a customer gives you a compliment to management,no good check is made.  I give my co-workers (most of them)a 5 star for putting up with upper cashier management.  Although I feel that I really enjoyed the customers I had in both stores.  As I feel the GOOD customers always make the bad ones I forget about!"
good,"I worked at Walmart for a little over 3 years. starting as a stocker and had held different positions over time. I worked as a cashier, lawn and garden and customer service. I worked an 35-40 hours per week. I learned that with Walmart I had job security. I enjoy working around people and get along with most everyone. I really didn't feel that there was a hard part in any position I held, as I knew what my job responsibilities would be each time I worked a different area. I enjoy working; I enjoy working around people and helping customers. Management was good, they were very understanding while I was going to school full time and working full time. They were understanding when I could no longer do both. The only thing I didn't like was that I worked every weekend. I didn't get very much family time with working  different hours."
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable. I learned customer service skills, how to maintain perfect organization, how to satisfy the customers needs and wants, how to stock the merchandise properly, and how to use the telzone for item that was not located on the sales floor. The management is very caring they make sure that the employees are trained very well and that if we are not able to give the customer an answer they will provide an answer for them. The co-workers are very easy to get along with and they are very nice not only to the customers but to other associate's as well. The hardest part of working in the Ims department was packing merchandise in the areas that didn't have any more space to put them but as hard workers we all found a way to make it work. The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-mart was my schedule it worked for me."
good,"It is not a terrible company to work for, though it does feel that Walmart could easily fix many of its problems by simply hiring more staff."
good,"In Walmart, my highest remark would have to be job security.  If you are willing to show up to work everyday, they'll keep you.  However if you show up sick you run the risk of getting fired more easily.  To put it simply, Walmart isn't going anywhere anytime soon. "
good,"leaning new things "
good,"A typical day at work is consistency. You are always doing something, if not in your own department, in some one else's. I have learned patience, respect,and how to keep a smile in spite of any situation. Management is ok, but there are times when they forget that you are a human being with feelings. I think its because of the working hours that store operate, 24/7. My co-workers are bsaically like myself, come to work with a smile, because its the start of the day and we all know what is expected and what to expect. I enjoy my co-workers, we survive with each other. The hardest part of my job is not being able to spend time with my kids when they come home for the holidays. Other than that there is no hard part. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have left a smile on some customer's face at the end of the day."
good,"Decent Management with Good Overall Associate Relations, Good Benefits"
good,"Great place to work, I worked midnights so it was bit harder for me trying to adjust to sleeping. They was very easy going about my military career and gave me no trouble."
good,"I was a supervisor for walmart for over 2 years.most of the time it wasnt a bad place to work for. you got a safety bonus, employee discount and i made lots of friends."
good,"I operated a cash register and provided customer service whenever needed. I learned close to all job titles on the sales floor. I made many friends with co-workers and management. It could become difficult during a rush, but was rewarding to finish the day and make it through it."
good,A very demanding and high paced place of business. Rewarding on the mid management level. Chances to compete against regional and company wide arenas. If able to excel in the company recognition and appreciation was rendered. Because so competitive the work load often ran into personal time causing you to sacrifice home life. Not always easily understood by all. Due to so many hours one can form a family like atmosphere at work. This was the best part of the job. The friends and contacts made at work.
good,"ótima empresa que preza pelos seus colaboradores,e da condições de trabalho para serem feitas as tarefas diárias ."
good,at work if you get your job done faster would be the good thing to do for everybody
good,Wal-Mart has a tendency to overlook the potential in their current employees.  But the pay is more than competitive in our area.
good,I liked working there I was able to get my work done and I liked most of the people.
good,"Dia bastante dinâmico, e com novidades."
good,"Over all, I do love working for Walmart, I love the interaction with the customers, I love the non-stop change and constantly moving and doing things. Great management team at the Clinton store, and awesome work team. They appreciate there workers which I think is very important to get more productivity out of people. I like how we change things out and its not the same thing day in and day out, so each day is like an adventure, never know what will happen that day until you clock in for the day."
good,I have learned alot of stuff to use in my future jobs. i just listen to the bosses and have enjoyed my time with them
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience. Interacting with and helping customers is what I do best. I was also recognized many times for my services. Coworkers and managers were also like family. But in the end, it paid too little to make a living. I highly recommend this employer to younger workers wanting to gain experience and senior workers wanting to make some extra money"
good,"I enjoyed my job, learned a lot, hardest part of the job was that my schedule was different every day of the week.  A typical day was filled with a variety of responsibilities."
good,"Enter Electronics and Photo Center departments, put new stock out, clean and zone areas,  package new pictures."
good,Not a bad place to work as long as you do your work. you do get stuck fixing other employee's mistakes if your someone they know they can rely on.
good,Wal-Mart was very lenient yet fun. I've learned working at Wal-Mart how to multitask.
good,"The typical day simply involved assisting customers in the store, and manning the till."
good,walmart is a good company to work for however at this time i would like a change
good,Overall I had a good experience working here. The people were very kind and helping. It is very easy to advance your position with hard work.
good,"Working for this company has made me very knowledgeable about being a technician. although I worked for almost 2 years as a tech, I can honesty say I have learned so much."
good,"Can be very easy to move up fast in the company. Your restrictions are the ones you put on yourself. Can be a very high paced, stressful job if you move to management and above. Hours will vary depending on deadlines and include graveyard shifts, swing shifts, and sometime split shifts. High organizational skills and ability to handle stress is a must."
good,I enjoyed working for Wal*Mart. You get to meet so many different people. This was a great starter job for me because when I started here I had very little work experience. I ended up working for this company for 7 years and it was great. My co-workers were fun. I learned how to bag groceries in the best way! I always got great customer compliments for that. Management was understanding when it came to needing time off and tried to work with you. The hardest part of the job was always having to be there when I had family obligations.
good,"Depending on the day I would go into work and meet up with my manager to receive my tasks for the day. Work tasks vary from working freight, creating picks for the sales floor, retrieving picks from the back room, creating features or replacing old features, and ultimately providing excellent customer service. No matter what job customers always come first even if you have a hundred tasks you must complete in a day. If a customer needs help you stop everything and service them. Management is on top of all daily tasks and there for each team member as needed. Co-workers work as a team and if needed assist you to complete tasks at hand. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing how much you can do in a day and making a difference in the customer's life by helping them by: finding an item,  reaching a high item, going to the back and getting something we may be out of on the floor."
good,"My standard routine was to clock in and see if any customers needed assistance on the way to my areas, then find my supervisor. what happens next depends on my shift. "
good,Very good workplace for some who loves to help people overall I think this is a good company to work for.
good,"A typical day depends on the shift. I learned many things from dealing with customers to putting up freight at a fast pace. The management was good but sometimes the ""little"" associates under them were put on the back burner. All work places have some kind of drama that goes on behind the scenes but overall it wasn't that bad. The hardest part of the job was getting paid minimum wage to do a higher ups jobs for them. Many, many of times have I or other associates completed mods or tasks that should have been done by the Department managers or higher ups. The most enjoyable part was those times when I was acknowledged for all my hard work."
good,just like any other walmart not really strict come in get your work done and go home.
good,"Busy constantly, obtained certification for tires, and other medical duties."
good,My shift was full-time and I learned a lot about janitorial work and i got to work on my own and keeping the routine going.I remembered that I used to clean the break room and cleaning up the counters and sweeping it and mopping it and making sure the microwave oven was clean and it was an everyday thing. I also had to cleaned up the public restrooms at Wal-Mart and i used the baler machine to crushed many boxes. I had to follow instructions  while using the baler. I had to take out the garbage indoors and outdoors and I also did safety sweep all around the store. I also had to make sure the sales floor was clean and  I had to cleaned up the spills too. This was Walmart and I worked under the Maintenance  Department and i had a supervisor. There were 5 co worker of in that department. I had to make sure that the entire store was clean. I remembered that i set new liners for the trash bins and the hardest part of the job was cleaning up the warehouse because at first i partly swept the floor and i didn't do a good job but then i learned to do everything and done it right so it was a challenge but yet successful.What i enjoyed at Wal-Mart was that i got to meet some new people and i got to know them a bit.
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Nice peaceful place to work. I recommend others apply.
good,"Walmart global sourcing is a place where people are treated with utmost respect and individual's opinions are valued most."
good,"I learned how to help customers, I handled money stocked shelves certain managers were amazing."
good,"mi dia de trabajo era llegar limpiar mis articulos, escanear precios para saber si no habia cambios de precio llenar huecos  y surtir obviamente."
good,I typically come into work and start putting away product on the shelves.  I've learned that I need to do a little bit at a time to be more successful.  The management is competent and courteous most of the time.  My coworkers are caring and kind for the most part.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of the amount of work that needs to be done and the limited amount of time to do it in conjunction with the number of customers that are usually there.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help a customer find what they are looking for and help them get what they want.
good,"A typical day can be from one side of the store to the next to accomplish what needs to be done."
good,"put merchandise on sales floor, put price tags on merchandise."
good,It helps a person to gain skills and move up in the company. In order to move up a person needs to work hard and be dedicated.
good,"Always pressure from regional managers to get more exams and sales. The company does not advertise the vision center in mass media or have ""specials"" or give the vision center staff any incentive to do more than the minimum."
good,"I enjoyed this job because of the people that I encounted everyday. I was given the responsibility of being the safety team leader which put me in a postion the make sure the Associates and Customers were following procedure to keep the store from accidents. I worked closely with management. I learned key points on how the identify shoplifters, working the PTZ and Still shot cameras, and also filing and putting in cases with the Houston Police Department."
good,"The people I worked with were nice and friendly. I stayed busy, and got a the support I needed from management. I learned to pay close attention to detail. Hardest part fixing others mistakes. figuring out the problems and finding solutions to them."
good,By working there I became a better person as I lived alone and was amazed at how well I did for myself! I never asked anyone for anything!
good,"I have enjoyed working here for 9 years. I've learned so much...how to muti-task in a busy environment....my creative side has been a blessing to the photo center. My managers can count on me to make signs, posters, canvases, photo books for our store, as well as helping the customers create their gifts on the kiosks. I so enjoy the creative side to this job. "
good,"I started out liking the company and my manager. When I moved to another store, the environment became difficult. As with any job/company, some days and some managers are easier to get along with than others."
good,"Great company to work for as a starter job or seeking to move up through a company as progression can be quick as long as you work hard. The job consisted of mostly manual labor in large quantities, there were many times were the entire team would feel under payed."
good,"The management is difficult. The benefits were great, the pay is low, and the employees were fun but didn't understand the meaning of teamwork."
good,"En general es un empleo muy activo, dependiendo el área o departamento en el que te encuentres, aprendí a valorar el empleo de las personas en una tienda supermercado, y en especial en área de farmacia, las gerencias son organizadas y permite un fácil desempeño laboral, tenia compañeros que solo manejaban farmacia o afín, excelente compañerismo, la parte que mas me agrado es la capacitación constante, la parte mas difícil, fueron las jornadas laborales en cuanto horarios es un poco desorganizada."
good,"Was a very interesting place to work, with not having prior retail experience i was delighted to find the atmosphere and environment were a lot different than you would assume from just being a casual customer. I learned how to work well with several team members, Approximately 50-60 people of all different skill sets and positions. Being able to work in all of the departments available that were non grocery related really taught me a few things i had zero knowledge on before. The management was supportive in the beginning but my main gripe was that they were hiring and switching around new managers on the regular so i didn't have a good chance to get to know them which i feel would have improved the overall experience for many people. They often had different opinions and sometimes clashed with each other but at the end of the day we were still efficient and completed what we needed to."
good,It is a great job to have if you didn't have family. It's room to move up in the company but personally I think it all in who you know to move up. It is a nice and pleasant place to work. Most of the time everyone come together to make the job run smoothly. The hardest part of the job is when you have a job list to do and you can't finish b/c you have to be put in another position to make thing run smoothly. Leaving the job list on the back burner.
good,"Very physical job picking products for customer consumption in the stores.  The demand keeps you busy and productive.  The work is inside a freezer so it is best to stay moving so you stay warm and the day also goes by faster.  "
good,"a typical day at work involved working consistently in putting inventory up once unloaded from the trucks and pulled from the pallets, management was always available when i had a question or didnt know how to do something.  The co workers worked as a team to get the quota filled per say and get things ready for the morning shift.  The hardest part about this job was haveing to adapt to a late work schedule.  I enjoyed once i was comfortable with the shift change the overnight shift more than the day, not being rushed to put supplies up and dealing with a steady flow of customers"
good,"A typical day starts between 7:30-8:00 am.  You'll have an hour lunch most days, and the majority of the company leaves the office around 5:30. "
good,Management made the job very pleasurable. Lots of good energy and understanding.
good,"Being a stocker was fun, easy job.  It kept me busy and hours spend at work went by fast.  I learned the process of stocking, binning and continued with customer service. Management was good, willing to educate us as much as they could. The hard of the job was standing for long period of time.  I enjoyed working but I needed to look for a day job."
good,"My typical day at work allows me to interact with a lot of people and be a blessing to my coworkers. fortunately, I want to transition to a office type environment that will allow me to utilize my office skills."
good,This is a great place to work if you have no emotion or are deaf. The job is good for the most part. Make no mistake the company only looks out for themselves. If you can keep from being drug into the politics of this company it is a great job. Don't cause waves or ask questions.
good,I was an overnight stocker in the produce section. My hours were from 10 p.m. to 6:45 a.m. The work was fine and I enjoyed the people in my department.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company for as long as I did!
good,"working many years at the same company you get to know many aspects of store, really got to know my co-workers over the years and had fun with many. Although it can get very busy on week-ends and holiday sometimes that is when it was the most fun. Would prefer to have more respectful upper management it makes the job more enjoyable and I think respect for the individual is important."
good,"A typical day would be walking into the doors of walmart and clocking in. I work in the back room. We would get a hand held scanner to get picks. Picks is items that need to be sent to the sales floor to be stocked. After lunch it is time to bin all the freight that didn't get stocked or had enough room to be stocked. We do that until the day is over. I learned a lot of things, where everything went, how to bin, how to pick and how to learn all the settings on the hand held scanner. My co-workers are great people to work with. Everyone communicated good. The hardest part of the job was to be able to get everything binned in by 7am. There is days where lots of freight would come back to me."
good,"During my time with Wal-Mart I became PLE licensed to operate the electric pallet jack, used to obtain items stored high up in our backroom. Teamwork was a big part of a lot of the projects, which was very comforting when first entering a new work environment. The hardest time I had during this position was learning where each and every item was in the grocery section of the store."
good,This could be a great palce to work at.  You meet some amazing people and great friends.  Only downside is when you have someone in a management position who does not know what they are doing.
good,"I worked in 3 dept always something new,co-workers were great most boss great"
good,Changes are not always the best . Very aggressive and willing to do anything needed.
good,"I had a good time working with Walmart, making new friends, and helping people find what they are looking for, i had great pay and benefits, at a fast paced stocking job you'll expect to have some difficulty coping at first but once you get the hang of things it'll be as easy as snapping your fingers, but like all jobs there is some aggravation with troublesome people, a manager in a bad mood trying to keep company profits or meet certain deadlines, but i always  just thought of myself in their positions and understood, but i would recommend walmart to anyone"
good,My day is hectic due to poor communication between management and associates. Plus they don't know how to balance the work load nor do they really care. They have no idea what's going on in they're store.
good,"Each day had several responsibilities; stocking, inventory, cleaning. Among them the most prominent was customer service, answering questions, locating items, and sales. Co-workers where helpful, and working with people taught a lot of interpersonal skills. People that needed help, people that needed information, or simply conflict resolution when people could not be helped. Management changed fairly regularly, each with different expectations and responsibilities, each time it seemed like as soon as people had adjusted, the boss would change."
good,"Fazia abertura da loja,fazia circular de preços, pedia cartazes ao cartazista, lipeza e organização para a abertura da loja, abastecimento da loja..após estar tudo certo,ficava só na abordagem e atendimento. Aprendi muito com cada produto novo que chegava,fiz muitos amigos, companherismo."
good,"A typical day had its ups and down, whether it be that customer that throws you completely off or even a simple child giving you a big grin. I learned a great deal of tolerance and patience in the loud environment. Management, while more than often fair, seemed very biased in their decisions. Co-workers were there to help out when you asked. The hardest part would have been declining a customer of a transaction due to machine/card problems. I took great pleasure in helping a customer with even the simplest of things."
good,Wal*Mart is a good company to work for. the enviroment is very friendly
good,"Hours where flexable, I knew my schedule 3 week ahead, so planning things was not very hard"
good,"very nice people "
good,"I don't know about other Walmarts, but as far as the people at Batavia go, I very much enjoyed working with them.  Walmart policies can seem a little odd at times because of all of the lawsuits they're looking to avoid, but they aren't terribly overbearing."
good,A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and going to my assigned work station for the day. Greeting customers in the store and starting my job duties whatever they were that day. I liked working best in produce. My supervisor was amazing and funny. I loved going to work when she was there.
good,"the pay was good for the seven years I was there, I really don't have too much to say"
good,"I was responsible to unload the trucks, sort the items and stock the shelves."
good,"Delegating, follow up. Getting managers notes done. Ensuring best possible shopping experience for customers. Verifying deposits. Moving freight to the floor. Scheduling."
good,There was always something new to learn that made everyday interesting and fun. The people I worked with were great and made each day fun and productive.
good,"I had the opportunity to work multiple departments in the store, learning very much during the three years I was employed there."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work. Its nice working with the customers and its a chance to get to know the other employees.
good,"I loved working at walmart."
good,overall i give it four stars.it is a fun place to work. you get to meet different people everyday of the week. everyday is different. Enjoyed working with my co-workers they made the job a lot of fun.I think the hardest part is not being heard. most enjoyed making people smile whether its over the phone or in person
good,"You punch in and scan your badge. The screen tells you where to go and what to do. You do it. Simple. If no customers zone and clean. See if other cashiers need your assistance with a price check. Fill in candy displays that are at each register. You treat each customer how you would wish to be treated. "
good,"As soon as you get in, your on the move"
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to grow. The only problem I have is the fact that there is a lot of politics. I have seen people get promotions just because they were liked.
good,"Contractors really don't get the full benefits of Walmart Benefits, but it the benefits of Full Time associates sound pretty awesome"
good,"A typical day at work consist of running a register, putting up stock, and customer service"
good,Everyday was an adventure as shoplifters come to steal everyday. Each day was always a new one and you never know what to expect so I always went in preparing for the worse. I learned in a hostile enviroment you have to stay alert and calm at the same time always. Think before you act but know how when you do so. Management was there when needed for the most part if I needed assistance. I trained my co-workers since i was the lead of the security team. They were helpful and dependable whenever we worked together. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with irrate customers or shoplifters especially. It can be a very dangerously job for someone who isnt hand on or dont know how to be in demand. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to blend in any surroundings and stop so much shrinkage. Also going to different Wal-Mart locations to train and show others the basic skills needed for the position.
good,"very busy, the manager is semi cool. i love my co workers. the job is ok"
good,"A typical day at work, clock-in, review grocery ads (price matching) go to assigned register; take care of customers; only water allowed at register; when not busy keep work area clean and redline workarea; help other cashiers out by bagging groceries for them; 15 minute breaks every 2hrs. Working 6 plus hours included an hour lunch."
good,"A typical work day is just your normal retail experience, I learned several customer service traits, and the management was very easy to approach due to the ""open door policy.""  Co-workers are very family oriented, and the hardest part of the job has to be the varied work schedules, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the contribution to the community."
good,"Wal-mart is a great company to work for. They pay great and want you to earn every penny, which is a GREAT thing! management was good. co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was the heat in the wearhouse and heavy fright. The most enoyable part of the job, was training others and beating my quota."
good,Friendly co-workers/management. Not so friendly customers. Fast paced retail environment.
good,"As stocker what I do is very physical, hard work. My normal day I check into a job assignment tool then do whatever stocking I am assigned. As mod team member I changed sections of product all over the store I was required to read a plan o gram, print my new labels, use a Gemini scanner. I learned to bin product in the warehouse. I also learned to make a pick (needs) list for product needs."
good,We come in and pick and bin items in a timely fashion.  I learned to operate power lifting equipment as well as using the system with inputting items into it as well as outputting items.  Management would depend on me usually and were reasonable.  I usually was able to work with my co-workers without any incidents.  The hardest part of the job would be the redundancy of doing the same thing over and over again.  The most enjoyable part would be the end of the shift on nights.
good,Great Place to work its always busy which isn't a bad thing a lot of opportunity great staff members and paid holidays.
good,"The work is not hard at all. All you do is stock up freights, do inventory picks, zone products on sales floor, and help customers look for item. Since I have a technical background I usually answer some of the questions customers may have and also give them advice on which electronic would be most beneficial to them."
good,"Fun place to work, always interacting with new people."
good,"Great team work, wonderful people skills. I learned to drive the forklift and other electric equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job is on holidays and seeing the people of the community happy."
good,I enjoyed working with the public and the people that worked with me
good,"Busy 90-95% of the time, have great co workers and the enjoyable part my job is helping others. I love to solve problems. I can actually say that there aren't any very difficult parts of the job,"
good,"I found Wal-Mart to be a decent place to work.  My direct supervisor was knowledgeable and answered my questions.  I enjoyed my co-workers and we worked as a team.  We did not have air-conditioning , but we had over-head heaters for the winter months.  The store provided cool drinks and cold water for us in the summer. The hardest part of the job was getting management to back their employees if a dispute arose between customer and employee."
good,"Clean environment"
good,"The hardest part of the job was waking up at 5 am to go to work. I did it but it was hard i had to get into the routine. I enjoyed this job for the reason that i felt i had some sort of freedom. I worked for the Pharmacy unloading the pallets and stocking them on the shelves. I was able to work at my own pace and take a break when i needed to. I have learned a lot with this company, as in FIFO ( first in first out) and how to ""zone"" my area making it presentable for the customers. One thing i really enjoyed about this job is that i was able to help the customers and interact with them. It felt good to be able to help someone and put a smile on there face."
good,"I worked in the garden center during second shift. I spent half my time at the register checking out customers and the other half stocking shelves, watering plants, etc. I learned much about various plants and lawn care. The management was always fair and my coworkers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the afternoon rush and the most enjoyable part was how hings changed every season so you never really got in a rut."
good,"Had the my gain of skill through this industry but had no support in doing so. Management is non-supportive and in need of training themselves. Store was always a mess be cause of that. When it came to asset protection need there was no one around. Great employees but low yearnings of wanting to be at work because there was no support given to them. Lastly, poor scheduling skills."
good,Fun merchandising and meeting new people.  Always busy and fast paced work environment. Days go by fast because there is always something going on.
good,Management were ok.  The hardest part of the job was to try to work while taking care of my sick mother.  Walmart refused to accept doctors excuse notes when I had to take off from work due to taking my mother to doctors appointments or hospital.
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar no wallmart, todos são muito profissionais não misturam problemas pessoais, educação acima de tudo, apesar de ter um salário ruim na epoca e a carga horaria muito puxado, fora isso muito bom. Aprendi muito nessa empresa, a agilidade e competência acima de tudo sem perder a gentileza e educação com os clientes, aprendi a gostar de trabalhar com pessoas, a lidar com cada tipo de personalidades deles. Consegui ganhar confianças de todos meus encarregados com honestidades e muita capacidade de exercer qualquer função que me pediam pra fazer."
good,"A typical day at work was stocking shelves, helping customers in need, and running a cash register. "
good,"My day consisted of clocking in at designated time, going to the bay area and changing oil, oil filters, air filters, doing flat repairs, rotating and balancing tires, and working as a cashier depending on the steadiness of business on a given day. We had an hour-long lunch but we had to take it when the supervisor gave us permission to."
good,"Bom tudo começou como operadora de caixa , ai mostrei minha motivação e fui para outro setor ""bazar"" la em abastecia e tambem fazia pedidos . a prendi tantas coisas como ver on hand negativo 5 semanas pedencias e etc. a parti mais dificil era q dava tudo de mim para melhorar o setor ter mais novidades para os clientes , a parte melhor era q com um imenso prazer tudo dava certo , me dava bastante com os colegas de trabalha era uma equipe super motivada , a gerencia nos motivava cada dia mais nao tenho o q reclamar!"
good,Walmart was a great company to learn the business of retail.  I enjoyed the people and fast pace of retail
good,Very very good job love it.. Real good people and great fun place to work very kind people n great team. Fast pace working made it fun n satisfying to see your hard work n results at the end of the day.. overnight hours where great a lot of work made the time go by fats I always say. Real good management.
good,This work place is a very busy department store an i ;ove helping customers with their needs an problems solving.
good,"Retail is retail, no matter where you work. Despite Wal-Mart's negative publicity, they have always been good to me as an associate. They worked with my schedule when I needed to take time for my family. They also allowed me to work my own schedule when I went to school full time and worked full time. I would recommend this company."
good,"my job is to provide customer sevice to all customers, I replace unwanted and returned items to the houseware Dept.Helping the customers to find merchandise or to exchange merchandise is a typical day for me. I like to respect my fellow co-workers and I get along with everybody."
good,"Constantly having to hire and train new people, including management, leads to a messy and disorganized team. Not anyone's fault but it seemed like management would take it out on everyone else. You were not allowed to refuse a shift or you got fired, so beware people who have kids or are going to school. But if you stick it out for the long haul you are almost guaranteed a promotion and you will get benefits despite your hours."
good,"It was a friendly work place with great co-workers, They help me with problems. It was a great experience to be a part of. I have work in a lot of part alot of different departments of the store from deli to cart pusher and had lots of fun."
good,"I worked 3rd shift, so there was never too much going on. Everyone stocks their department"
good,"Working with Wal-Mart was an overall positive experience. If I had the option to work with them again I would be happy too. Work was steady and it had its challenges. Learning the ropes was not all that tasking. Once you know what you are doing it is pretty straight forwards from there, but sometimes the job with throw you a few curve balls. The other employes were very friendly and I enjoyed working with them. Very impressive management."
good,I unloaded what was on my pallet onto the shelves and helped others who were still unloading afterwards
good,"-My typical day was to go outside and get carts."
good,"Overnight stocking at Wal Mart is very fast paced with a constant flow of merchandise coming in or out.  Its hard work, yet easy to accomplish when faced with a deadline. Ive learned to manage my time while meeting my goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses genuine gratitude towards my customer service skills."
good,"it was good everything. I did good job . so far it was Okay."
good,la empresa es muy efectiva tiene una estructura muy bien formada aqui aprendes dia con dia es una de las empresas de las cuales dia con dia se va renovando el ambiente laboral es bueno pero con lo unico inconforme que tiene la empresa es el suldo por los asociodos o empleados que estan en ella.
good,Typical work days involved us receiving orders from stores and going throughout the warehouse pulling merchandise.
good,"The work is challenging some times, but fun. Lots of merchandise to stock, and close deadlines to beat, management can be challenging to deal with."
good,Most days you knew what you were going in to. It was something different depending on days of the week but as a department manager you knew what you were doing and when. Loved dealing with the customers. Management changed quite often so that left little to be desired.
good,I like working at Walmart and I love the people I work with I just need a place to work that has stable hours. My hours always make it very stressful to care for a child on my own. I always have to worry about how I'm going to pick him or who is going to pick him up. I'm always very talkative with my customers and I get recognized for that by my managers because that's what they like to see. I always have a smile on my face which they recognize to. I've learned a lot of patience while working there and I've become more of a people person.
good,"I never really minded this job, the hours were ok. Breaks were guaranteed and helping customers was fun."
good,"A lot of work to be done with efficiency, I learned almost everything about store merchandising from them, good communication with management, everyone works like a team and when set to accomplish a goal we're all rewarded as a team if we meet it."
good,"I enjoyed assembling bikes, bbq`s and fitness items"
good,I worked their work just a short while to save up for an apartment in Pittsburgh but my experience their was fun. I was mainly in the back room with the rest of my team members so my only real interaction with customers was just directing then to department they are looking for. Working back their was fun unloading the massive truck with wise cracking co-workers made the nine hour heavy lifting shift go by really fast. he short time i was there i had no problems working for the company.
good,This was my very first job. Easy job to do. good co-workers. unloaded trucks and sorted the product on pallets. when the pallet was full we pulled it to the store floor using a pallet jack and but product out.
good,"Good for upper management, and lots of potential for advancement if willing to put in the work. Anything at store level aside from upper management is not worth it in my opinion, but a good place to start out at."
good,"The job was great for me it was close and it was something I enjoyed"
good,"Wal-Mart is a wonderful place to acquire skills with the possibility of advancement. A typical day consists of various and many sets of jobs. Primary focus is customer satisfaction and pushing sales. Working for Wal-mart I have acquired an enormous set of work related skills. Merchandising, being a leader, managing, customer service, keeping the workplace safe, teamwork, etc. I have an I can learn anything ideology, I continue to practice this. The hardest part of the job would be when individuals would not wish to cooperate and work as a team. In these situations I would do what was needed with a positive and friendly attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything I learned all the skills I acquired and continue to acquire."
good,Wal-Mart was a very good Employer. I really didn't have a whole lot of problems at this job. The only problem was to many managers over one department made it hard to follow directions from all of them.
good,even though I was a temp I was able to be very pro active an productive enjoyed the Wal-Mart working industry
good,"I never had any real issues with any of my co workers they were all very friendly and easy to talk too."
good,It was very hard to balance both my personal life and working overnight at Walmart. This job is more for people without families.
good,"Fast. We had to move the customers cars on time and with accuracy and satisfaction. "
good,A very typical day at work for me was very busy. I learned customer service and multi tasking skills. My direct manager was very understanding. My co-workers were great and very helpful at times. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every single customer. The most enjoyable part was working with great people.
good,"Your usual day consisted of a good amount of work, slack was not to be involved, you were held at a pretty considerable standard."
good,A typical day at work for me is greeting customers when entering in the store. looking at my daily activitys and maintaining the store and customer needs thoughout the day.
good,"A typical work day included helping customers in any way possible. Usually my day included ringing up customers' purchases, zoning and stocking products, cleaning the work area, and if needed working the return desk. Management for the most part was management; they were responsible for making sure we did as much as possible to make the customers' experience enjoyable. For the most part the co-workers were pleasant, there was a real sense of team work. The hardest part of my job was learning that the attitude customers projected on you didn't always have anything to do with you or the service you provided. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with different people on a daily basis."
good,My work day at Walmart would consist of me assisting the customers interacting with the customers. I would say most of my co workers were friendly and great to work with. By meeting and interacting with different people on a daily basis you learn a lot of stuff even about yourself. The most enjoyable part of this job were meeting and interacting with the customers. The hardest part was dealing with the rude customers but thank god for my patience and peoples skills.
good,"At first working at Walmart was a challegimg task, until I really took the time to figure out how to manage my time well as well help other people to have to store ready for the morning."

good,"I am very outgoing, helpful,on time friendly, Always good at what i do."
good,"Wal-Mart has a pleasant environment when it comes to customers and employee safety, however the relations between co-works and management can be quite strenuous. The goals and tasks I was given were obtainable and challenged me. The customer is always put first and are always right. Overall a good first job and learning experience but not a place (in my personal opinion) to settle down in."
good,The people you interact with on a day to day basis was phenomenal. Management wasn't all that great but it made up for it with the ability to talk to your co-workers and find out what problems they may had and how they fixed them.
good,"I gave Walmart 5 years. "
good,"Customer service, Very fast pace quality service, Cashiering, Mail out, Drive thru, Input, Filling, Third party solving, Telephone calls, Receiving stock, Crediting returns, and Maintained clean work space."
good,"I was with Walmart 7 years.  I worked on overnights, days and evenings. For retail, not a bad position.  Advancement opportunity is very possible if you work hard."
good,"This was a good work atmosphere, different people of different backgrounds and ethnicities and cultural differences that came together to make a business work. Some days were better than others, it tended to get really busy really quickly. That made for a good day. If it was slow it made a long day, but then one was able to go to different areas of the store and learn something new about the way it was run. Sometimes things did not ring up as they should have, whether it was new merchandise not yet in the system or newly clearanced, one would have to wait for a price check from a team leader. This gave one the opportunity to get to know the customer a little better."
good,"The manager is really great to work under, some of the lower managers not so much."
good,I loved working their. The managers were friendly and the co workers loved to help and show you what was going on. If you didnt know how to do something the showed you and walked you thru it to make sure you did it right and they didnt yell at you.
good,"En esta empresa hay un ambiente de trabajo agradebla prestaciones de ley, pero el sueldo es bajo"
good,"I managed day to day operations with the mindset of driving sales. I successfully merchandised multiple departments, and completed all tasks assigned within a specified time frame. I supervised other hourly associates and conducted interviews/evaluations. The busy seasonal times kept the job fast paced while maintaining a strong sense of adventure. Changes in policy promote a sense of adaptability and help combat static growth and complacency. There is a high opportunity for advancement and many chances to build strong leadership skills and display your personal talents and goals."
good,the managment has good day and bad but job security wasnt there i was promised 6 months but only got about 3 weeks
good,Empresa multinacional com bastante crescimento e precisando de evolução nas áreas de saúde e segurança do trabalhador

good,"Walmart is a ok company to work for. unless your full time don't expect to be able to live off the income you'll earn if you're in a department that's a class 2 or 1 (Just about any department that does not have a register and consumables like toys, cart pusher)."
good,"Entry level Food Service Personnel including Cook, Prep Cook, Pastry Assistant, Kitchen Assistant"
good,"Walmart just seemed to be a job that i went to to get a paycheck. It didn't satisfy my needs for customer service. I clocked in, did my job duties, then clocked out and went home. Minimum training was provided, most of it was learned as you go. Co-workers we friendly. It was easy to make friends and feel welcome at work."
good,"Typical day included constant stock of produce, going through all items checking dates and rearranging them according to dates. Co-workers were fantastic. I learned how to constantly keep busy, always had a job to do or a task to complete."

good,had a great team and they did not want me to leave we all put 150% into the job every day to get it done
good,Had a very unstable workplace where managers did not know what to do and started blaming employees that was not ranked as high as them.
good,"A typical day at work included me clocking in, opening a front register, counting cash in my drawer, and helping customers.  I learned how to accomodate every customer no matter if it were a complaint, bad experience, etc.  I also did some personal shopping at times for the elderly or handicapped.  The middle management teams at Walmart are motivating and great.  Always running around and helping employees.  Upper management is rarely seen in my opinion.  I don't really think there was a major hard part of the job, however, it was challenging during the retail holiday sales.  Extremely fast paced.  Kept me on my toes.  The best thing about the cashier position I had was that I met many many people and it didn't feel repetitious."
good,That's the thing. It's walmart. I live in the south. You see anything and everything walk throw that door. Sometimes the door. Pay was minimum wage. 7.40 I believe. They did work with you on hours if you had school and whatnot. But management was nice always could walk up and ask something or anything.

good,"The days were basic most of the time just seeing what needed to be done with the retail aspects such as stocking, and the customer satisfaction. I learned mostly about the department of lawn and gardening, and the job was overall not difficult."
good,Walamrt was a great learning experience overall.. a bit demanding for the pay but reliable once your in the door. the managment his sometimes harsh when they deal with certain situations involving team members.
good,It is a welcoming working environment to start and build a career in retail.
good,"Slow workers, timed work schedule, management that cant solve problems and are very rude."
good,Mcdonalds was a nice place to start off at as a first job but I didn't stay long because I was over worked and the managers were a little to unfriendly to me. I was not getting enough hours to pay my bills. They always sending people home because they scheduled to many people to work that day.
good,"A typical day at work to to me can be best describe as meeting a new person, and or learning about a person that I just met. A typical day at work to me is working with a team! Over all in work I've learned that when working it is best to take initiative, and work as a team player. My co-workers through out my work experience can be described overall as friendly, motivators, and successors."
good,My day usually was nice i got to meet alot of nice people being a sales associate i learned alot about my department my co workers were like family the hardest part of the job was dealing with management but besides bosses with attitudes the job is nice great bennefits

I currently have about 12 associates that work under me. I have worked at Walmart for a long time and my fellow associates have become family to me and it will be hard for me to leave but I'm ready to move on. I have learned how to be a good person and supervisor. The hardest part of my job are the crazy hours that can be expected of you. Working all holidays, some weekends, and overnights is stressful and unfulfilling. I really, truly love working in the Electronics department, I always have. Also I love the people I work with."

good,Walmart is fun place to work if you like fast paced work. The store is overall friendly and the customers appreciate your help. Once in a while there will be that one customer that doesn't like absolutely anything you have to say. The co-workers are fun to work with and management is easy to get along with. They are not too hard on you unless you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. The enjoyable part of the job for me was putting a smile on people's faces when they just wanted to get out of there and not deal with anyone anymore. It's nice to know that just a smile can actually affect other people.
good,"A typical day was helping customers make purchases or place things in layaway, take stock of inventory, add stock if necessary, cashier, help in other areas when people took breaks, worked with one other employee for part of the evening, then on my own until close, kept my area secure, and helped with loss prevention."
good,"A typical day included inventory control and warehouse work."
good,"With Walmart.com and Walmart ToGo, I felt very knowledgeable on the material as it was very easy to follow. It was one of my more stressful jobs (especially around holidays), but there always able to get through it. I also enjoyed the workflow from us reps to management, as management was very open to our opinions and was hands-on with resolving issues and concerns. However, was stationed in APAC, and there was always drama with APAC. Also, the pay was decent, but could have been better considering how much benefits were."

good,"My time at Wal-Mart was well spent. My personal work efficiency increased exponentially. The management team was mature and well-mannered. My co-workers became some of my greatest friends. I didn't struggle with much at the job besides the multi-tasking, which occasionally led to me forgetting things. The rewards however were many."
good,"Aprendí a trabajar bajo presión, a trabajar en equipo, mis compañeros me ayudaron a aprender rápido, realmente mi jefe no se involucró en el aprendizaje de los elementos de nuevo ingreso. Lo más difícil fue descargar mercancía ya que era demasiada y pesada. "
good,compañeros muy buenos dispuestos a ayudar...una empresa seria que me brindo lo necesario para trabajar comoda y a gusto.
good,A very exciting job. I love the fact that you constantly meet new and friendly people.
good,it was a job i enjoyed. unload trucks and pull freight to the floor.the manager was there if i needed help.i learned teamwork is important.my coworker became my friends and was there if i needed help.the hardest part was when we had to stop for problems in the trucks.
good,"Typical day at work involved me being harassed by my coworkers, while management allowed it to continue for 3 years, even after being reported several times a year. Management also made empty promises in regards to in-store transfers, promising positions to people only to have another manager make the final call. Too many managers with their own agendas made it hard for its associates to do their tasks because one manager always seems to contradict another."
good,Providing quick and friendly service is what I looked forward too.
good,typical day is ok. It gets crazy when you have irate customers but other than that its a nice place to work. You meet different people from all over and it helps you get a feel of the customer service world

good,"Walmart is a great place to work with the opportunity for advancement. If you show your worth it will defentially be noticed, which is the most enjoyable part of the job. Speaking for myself, the hardest part of the job was the hours I worked. (10pm-7am). It caused my life balanced to be off and interfered with my motherly duties. (which was the hardest part of the job) Overall Walmart has good management and is great company to work for!"
good,"mi trabajo era revisar entrada y salida de promotores cacheo y estar en piso de venta vigilando que no robaran nada, aprendi a ser mas cuidadoso con la gente, la parte dificil era estar con farderos en el MP, me gustaba lo que era piso de venta por que podias observar lo que habia a tu alrededor"
good,"Coming from Sams Club , working for Walmart is really an easy job to do when your a cashier. The co-workers i have are awesome, I've ran into some pretty cool people  Management is kind of lazy and you have some that really works hard, the hardest part is trying to stay cool cause its so hot in the building"
good,This should be the exact same as for when I put down for produce.  The only difference is that I did not have as much experience with customer service because I worked in the back more.
good,"Its a great place to work the people are wonderful, the hours are little rough on me with a two year old at home."
good,Managers must be able to multi-task. High energy. Must be able to learn and teach others at the same time.

good,"Working here is, so far, the funnest job I've had. Everyone is so nice and understanding. Walmart is so active in the community and it makes me proud to work for them. While my job may be a bit labor intensive working with all the people that I do makes it completely worth while. I've learned so much from all my supervisors and managers, they are easy to get along with and really understand that my schooling and scheduling are important to me and they accommodate my needs for that. I've only been here a few weeks but I already feel like part of a giant, extended family!"
good,"Had a lot of good memories from the people I worked with everyday (which was the best part of the job)"
good,"I would help customers find what they were looking for. I would ring them out, bag their groceries, and take care of their problems. You work 2 hours take a 15min break, work 2 more, take a half hour lunch, then work 4 more. It is very corporate and structured."
good,"I loved working there. I loved my job and the people I worked with. Even at the worst of days, we could make it fun. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers, and learning new ways to deal with them and make them go from frustrated to happy. The most enjoyable part was being an asset to the company and seeing people smile. Management needs a little work, at least at the store I was working for."
good,The job was good but having to work when you family was off was hard.
good,"Tinha uma boa comunicação com os funcionarios e clientes. Aprendi muito nessa empresa,pois ela me forneceu muitas oportunidades."
good,"I am a closing Deli member and I very much ENJOY my work! I love the busy bustle of the closing shift, there are always things t do. This was my first food oriented job and I learned many things about the ovens, fryers and slicers: Nighty cleaning and maintaining of all the equipment used daily and food safety and regulations. I am left without managers through 90%-100% of my shifts and must make many decisions and time management choices daily. As I said I very much do enjoy this job, but I would say the hardest part is the lack of team work at times and the lack of assistance of the Salaried Management of the store. That being said, I do love the sense of accomplishment! Looking at a finished, clean Deli and being very proud to stamp my name on it at the end of the day."
good,"ótimo supermercado boas chances de crescimento,funcionarios competentes.aprendi muito sobre essa áreas de alimentos,a parte mais dificil frio e a melhor o atendimento que traz bom aprendizado sobre como lidar com o publico."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to shop and from the outside is very beautiful, time consuming and saves many people money on day to day staple items.walmart is cost friendly and a very friendly place for customers, but as an associate it can be a very negative and dead end place to be employed. very little to no appreciation on behalf of managements part. Selective management are very appreciate and go above and beyond. working at walmart means surviving pay cheque to pay cheque until april when profit sharing is released. profit sharing also depends on the amount of shrink from that year (stolen and/or damaged merchandise). The hardest part of working at walmart is the constant and never ending amount of work that there is to do for very little pay ... if you are not on cash you are stocking shelves, or zoning ( returning merchandise to its home), it can get very tiring. the best part of working here is the relationship that you create along the way. a typical day as a casher is standing at the cash register for 8 hours with 2 fifteen minute breaks and an hours break. if you have no customers you zone"
good,"Clock in. Scan my badge to see where I begin my task. Make sure area is clean before I start. invite guest into my lane, greet customers with a smile. scan items, coupons, answer all questions to the best of my knowledge. If management wanted me to switch task I was always ready to muli-task. My co-workers were friendly and we all got along. the hardest part of the job was keep a 1000 scan per hour but I maintained it. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy. I learned a lot in sales, management duties, and lot of job task"
good,"I enjoy the culture and the job security.  My work life balance is the hardest. I am responsible for the entire perishable operation at night.  I was able to grow from within and my efforts recognized.  WalMart is a good fit for me because of my military background.  The policies and produres are clearly outlined, I love that.  I was able to transfer to the floor operation after 12 years in the quality assurance department."
good,Typical work day would be going right into helping customers management was very difficult to find and talk to at times. Co workers were always a great time.
good,"At the beginning of each day the workload seems impossible, especially when it's only you and several projects to complete. In order to finish you have to be your own motivation because at the end of your shift management expects the job to be done regardless. On the good days when the full team is present and the work goes so smoothly you have enough time to tackle extra projects it makes you go home feeling so accomplished that nothing can take your pride away."
good,The hours were good but the lacked in the breaks and time management.
good,"I learned a lot .. how to deal with customers face to face and handle cash,credit and debit transactions. I learned how to maintain good customer service skills and scanning and bagging item at a fast pace"

good,a typical day at work....I went to work did what I had to do and left.
good,"My typical day usually involves pulling stock form the back and making sure my department is neat, and organized.  It can be quite physical work, but I would rather be moving around that have to stand in one spot for hours.  My co-workers are really great and all pull their own weight, and I really like our group of managers, they come out and work the floor just as hard as the rest of us."
good,Clean work place. Everyone helps out in different areas so that we can all go home.
good,"I really love my job. I also love my co-workers and managers. Everyone gets along well and each department works together to make the company come together as one. A typical day at work for me consists of greeting, checking out, and ensuring customer satisfaction. I cannot say that there really is a hard part about working for this company other than sometimes customers try to give you a hard time; which is something I have learned as a customer, patience! I love my fellow employees most, we are like family!"
good,"its a good place to work employees and management are nice, you clock in run the register and put out merchandise along the registers if needed."
good,Very enjoyable job with a friendly environment and laid back management team.

good,"My experience with Walmart was a good one and bad one. I really enjoyed working for Walmart for the most part, I work in a few different stores in California and Washington State.My bad experience came when I transferred to a store in Chino California, the management was really bad from store manager to district manager. There was no cross training for other department, there was no support from managers, no communicating, no mentoring and leading just bad all around."
good,"I have learned how to multi-task, manage over 150 people, learn extensively about the HR business involved to serve our associates."
good,Fun and expanding place to work alot of diffrent people to deal with but as long as you put forth an postive attitude thats all dat matters.

good,The opportunities they offered and the job security. There hours they offered and the benefit packages where very beneficial.
good,"* Cashier duties"
good,"Help unload truck/trucks, take freight to  sales floor, there I would stock the area I was assigned to, At Wal-Mart I learned to work a number of useful tools, talzone, pallet jack, Our managment team was very helpful on giving us information on how to keep the store running its best.I would have to say inventory would have been the hardest part of the job, but that is where our awesome team work came in to play."
good,Good work environment. They want productivity. Good Company.
good,"Managed the day to day operations for a 900,000 sq ft building handling all food types."
good,"I enjoyed arriving at work everyday to a face-paced enviroment. I was able to learn the many aspects of great customer service while learning a great deal about automotives. Management allowed me to utilize my bilingual skills to assist the large spanish clientele of the community. The most difficult aspect of the job would be the pure physical force needed to stock auto batteries and pull tires. Overall, I enjoyed the time I spent at Walmart."
good,"With this company, snow or sleet- you will work. Compensation is good, however hours do vary and are all odd. Not family orientated at all."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, multinacional americana de lojas de departamento. Foi eleita a maior multinacional, seu  ponto forte sua cultura pilar de sustentação."
good,"The culture at a Walmart store is nothing I've ever seen before at store.  So many people with different backgrounds and roots that it is mind boggling how they can all work together.  Everyone goes to and fro with something to do, there is hardly any time to socialize that if you want to talk to somebody you'd better wait till your break in the break room.  Language doesn't seem to be an issue between co-workers who work in your same department as everyone knows their responsibility and what needs to be done.  The hardest part though was getting rid of the expired products, mostly because each item needs to be disposed of in very specific ways as the store has many different vendors and each with a diverse ways on how to handle their products.  However what makes it all gratifying is when the shelves are full and the customer can find what they are looking for."
good,A typical day at work was unloading the truck and placing them on the floor for 3rd shift stockers.  Going to lunch with the team while we talked about what we were going to do for the weekend if we got one. I learned how to distinguish what was going to be done on what night by the manager that was on duty.  I also learned that I am not as shy as I claimed to be for I was able to proficiently help a customer with no hesitation.  Management could have been a little better as I stated we were thrown in different directions according the manager that night.  As for my co-workers  I loved my team.  We were a family. I would have to say that the hardest thing about the job was leaving.  I enjoyed going into work and stacking the freight cause it was like playing tetris in 3D.
good,"Nice balance between work and home life, managers aren't that great, like to tell people how to do their job but do not do their own and make you feel stupid when you need to ask them something. Would of gave 0 stars to management if possible. People besides managers are nice people to work with, always an interesting day."
good,I really enjoy working at Wal-Mart.  I greet the customers when they bring their item to my register for purchase.  When appropriate I like to make small talk with the customer to make their time here enjoyable.  When you do your job at Wal-Mart you do not have any problem with Management.  Most of the co-workers I work with are great.  Actually I believe if you go in with a great attitude you will have an enjoyable day.
good,My position at Wal-Mart gave me an opportunity to acquire a variety of skills.  I was promoted several times and given the opportunity to learn many areas of the company.
good,"A typical day at work would be working at a very fast pace with a smile on your face almost every second of the day. Be ready to deal with any and every type of customer there is. What I've learned about working with Walmart is that everything seems better with a simple smile and that you should always look for an advance in the workplace. The management and co-works are a very diverse couple, although there was a little hint of corruption most of the management did very well taking care of it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customer who intentions were to be as difficult as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing mostly all my customer leave with a smile and a sense of satisfaction."
good,"The thing I just didnt like about wal-mart was, I was hired for part-time and given full-time hours of 40 hours a week and could not apply for benefits due to being hired part-time but working full-time"
good,"os processos são realizados a partir de metas cada funcionário tem sua meta, e a cada semana faz-se rodizio de função. com isso podemos procurar aprender tudo de cada função."
good,"very long hours, good pay, hard work, good stable company. this company have been around for a long time and it is not going anywhere. the work life balance is one sided."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to make sure that the sales floor was always in Grand opening shape. My job was rewarding at times, but the heavy lifting is alot to deal with every day. It really takes a toll on your body after years of working at this company. Management was extremely nice and helpful and my co-workers were hard working and team players. I loved taking pride in making my area of the store looking nice and ready for customers to shop."
good,"A typical day of work is auditing compliance aspects of the business, arranging repairs and training, and managing the performance of an office team through validation of processes. I have learned to manage effectively through a good example, education, and empathy. The most enjoyable part of the job remains the constant and varied interactions with individuals."
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart was interesting. You never knew who would be coming through your line. I met very many interesting people because Walmart is a big company. The hardest part of the job was standing in one spot for a long period of time, because I always have to be moving around."
good,Overall Wal Mart is a good company to work for. Pay as an hourly not very competitive but good pay as a salaried manager.
good,"Normal,organização,bom gerenciamento,boa comunicação,clima,intervalos"
good,"This is a well known company that I see being open for many, many more years to come.  I have some wonderful coworkers that I have the pleasure of working with.  I like my shift because I am only required to work Saturday thru Monday which gives me an opportunity to attend school or another job during the week."
good,"I learned how to interact with people with confidence, accuracey and speed. I expecially learned how to calm possible upset customers down and make them feel reassured what ever issues/concerns they had would be taken care of. The best part of my job was building relationships with my customers-it felt great to hear people say ""im waiting for this cashier because I enjoy her personality"" The hardest part of this job for me was overcoming my fear of the general public, and this job definately helped me with that! I absolutly enjoyed working there."
good,Working at Walmart was a fun and friendly work place i got to learn new ways of working and the coworkers were friendly and helped me out when i had trouble i never felt alone working there.

good,I worked with few people to help each other by unload all the boxes to put on the shelf at night at the store . and clean up the all boxes to put away in the bin back room in the store.
good,"Aprendí el trabajo de la reposición a la perfección, a mantener llenas y limpias las góndolas y desarrolle un buen trabajo en equipo tanto como con mi superiores como con mis compañeros.Lo que mas me gusto es haber conocido tanta gente en el espectro laboral y personal."
good,A typical work day is somewhat busy. I learned how to run a cash register at a fast pace. My co workers were very helpful and did great as working in teams.
good,Very demanding job.  Didn't know who to follow directions for at time.  Decreased work hours.  Very friendly

good,Management was always rriendlty and professional but the pay was not what I would expect for job performance
good,The job was overall fun great people an good hours. Wish management was better.
good,"Walmart associates have many diverse tasks to do on a daily basis. At any moment, anyone from any department can find themselves helping a customer in a different department. Most Walmart associates learn a variety of tasks. The management is well organized. They too have to know lots about most departments in the facility. I'd say the most difficult thing about working at Walmart is coping with the holidays. Black Friday and Thanksgiving were tough and there were many tasks for each employee to fulfill. My most enjoyable part of working Walmart is the opportunities to meet wonderful people in a wonderful environment."
good,"Meus picos de motivação era quando tínhamos o desafio de atender fiscalizações e juntos conseguimos atender as pesquisas no tempo dado, onde normalmente era curtíssimo. Aprendi com muitas pessoas, tive muitos amigos, que me ajudaram e me ensinaram muito, principalmente no inicio da minha carreira como líder. Tive ótimos colegas de trabalho, onde alguns levo até hoje como amigos pessoais."
good,"I really like working for Walmart as most of the Managers are very good. It's a family oriented company and understand that we are human, not robot. I really recommend people to join Wal-mart if you like challenges. Everything is huge at Walmart as being $470 billion company."

good,"At Wal-mart I worked in the jewelry department. I loved being in this department because it was located in the front of the store,and there was always people to help. In the course of one day I would zone and scan the department, stock jewelry, change batteries, make pa announcements, and sell lots of jewelry. I like the customers because they were unpredictable, and I liked the people I worked with."
good,I have been in different departments at Walmart. I'm a member of Social committee and Safety team.We do fun things to raise money for the community. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer service. Helping customers with their needs.
good,"We come in at 10 P.M. and we have a meeting before we start work. We check our tasks and we get our carts, buggies, pallet jacks, and trash bags. We start separating our freight out and stock it. Every time we take a break we must take overstock to the back for other workers to bin it in. When we get done we zone and clean up and go home."
good,It is an very fun and challenging job it is fast paced and easy to pick up.I learned an whole lot on my job the mangement team is very nice and they will work with you to assure that you learn your job every possible way.my co workers is supportive they stood by me when i was still learning and they was really friendly.the hardest part of my day was really nothing the job was easy to an extent and the most enjoyable part of day was whenever a customer asked me for help.
good,"I had to count all of the cashier's registers and check for any errors ,counted substantial amounts of money."
good,"i learned where and how to be productive, task management, learned the true nature of multitask,"
good,Long hours if you are management. It pays to be placed in a good store. If not your are in for a long grueling work day.

good,While working at Walmart I learned their receiving and shipping system also their inventory system.

It had its moments but overall the people I waited on worked with every day was very rewarding!"

good,"Walmart was a fun place to work, I enjoyed meeting new people and helping in any way I could.  It was only part time but I enjoyed every minute of the time I was there.  I enjoyed and learned a lot about jewerly and how to repair and fix watches and other jewelry.  The co-workers were also enjoyable to work with..  the hardest part was leaving, which I did not have much choice since I was offered a job with the State Department of Workforce Center and the traveling overnight interferred with this."
good,It was a great place and company to work for. I wish I were still there and im sorry i lost my job. Im currently trying to get back on my feet and want the opportunity to prove myself. It was a fast paced job and it pushed your pretty hard every night. I learned so much and met alot of great people and want to go back to the same job. The management was outstanding and they seemed to genuinely care. My co workers were all great and i miss them all especially my Wal Mart former employees.
good,Every job has its ups and downs but when you work at Wal-Mart they draw you in and make you apart of the team.
good,Bilingual Customer Service with money center training and cashier exp.
good,"I was part of the Inventory control team at Walmart.  Which is on the receiving team.  Our work day consisted of unloading the truck and putting merchandise on the sales floor.  It was fast paced, as we only had 7 hours to get the work finished.  Management was not above helping out when and wherever needed with merchandising.  The hardest part was probably getting up and down the ladder with merchandise in our hands.  The most enjoyable part was the fact that there were no customers in the store so we were able to work quickly and efficiently at getting the merchandise out on the sales floor and the store was presentable at opening"
good,"i started the day by cleaning and working hard. that was my first job so i learned a lot of life lessons. the management were like guides and very appreciated. the co workers were like family wise mature and excellent with the customers. the hardest part about that job was     "
good,Good company to grow career. Work requires focus and hard work to succeed and run the company smoothly.
good,"I worked overnight 10pm-7am. I was a stocker, my night consisted of logging onto a kiosk to get my task for the night. Report to the area I was assigned, did what i needed to do. You get two 15 minute breaks and a hour lunch. Management was pretty cool, demands were a little much but were easy to task if time allowed it."
good,"I enjoy what I do "
good,A typical day of work is running non stop until you go home. I learned how to deal with customers at this job. management was ok and easy to approach. Co- workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was in the summer and it got really hot outside. Most enjoyable part was being outside a lot.
good,Leadership actively supports your career goals and helps merge company and individual growth providing opportunities for mutual success.
good,I would run the cash register.  Loved my co-workers and the customer contact.  Meeting new people daily was very enjoyable.  Management was great and friendly.  The hardest part of the job had to be prolonged standing in one place.

good,Walmart is a good company they have flexible scheduling options but  mostly only part time temporary positions.
good,Me pareció una empresa organizada en lo que es el rubro del trabajo donde pude desempeña bien mis aptitudes en el puesto que me toco cubrir.
good,"The money you make is decent, however if you want to work all early shifts you better just find someplace else. I'm a full time student and working here at the same time and it is very stressful."
good,great place to work but is very demanding. and not payed enough for all that is required.
good,Uma empresa valoriza seus clientes e da oportunidade para crescimento profissional..
good,I would probably still be there but I had some personal and transportation issues. I love the benefits. The security of the job was shallow. Management (some not all) would actually do there job. But overall I liked the job.
good,"If you like to help others, this a great place, if your looking to care for your family not so much. the low pay and management are not worth it. Inadequate training."
good,"Each day after I have clocked in, I would grab a basket and walk around the store keeping my eyes open for shoplifters. I would also walk into the backroom and check on the locks on all bay doors to make sure they are locked and check our compactor. I also went through a checklist everyday as I walked around the store."
good,This job taught me about patience and passion. The most passionate part of the job is interacting with people and that was something I enjoyed doing.
good,empresa que da oportunidade de trabalho  e da oportunidade que crescimento profissional .
good,"It is an ok place to work. There is a lot of drama due to so many people who work there. I really enjoyed working there it is a very fast paced job. I really enjoyed helping the customers find what they needed and showing them new items that came in. Management needs some work, there was a lot of favoritism between management and employees."
good,management and associates were awesome to work with. had lots of fun staying busy.
good,"poco trato con mis superiores."

good,No two days are alike.  Always have something to do.  Always good people around to work with.
good,"My supervisors were very informative and helpful while showing me how to do things I did not have any previous experience in. My co-workers were also helpful in getting me used to how things worked there as well as showing me little tips on how to make certain tasks easier to do. I learned a lot there in the short time I was there. I learned how to operate a cash register and also got more comfortable with talking to people I don't know. This job really helped me to open up and I found that I am not quite as shy as I used to be. Everyone I encountered there was very helpful and understanding while still telling me, in their own way, that I need to basically suck up my nervousness and just do what needs to be done."
good,"great retail company to work for, great opportunities for advancement"
good,"I worked for walmart seven years. i worked many area's including cashier, electronics, cartpusher, dairy\frozen stocker , produce, dry grocery, and even deli. I enjoyed what i did and the people i worked with. I decided after seven years in retail it was time for a change"
good,I worked in electronics and I enjoyed selling the products to customers and the rush around Christmas because it keeps on going. I learned plenty about not letting what people say about you get to me because it comes with the territory. Customers and sometimes your co-workers can really strike a nerve and you have to know how to let it go and move on. Management is just like they want to see you work from the time you clock on to the time you clock out. Never look idle or you will work.
good,"Typical week 60 plus hours your average day includes customer service, problem solving, teaching and training."
good,"most of the shift is customer service and floor organizing, very good management team at the time."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-mart, although I did not see eye to eye with  my shift supervisor. But overall, a valuable experience."
good,"I worked in several different septs while i was in the store so my day differed as my career with WalMart went on.  I started out as a cashier and learned various customer service. I then was moved to the Photo Lab where my typical day consisted of developing film, sales of cameras, changing  chemicals for machines, cashier, and customer service to any customer who had a question.  "
good,"Uma otima empresa na qual aprendi muito e mim sai muito bem,foi uma troca muito grande meu desempenho mim trosse muito conhecimento."
good,Loved seeing the world and enjoy the life that the navy offered.
good,I typically stock the freight that comes in while rotating the product. Our management was decent. You have the really good ones that are dedicated to their job and help you out as much possible.
good,"A typical day at Walmart requires that you clock in and prepare yourself to do everyone else's job but your own. However, at the end of the day when your job is not complete or something goes wrong in the area you are responsible for, even though you were not there you are still liable for everything."
good,Its a good buisness to work for when the right manager is in place. The Pharmacy location in Cockeysville is currently not being run by a good manager. Most of the patients are good and fun people.
good,"Exciting! The culture is second to none. You consistently busy all day, assisting customers and associates. Trying to be everywhere at all times. The smile after you resolve a problem."

good,"Working at Walmart was always interesting, I met a lot of great people and really enjoyed working there. I learned a lot about different types of sales tactics and how to handle difficult customers. The hardest part of the job was working with the difficult customers and how to satisfy them. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers that I made friends with, almost everyone was easy to get along with and there was always someone you could talk to if you were having a bad day."
good,"very larger company, tons of work to be completed, flexible schedules, HR very professional and ensure that every team member is up to date on the learning modules"
good,"The job was fairly easy.The managers were nice,as were the co-workers."
good,"I worked stocking shoes, assisting customers. The hardest part was being on my feet all day, but the most rewarding part was helping the customers."
good,"Na área comercial, o desafio é o que conta. Liberdade para trabalhar mas ao mesmo tempo há cobrança por resultado. Tudo que sei sobre varejo aprendi no Walmart. Excelência no trabalho, convivência com vários grupos de pessoas, negociação comercial nacional e internacional; Direção e Gerencia são diversificadas pois, algumas vezes, pessoas de outros países vêem gerenciar formatos; Colegas de trabalho: Muitos vêem de outras grandes redes. A empresa valoriza quem se formou na empresa, enfim, há diversidade de pessoas e grupos; A parte mais difícil do trabalho é manter resultado consistente de venda, margem e lucro todos os meses do ano por vários anos; A parte mais agradável do trabalho é a responsabilidade e senso de dono que cada funcionário deve ter para a realização do trabalho."
good,"a empresa era muito boa de se trabalhar reconhecia os seus associados ,os benefícios eram ótimos ,o salario também estava bom ,mas a gerencia que estava no período estava deixando a desejar como encarregada não tinha muito suporte da gerencia da unidade e ficava muito difícil de se trabalhar e os horário que eu fazia estava esgotante uma semana de manha 6:30 as 16:00 e a semana seguinte a tarde 14:00 ate o ultimo cliente e associado sair isso era meio estressante,eu fazia duas a três semanas por mês. "
good,"This job was a good job, unloading trucks and delivering pallets to sales floor, along with binning overstock and picking the already stored items to take restock the sales floor."
good,I did everything from checking out customers to unloading trucks to operating a forklift. There are plenty of different jobs to do and the pay at the time wasnt bad. Great place for college students to work. scheduling is pretty flexible too
good,"A typical work day is opening the pharmacy and deleting old medicine that was not picked up and file new medicine that needs to be picked up for the day."
good,"Working at Wal-mart was a great learning experience. My coworkers were very friendly. The managers were very willing to work with me and any problems and questions I had. "
good,"Overall fun job. Get licensed to drive stand-up/sit-down forklifts, perform some manual labor; unloading trucks, move freight, carry up to 50 lbs., never standing still. "
good,"Um dia típico da empresa e a comemoração dos estrelas e aniversariantes do meses,as atividades destinada a minha profissão na empresa,os meus gerentes são ótimos líderes ,ótima equipe,o mais difícil é trabalhar no final de semana e os descontos sem explicações , as amizades os conhecimentos  e o salário no final do mês."
good,Learned that everyday can be very different especially closer to the holidays.
good,helping customers making sure all cashiers have chage and over see the breaks co-workers were great just didnt get enough hours
good,The store is broken but gives opportunity to advancement. Management lacks communication and collectiveness. Many of the associates are unhappy and unfortunately have little desire to change. There are a handful of long term associates there that provide a great knowledge base of the areas they supervise and of the local community.
good,Started working here during college and really liked the flexible hours and schedule for students.
good,"-The day is routine: Clock in, Unload trucks, Pull merchandise out to the floor, and taking other product off the backroom shelves and bring them out to their designated aisles."
good,Work at Wal-Mart was pretty easy and time went by very fast. Co-workers were easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was the constant lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I had a job I enjoyed. It was a job where I did my own little thing. I worked in the produce section so it was usually just me. I had to go about and figure things out on my own a lot of times; which was fine with me because I like being independent.
good,I lead and manage a group of associate with the store to keep the business running. at the same to to make a customer happy
good,I learned a few things about retail and customer service while working here.
good,i would stand at a cash register all day and ring up peoples items and take their money.
good,I love to work at wal-mart. A typical day at work would be signing in to the cash register.
good,"Like any other company Walmart has its share of bad employees and managers but overall is not too bad. It is easy to do your job, meet expectations, and receive a pay increase every year. They take their ""open door"" policy seriously and you can appeal management decisions to a higher authority without fear of retribution."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading merchandise trucks and maintaining the furniture department. I learned that management does not want to help people advance in the company, but they want to fire them or keep them at a certain level in fear of their own jobs. My co-workers were great and some of them became my second family. The hardest part of the job was satisfying the customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was doing my work to the best of my ability."
good,Working night shifts from 10pm-7am can be fun and at times hard but very beneficial
good,"always good to have set work hours.  I learned how to manage a crew of ten. Love to contribute to team that was determain to win and play as team players. I can work with anyone that has the ambition to get the job done. Hardest part of my job would have to be having the final word of a person keeping or loosing their job.  meeting people and learning about people, learning new things."

good,I enjoyed my time there. It worked for me. Management was good.
good,"It is demanding, have learned much, have experienced much, and have foregone much to achieve.  The ceiling for Walmart is the one that you place yourself."
good,Its a ok place to work hours my get cut. ok place to work other than getting your hours cut.
good,Management listens to concerns and tries to solve employee issues in a timely manner. The hardest part of job is scheduling and only hires part time.
good,"I had a great experience working at Inktel. Management was awesome, filling  almost every need of their employees."
good,"I enjoyed exchanging different food ideas,and giving samples out for testing.Working with food is a excellent way to interact with people, and learn about different cultures.The staff was very helpful and mangement works well with letting you pretty much use your own judgement in handling difficult circumstances.The hardest part for me is explaning to a customer that theyre order is not there due to a miss understanding on the store part, and trying to get it done in a timely order without making them upset.The most enjoyable part for the job is getting great compliments from satisfied customers."
good,"learned to drive forklift"
good,The people made the job much better place to be and to work really the ones that was always there
good,My experience with walmart has had its ups and downs. But overall I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Time go by rapidly because you are always busy.  The co-workers were very welcoming.  Managment was very friendly.  The hours were hard, because I could not be home with my family as much."
good,Typical day of work is helping customers finalize sales counting money drawers I have learned more about customer service with little management duties had a lot of fun getting to know my co workers and I always enjoy working with people the job was fun and easy
good,some of the employees were rude and disrepectful and some were very kind and helpful.
good,The most enjoyable part of my time at Wal-Mart was the people I met along the way. All of my customers became almost like family to me and I would always love to meet new people on a daily bases. The hardest part about the job was when I was unable to assist someone and help them with whatever they needed because it was out of my control. The Hardest part about the job was making a decision to go back to school and knowing that the company would not be able to work with my schedule.
good,I love helping people and making sure they receive excellent customer service.
good,"WalMart in general is pretty much about who you know. You can work hard and get your work done, but it's never enough. You're always expected to get 10 times the work done in half the time. Some managers are pretty good, and some are just ridiculous."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart can be either very busy or very slow but there is constant work needing to be accomplished regardless. I learned much about food safety and other safety regulations. Management was competent but often there was a lack of managers available during the day. Co-workers varied as they do with any job. The hardest part of the job was multitasking and trying to make sure the customers were taken care of in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was the compliments I received from management when customers reported my excellent service.
good,The management at Walmart didn't always play by the rules. They would have their favorite people that would be the only people to get recognized. They didn't appreciate all the hard work I did.
good,"Cashier, lay-away rep., credit card rep, and stocked shelves. Set up displays, answered telephone, door greeter. I learned to run a cash register, submit applications for credit card approval, and how to process lay-a-ways. Management was easy to approach and co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job is that you are on your feet the whole time that you work (except for your breaks and lunch). The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers."
good,"A normal day working as a night stocker at Wal-Mart consist of clocking in and meeting with the managers so we can be assigned a task for the night. My co-workers were amazing because we would all help each other out if one of us finished our task before the others. The hardest part about this job was learning where everything was and common techniques to speed up the process of stocking everything faster, since speed was key. The most enjoyable parts of this job was when we all showed incredible team work and were able to finish way before our scheduled time. Seeing people other people willing to help others, even if they didn't need to, was always refreshing and helped me coped with having to work all night even.

The management team were not supportive of workers. Co-workers most were friendly and helpful. The hardest thing being employed with Wal-Mart for doing the overnight cashier job was having to lift heavy stock boxes. Most enjoyable part when I was allowed to organize the clearance rack.
good,"good working experience"
good,"The schdualing for hours worked was all over the place open one day close the next, but co-workers were excellent."

I learned product numbers that helped maneuver through transactions faster and worked with management to control busy periods. I did not have much interaction with co-workers but we helped one another reduce traffic when necessary. The hardest part of the job was to stand in one spot for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the knowledge I gained by encountering various merchandise from foods to appliances."
good,Good job for a college student.  New people working everyday less you see the people that work there awhile.
good,Co-worker were great management showed to much favoritism to certain people.All people should have same oppurtunity at all positions.Not enough cashier to take care of customers.I have management experience and understand bottom line but customers should always come first.
good,The work wasn't to overbearing and the hours where good. I learned how to manage my time at work and take consideration  of my fellow co workers. The hardest part of the job was when no one communicated properly and we fell behind schedule.

good,"In the nine years I have worked as an overnight stocker, I have learned different areas of customer service as well as the importance of learning all one can learn about the company and the different positions available within the company. Management has shown great appreciation for employees who show initiative and willingness to move from one task to another. In the retail industry, co-workers are not just others who work for the company. Co-workers are team members who must work together to stock merchandise and meet customer demands. The hardest part for an overnight stocker is working to get merchandise stock during high volume times. Customer service is the most enjoyable part of being an overnight stocker because there are so many different customers and very interesting situations that customers bring into a store."
good,"Walmart is a very busy place. Each department works as a great team. We support each other. I enjoy helping people locate items and decide which product would work best for their situation.

I had to learn how to use a cash register, price scanner, and how to clock in and out. my co-workers were very nice and understanding. the hardest part of working here was that the management were not as nice seeing as they worked really hard. i enjoyed working with the customers and my co-workers."
good,I love working with customer's and making their shopping experience easier
good,"Wal-Mart is the kind of company you can progress with. The compensation is fair but benefits are expensive. The management staff are good people, but corporate cutbacks have hurt the lower levels of management the worst. Turn over is extremely high and production standards have been raised while cutting staff at the same time."
good,Liked working at Walmart. Very clean atmosphere. The workers were friendly and would help each other any way they can. Management were ok just had their certain picks.

good,Fun place to work. Very competitive wages and ability to advance.
good,Open the area you are in.  Set up registers and prep books for the day.  Co-workers are just as eager to get daily work done.  Like the fast pace work.  Hardest part of job sometimes is keeping up with customer traffic.

good,"llegar y saludar a los compañeros y poner en orden mi carpeta para empezar a trabajar "
good,"I work in the electronic Department but trying to expand to other departments. Because I'm a single dad caring for 2 children, my hours are kind of limited to day time only. Its hard to get many shifts at Walmart with only limited availability. The co-workers are usually great and easy to get along with. I was recently on the Renovation team for 4 months and learned many thing throughout the store. This part of the job was the most enjoyable as I like setting things up or changing equipment."

From unloading a truck to (Acting) Assistant Manager in charge for the day. Learning to work along side the different styles of Managers the company provided. Loyal, hardworking and eager associates. Hardest part of the job was taking vacations and unable to complete a task or project to start another one. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to find what a customer needs whether it be at another location or with another company."
good,"I love my current position as a Photo Lab Associate, I thoroughly enjoy helping customers print their pictures and gaining relationships with each person."
good,"Stocking, merchandising, customer interaction. During my time of working at walmart I gained more knowlegde on how to operate cash registers and interact with customers.

Y la parte mas dificil fue un poco el traslado a mi hogar. Por el horario y lo que mas me gusto fue que logre dominar los conocimientos respecto al area de cajas, donde tuve personal a mi cargo."
good,"I helped to finish building the store and then once it opened ran cash registers.  It was a great experience to see what went into actually getting the store ready to be opened and the work was always a fun challenge.  Once the store opened it was a fun experience to be running cash register, mostly because of the number of people that I got to interact with on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day at walmart would be going in, and unloading a merchandise truck with minimal problems.  I learned how to make huge pallets of merchandise to be distributed through out the store for assosiates to stalk shelves with.  I also learned how to scan merchandise into the store system, and how to deal with customers and there questions.  Most of my co-workers were more then friendly and good guys to work with.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unexpected truck loads of merchandise, and finding some where to put it all.  And the most enjoyable part of working there was the 10% discount you get from working for them."

good,Over the 10 years I worked there I overall ejoyed it. I felt I learned alot of things good and bad. Over all management was good although my last manager there  many issues that made me feel unwanted and unappreciated.
good,En esta empres es una de las cuales te brinda el poder trabajar despues de habres salido de la escuela es una empresa que no  paga bien pero que ayuda a tenes experiencia labora que en otras  instituciones no te brindan
good,"This company is great to work for, even if Sam Walton's values are somewhat lost."

good,Basically the same work everyday. Fast Paced. Good pay. Hard Work makes the day go by a lot faster.
good,"I would come in and go straight to my register I was assigned. I learned how to be a better team player. Our management was ok. I try not to find the negative in someone, so I can find a good trait in each of them. The hardest part of my job working self-checkout. The most enjoyable part of my job there was making my customers happy."

good,"Working here was ok. I made good money, I just didn't like what I did."
good,"A typical day at work is customer service."
good,The job is easy. Your managers give you a list to do through out the day and all you have to do is complete it by the end of your shift. Management and staff are fair with you and if you don't think you can complete all your tasks they will understand if you ask someone for help without judging you. I wouldn't say for certain that the job is/isn't enjoyable. It is a typical everyday job so it has it's ups as well as it's down parts to it. Overall it was a good job.
good,walmart employees have became like a family to me making for a better working environment
good,"Supervisors took the time to train you in the workings of the company."
good,"it was a fun family oriented place to work early on in the 90s, however the company got so big, that the family values went right out the window. Contrary to popular belief, when I worked there the benefits were good and the pay was very competitive . no one was paid minimum wage and the potential to earn more or advance was very high. I left there earning about 38000 after 17 years of service. but they will not hesitate to let you go if it will save face in a situation weather you were at fault or not even if you have a spotless record."
good,A typical night at work is cleaning the produce department thoroughly making sure there is no debris and dirt on any of the product and what the product is sitting on. I learned that management is the best to deal with when they are in a bad mood. But as long as you do your part to make the process smooth you should be in there good graces. I love the people I work with because we can relate to each other and most of us know each other personally. The hardest part is breaking down the big trucks of product we get in every night because it can be 10+ pallets every night.

good,"A typical day at work was going in, getting freight from the back and running it to the sales floor. Made sure merchandise was stocked and in place so when customers came to shop, it was easy to find. Learned how to keep organized and work in a timely and efficient manner. Management was okay for the most part. There were some who got on you just simply because they did not like you, or the fact that you could converse and STILL get ALL of your work done so they needed to pick on you. Co-workers were great. Had a blast with them even outside of work. Hardest part of the job was unloading some of the trucks. Most enjoyable part was being in the backroom with the unloaders."

It is very that everybody is on the same side of the road by acknowledging that the customer is the reason why we exist."
good,"A typical workday is all you are likely to get at Wal-Mart. I have an easier time telling you about an atypical day, since more of those stand out. Most days, I would show up, go to the meeting, stock for about the next 6 hours, clean-up and go home. Interaction between me, co-workers and management was minimal, unless there was a major concern. The hardest part of the job was definitely having to clean up other people's mistakes."
good,"I am very focused on my work, and consequently, am able to work quickly.Because I am very organized, I am able to accomplish a lot in a limited amount of time.I'm always on top of my projects, but I do welcome input and will consult with team members to ensure we're all on the same track."
good,"-Responsible for conforming identification of gym members and guest"

I've learned a lot being at Walmart, such as, handling customers, phone calls, and refunds. I love how my co-workers are there to help me out if i need help. I can say the hardest part of my job is dealing with a frustrated customer. I like helping a customer leave happy for instead if she/he didn't like a way another associate rang them up or talked to them, I would go out of my way to make sure I could help."
good,Its fun but also hard and the pay for the job is not that great they could pay more than they do but they choose not too and I feel they should have better Managers but overall its a good company to work for
good,I never lacked for something to do and my duties had sufficient time filling tasks to provide a full days work.
good,a typical day at all my jobs was learning everything I could about that job to see what I could do to improve on my skills. what I learned is that everything isn't what it is. my co-workers showed me everything about the job. hardest thing about my job is finishing before everyone an most enjoyable part was meeting new people and learning new things.
good,"Working for Wal-Mart in Greenville, MS is a good company to work for. Although, it does have it's flaws just like any other company does it has more goods than its bad. The managers are just like any other manager at any other jobs, some are great and some are not so great. One thing I will say about the managers, they will work with what you have. If you have an emergency and need to leave, they will let you leave. If you are having trouble with your hours, the HR will solve that problem."
good,I learned that working hard as a team gets things done. I enjoyed going to work and working with my coworkers.
good,I would go into work set up my cart and demo the product. Afterwards I would take down my cart and clean up then go home and do my paperwork based on the demo. I learned top manage my time and resources to accomplish the tasks given to me in the time frame I have. My management was hard driving and continually pushed me to strive to be my very best. My co-workers understood me and my needs and allowed me to understand theirs making teamwork between us very effective. The hardest part of the job was the constant movement all over the place. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating an enjoyable experience with the products demoed.
good,"How to now and work whit peoples."
good,"Grab a gemini and sign in to start inventory at exactly 7am."
good,Walmart was a average place to work.  The pay for the work expected is reasonable.  Walmart no longer satisfies my desire to utilize my degree and advance in my career.
good,"A typical day at work involves processing returns, handling customers, answering and directing calls from multiple phone lines, cleaning the department, and helping management make sure that all tasks in the apparel department are taken care of."
good,"Work life balance weak,"
good,"Working at wal mart I feel I have gained valuable knowledge in the retail field. I believe that this is a company that encourages advancement and promotion. I feel management is concerned about employees, and we are treated with respect. I have nothing negative to say about my wal mart experience."
good,Its a great p;ace to work the management team know what they want done. Most of the co-workers are nice. I learned how to work with a large group of people. Overall I would say its a great place to work.

good,"A typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart included socializing with customers as you assisted in the check-out of their purchase, maintaining a positive attitude, and cooperating with customer service managers(CSM's) with additional tasks if requested.  During my time here, I learned how to operate a register and deal with unfriendly customers in a positive way.  Management was generally friendly in all aspects of the job, from reviews to cashier meetings.  Co-workers worked well with each other, and socialization was allowed as long as they stayed busy with individual tasks.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset or rude customers in a positive way.  The most enjoyable part of the job was socializing with co-workers and friendly customers."
good,My typical day at work was stocking the floor and the backroom. It was a fun but tough job due to managers being short staffed in some areas and being pulled to help another department sometimes.
good,"co workers were nice "
good,"Worked 10 hour days, 4 days per week.  Started in the morning at the input station, then moved to filling after new prescriptions and troubleshoot were completed.  Rotated between filling, input and troubleshooting throughout the day.  Had 6 other technicians, 3 cashiers and 3 full-time pharmacists."
good,"In a typical day, I would work 6-8 hours on a cashier, or in the clothing dept, helping give breaks or assisting in other depts in slow times. Wal-Mart taught me how to provide customer service to all walks of life and how to work with people I liked and didn't like."
good,"I love working with people, and working with the public.  I love communicating with and helping people.  The customer service managers are patient and willing to help, and my co-workers are friendly, team players.  The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule.  The most enjoyable part is interacting with the public."
good,Be prepared to work and advance in Walmart. Great career choice for management potential.
good,"Verificar que mail llegaron y ejecutarlos,darle una vuelta ala bobega y piso de vendas,ver con cuanto versonal contaba para organizarnos para llenar piso y acomodo de bodega ,con la gerencia me hacia saber sus prioridades y retoalimentacion,con Marina organizarnos que hiba ser cada uno regularmente me tocaba lo aministratibo con los compañeros muy participativos y buena comvivencia."
good,"Enjoyed working at my previous job, I liked most of my co/workers, and they liked working with me, a lot of them relied on me, when I was transfered to jewelry the customer service managers were upset, so they would call me up there to help them out. The hardest thing is that I worked all the time and had no personal time. I had surgery this year on my foot, when my LOA was up they would not follow what my doctor wanted so I had to resign. The insurance they carried was really bad and expensive. Could not get a weeks vacation till you were there for 2 years."
good,"typical day was stocking shelves and zoning merchandise"
good,"En mi puesto como vigilante aprendí demasiado en cuanto a la organización y procedimientos de la tienda, me enseñaron a inventariar mercancia, revisar videos de seguridad, detectar personas que entrar a robar a l tienda y la manera de abordarlas."

good,"Nothing but customer service, no matter your job."
good,"I was required to stock shelves, interact with customers, make sure that the department was clean and welcoming to customer. I have learned how to interact with other kinds of associates and how to treat them even when they are not doing their job up to par.I have learned how to be patient with others and how to speak to rude customers without making the situation worse. Managment was difficult to work with sometimes they were power hungry and treated us like we were slaves, some of the managers expected favors from the girls in the department. In the end most co workers were enjoyable and really helped out."
good,"A typical night would include me checking out customers, greeting customers at the door, and stocking shelves. I learned to complete a task in a timely manner the first time asked.

A typical day consist of customer service dealing with a diverse environment and time management.

The hardest part which I would call challenging will be the customers and that is dealing with all types. The most enjoyable part of the day for me was that leaving the job with everything completed and making someone from an associate to an customer day."
good,"bom ambiente de trabalho, bom relacionamento com colegas, aprendi muito como trabalhar no comércio, chefia muito bem qualificada."
good,typical workday is complicated. I've leaned a lot working for the company. My management isn't that good on handling certain things. I love my coworkers. They keep me going through the night. The hardest par of the job is working on the night shift being timed on everything we do. What I enjoy mostly about my job is being able to meet the people I know now.
good,What more can be said? It's a great place to work as long as you don't have to support yourself.
good,"help customers all day and make sure everything is neat"
good,"I liked most things about Wal*Mart while I worked there.  My Store Manager was fair and sharp. I had resources I could rely upon to back me on my projects.  The people within my supervisory realm were good workers and we communicated well. We had the best departments in the whole district.  Our sales, profit margin and customer satisfaction was consistently above all other stores. The hardest part was low pay.  I had great raises but the starting pay was so low it took a long time to reach a livable pay rate.  I enjoyed the customer support of each of my departments, I always had the store manager telling me he had heard good remarks from them.  The feeling of accomplishment was a great incentive."
good,"Routine daily work "
good,"Working at Walmart I help customers constantly, answering questions, giving them information about many products and operating a register. I also stock merchandise, set up merchandise on how they are placed on the shelves and perform audits and logs on cell phone and apple products. I help with photo lab as well in helping customers operate the kiosks and organize photos in envelopes for customers."
good,You are given something to do the entire time you are there and the only drawback is that management often gives their employees too much to do within the shift making job completion difficult. Most of the co-workers are cool and the management is decent. Everyone is trained so the job goes smoothly most of the time.

good,"Working at Wal-mart was a great experience. It has has allowed me to gain outstanding customer service skills, intrapersonal communication skills and great work ethics. When workin at Wal-mar I also was able to work all around the store in area's such as; jewelry counter,sales floor, phone receptionist,backroom, 3rd shift stocking and fitting room. The most enjoyable part about working at wal-mart would be the versatility. I had the chance to work all around the store performing all types of duties. The hardest part would be the schedule. The schudule was so hard to keep up with and it was hard to manage with everyday life."
good,"A typical day at work for me at wal-mart: I was kept busy, there was never a dwell moment. I loved to interact with the customers and my team members in the deli. I learned how to mulitask and work under pressure. My co-workers were very friendly and very helpful to me if I needed help. The hardest part of my job at wal-mart was being under staffed causeing alot of our customers to get upset. The most enjoyable part was meeting poeple evryday"
good,"A typical day at work is prepping, baking, and wrapping breads. Stocking the floor with freight, in order to maintain an effective shopping experience for customers. Frosting and decorating, custom cakes, and back stock. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a customer happy. The hardest part of my job is when you try to help a customer and no matter what you do to try to help them, they still don't seem satisfied. Management can sometimes be difficult to work with, they get too involved with their jobs, and sometimes forget to pay attention to their associates needs."
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping the customer, cleaning up the store, and stocking and organizing departments as the day progresses. This has been a unique experience for me as everyday has its differences a customer looking for something special and or a new manager trying to figure his/her way around. The co-workers generally are very helpful as I would go out of my way to help they would too. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep the customer happy. There is always on any given day at least one customer that expects you to personally take care of them and make sure everything is right with the world in there eyes."
good,"Co-workers are very divers."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was an great place to work somewhat in other area's were maybe a little hard but I made it made around  it & things went just right.
good,It was a pleasure coming to work on a daily basis. The people I worked with was always friendly and enjoyable to be around. It was always busy and the customers were always so kind no matter what and understanding.
good,come in to work happy and stay happy most of the day till my feet start hurting. what i learned from this job is you have to have patient with your customer or you will never get far in this type of work. management need alot of work. loved me co-worker every good people work love to work with them again.
good,"Love the breaks, management was ok, hours was good, co-workers was fun and friendly"
good,"Loved working for walmart, I am a hard worker, give customer service and  love helping people."
good,"I belive that working in the vision center at Walmart is completely different than working in any other department.  My manager listened to new ideas and was very accomidating when she could be to the needs of the staff and the vision center as a whole.  My coworkers and I got along well with each other and made a great team.  I thoroughly ejoyed getting up and going to work every day because I knew the team as whole would do well and make the day not only profitable, but fun."
good,I liked working at Walmart because of the relationships that were built. Everyone that I worked with was like family. The hardest part of my job was trying to adapt to all the new changes.
good,A typical day at the distribution center is like any other. You come in and get your goal for the day and we try to exceed that goal. I have learned that competition is praised at the center. The managers will push to get their numbers up. Co-workers are fun especially when goals are exceeded. The hardest part of the job was explaining why the daily goal wasn't met. And the most enjoyable part of the job is of course making and exceeding your goal.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is switching departments learning different jobs.
good,"-Work was a long day"
good,"complete full day activity with job and fun ,"
good,"Productive and fun place to work "
good,"Clocked in and immediately started helping people. Managers were always on schedule. Co-workers were nice, supportive, and caring. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is always busy and always fast moving, and because of Wal-Mart, I have learned many skills in the store so that I can help customers and make them satisfied. I have little supervisor experience, and because of that experience, I am able to step up and help a supervisor if he or she is behind on their work. Many of my co-workers are hard-working and fast-paced as well as I. Some of them do not want to work the schedules they are given and they only want to work the day shift. I never get many chances to work day shift and I am always stuck working mid shift or second shift. That is fine by me though. It is always so busy and especially on the weekends, the front end is always backed up and all register trained associates are required to come up and help get the customers checked out and about their business. A lot of times we are told to do something, and have to stop what we are doing, and sometimes we do not finish what we started because of all the other things that need to be done. I have had a hard time getting management to notice my accomplishments and the things I do because I would like to advance to a higher position."
good,"Walmart its a good place to work but the managers need more commitment, with the Company, and also more education, they need to be more focus in the store and company values Instead  to micromanager the employees."
good,"Service customers vehicle and inform customers of best decisions for their vehicle, clean and maintain shop. Help where as need through out store."
good,good liked working for the company the work area is fast pace really enjoyed it
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart. The Woodbridge Location was awesome, with great coworkers and management to deal with the rough customer base. In contras, the Warrenton location was management horridly, with dept manager not communicating with their superiors, all the way up the chain of command. Frequently fixing mistakes because of this."
good,"A typical day at work stocking shelves ,working sporting goods, cashiering,helping customer all day. At times it became very stressful cause I was trained in different areas and management spread me really thin,i work every department I could. I was over worked and underpaid. I enjoyed my co-worker and most of management was awesome,just no room to advance.. So I choose to go off to college to become a certified Medical Assistant...."
good,"good job, good hrs, management pulled sleeves up and helped as needed..."
good,"A typical day at Walmart really depends on what week it is and what day it is in that specific week.  My responsibilities ranged from dealing with customer service to inventory management.  In this job I learned that there are many guidelines on how to deal with customers; however, you have to deal with them per situation.  Walmart, just like any customer service job, likes to be very customer friendly and make the customer feel special.  Management is very understanding of the associates needs and try and make you feel part of a team, which I really enjoy.  My co-workers could be a little hard to work with, as some did not adopt a team attitude, and would only really look out for themselves and not the company.  I would say the hardest part of the job would be balancing the work schedule, and trying to get all your work done on top of taking care of customers.  On the other hand, an enjoyable part would also be the customers.  I've had great experience with some of them, and when they come back they always ask for me."
good,great job worked over nights stocking everyone was nice and friendly.
good,"Wal-mart is a very busy company . Expect to work every hour that your there.They have a nice hour break for lunch and allow you to leave the facility ,which is quite enjoyable.The holiday season is the Hardest part of the job.Some days 13 pallets of inventory will arrive in one night and you have certain times to finish. The co-workers are great and all work as a Team to help each-other if needed."
good,Got to know alot of people that became like family to me.worked in alot of differnt areas of the front end. was noticed for my abilities. and was given a seconary poisition..
good,"Walmart is a fun and great place to work, and make friends, I learned how to sell Walmart rewards mastercards, and handle money on a daily basis. Also how to handle with difficult situations whether it be a customer or another situation. I always love the people I work with, they are what makes a job fun and easy, the hardest part of the day is knowing you may have at least one incident with a customer or associate, but you always know someone in management is there to help and that's what keeps me going."
good,"-stock merchandise"
good,"  A typical shift at Wal-Mart began with unloading the grocery truck, breaking down most pallets by aisle onto rollable carts for easier stocking.  I was usually assigned one of the more basic aisles such as paper or cereal, or else set to refilling and/or changing features.  I learned a good bit about store-level logistics and Wal-Mart's inventory control process, and where and how that process could break down.  Management was mostly positive, however they were given somewhat unrealistic expectations to hand down to us.  My co-workers were mostly good, steady people, able to keep the freight moving and stock their designated aisle within the shift.  Unfortunately, high turnover and inconsistent expectations from above meant that we were often asked, over and over, to do more with less.  The best part of the job was that each night, we had a way to measure progress (how much freight was left), whereas in more directly customer-oriented positions, there are no such markers."
good,"Working in the Walmart environment was a bit tough at times, some days were a bit more complex then others, but in the end it was still a business that was always achieving excellent performance. The hardest part of working their at times was when the store was busy, you surely needed to be on your toes on days like those, but their were also days when things were superb, service, work ethic, cooperation & communication throughout all employee's, it was a pleasure working for the Walmart Family"
good,"I mostly had a good work experience in the Walmart family-I do enjoy interacting with others, and I had a good chance to do that with Walmart. In most cases management was always helpful and fair.Some days could be very stressful on a courtesy desk, as customers can be a bit demanding, but mostly you could share a joke- or a bit of info. That was always good to see a smile as they left."
good,"great place, very fast paced work environment. Great people, great atmosphere. would recommend this business to anyone.. greeted customers,stocked shelves,"
good,"Once at work we get ready and set up to unload the trucks in the back. Organizing each in a specific category (like frozen, dairy, etc.). At a certain time we will deliver everything out for the stockers to put up in their certain places. Afterwards, we are supposed to pick out the merchandise that is needed on the floor. Also, we assist the manager to do other errands that are needed to be done. Clean up our area before the time we are assigned to leave."
good,i love working here i get a long with everyone and learn a alot each and everyday i go in to work.A typical day at work is stocking daily to give customers a variety of merchandise to pick from also helping people on a one on one basics.
good,"Working a Wal-Mart was a great experience, as it gave me the opportunity to work with many different people on a daily basis.  A typical day at work included organizing merchandise, updated pricing and assisting with customer concerns and questions."

good,"un día normal como todos iba camino a mi trabajo todo parecía normal llegue a mi puesto de trabajo como cajero lo recuerdo bien yo estaba cobrando a un cliente cuando de pronto se me acerco mi jefe de cajas me dijo que apagara mi caja que me ocupaban en  recursos humano pues sin preguntar hice lo que se me ordeno cuando entre pues medio una sorpresa inolvidable que era el nuevo supervisor ese día fue muy importante para mi por que desde ese día e aprendido muchas habilidades tales como la del liderazgo y administración del personal."
good,"As a cashier my day consisted of clocking in, counting the amount of money in my till with supervision to ensure that everything was correct. I would then make sure my area was clean, and had enough bags before I began taking customers. I would then assist by helping customers find certain items, answering any questions they had about on going sales, ring and bag groceries, tender cash, credit, debit, and check transactions as well as helping customers with items out to their car, and on occasions I would greet customers at the door when entering and exiting the store in addition to helping them retrieve shopping carts. While working at Wal-Mart I learned to improve my multi-tasking skills. Management was always on top of things as far as asking them for extra training if needed. I limited myself to very minimal interaction with co-workers to keep from being apart of the ""daily drama"". The hardest part of the job was getting customers to respect the fact that your register was going to be closing and you could not take anymore customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with new and old customers on a daily basis."
good,"A very family oriented place to work for. Busy, never a dull moment. People is great, and fun. Stocks are always in the high note is a must to be involved if you like making money."
good,"On my average day at Walmart, I greet every customer with great customer service and a smile. I make sure that the front-end is clean to company standards. I set up merchandise on the sales floor, explain merchandise to customers. Send money to other states, countries and locally. I consistently embrace learning and growing as an associate, whether on the Telxon, the sales floor, or the warehouse. "

good,"I enjoy working at walmart not only because is a store where I like going shopping, but its a job where you get to give good customer service to customers and treat them the way you like to be treated."
good,KFC allowed me my first experience in a supervisory role. I learned values and work ethic that I still use today.
good,"I enjoy my job at walmart, but i want a second job to help occupy mine time, take care of my finances, and most importantly better myself."
good,"Working the midnight shift as a stocker, responsibilities include getting product, organizing in on the sales floor in it's proper place."
good,"A typical day for me would be filling at least 400 prescriptions. My management wasn't terrible, and they tried to work with us. I learned a lot about working with a team from Walmart. I always try to be the entertaining person who maintains stamina and positive attitudes."
good,"A typical night at work would be myself and my co-workers working together each night to make sure the store was stocked by morning."
good,this is where i learned to strip & wax i enjoyed working with my co-works the hardest part of the work was keeping customers off the wet wax
good,this job was one of the worst jobs I have ever held...the customers love to cry to the managers at walmart because they could get things for free and walmart would stick up for them but dont want to give the same people anything free from their department
good,fast pace place to work with lots of change so you don't get bored in one job 
good,"An overall review of the job is that it is pretty easy going, of course there is some hardships as is every job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pleasant customers and putting a smile on their face, the hardest part of the job is, when something isnt ready on time and a customer has to wait and seein them upset."
good,"Typical day was to clock in and helped as much as I could without getting paid for it. Sometimes I felt like I was the supervisor when my supervisors came to ask me how things were done or how to do them on a register/returns/exchanges/money center."
good,The people were nice there and management knew what they were doing. At walmart you have to take great safety measures also due to either employees or customers being able to get hurt from spills or messes.
good,I enjoyed my time with Walmart.  I learned some many new skills that I use everyday in every position that I have had since I left walmart.  This was a great place to work.
good,"Walmart was a busy busy place to work, very consistent and fast paced. I learned how to pace myself & work smart not hard. "
good,"Okay place to work at, not one of the best. A typical day of work consist of what managers tell you to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is your hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks."
good,The job was very good. A busy day was a good day and in some ways a bad day. Customers complain but it is easy to solve their problems by understanding what they need while holding a smile on your face.
good,"I am a highly motivated individual who's a leader and works well with others. I have a great work ethic and I am a great asset to those I work for. A typical day of work for me consists of providing quality customer service, which seems to be lacking in most businesses today. I am energetic and vibrant with an eagerness to learn more, to do more, to become more. I look forward to assisting others in any way that I can. I would say that that is the highlight of my day. "
good,"The tasks were pretty much repetitious, which was mainly restocking and block facing the shelf items. Not much i've learned that I haven't from other places of employment, other than how to properly dispose of certain hazardous materials. Management were approachable and fair. Had no problems with any coworkers at all, despite a wide group of different personalities. The hardest part of the job was when employees wouldn't show, which would spread into a more strenuous workload. Most enjoyable part was the group of well-natured people."
good,"I loved working with the customers and my direct supervisors. I learned a lot of customer service and how to run the register. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers, but the satisfaction of helping them was great. "
good,opened boxes then put them on the shelves helped customers with anything they need
good,"Getting to the store, and getting Customer Service cleaned up and ready to go for the business day ahead is, for important to me. My cashier is usually there shortly after that. I talk with her, make sure she's set for the day and that she is doing good. I do this with all my cashier's. I want them to know that they are cared for and valued. They are happy it will show in their customer service to customer's. I find that with my co-worker's if I remain positive, then everyone else does as well. Thing's happen. The store manager may have issues that roll down and  may eventually land on me not always but occasionally this happens. But when I reflect that to my cashiers it does them no good. My smile goes on and so does my day. Myself and my direct co worker's may not always see eye to eye. But we compromise and work thing's out and don't have big issue that need to go beyond that.. My most enjoyable part of the day is when I get to tell my cashier's Thanks for all your help today you did great and give them a high five."
good,"I enjoyed working with the public,my co-workers were great, we all worked as a team, managment would listen to  any concerns, everyday your busy from start to finish, I was always thinging what needed to be done for the next day when I went home. It was fun and"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart starts with cleaning up my department and send items back to the warehouse. The things I learned was able to know when an item is damage or not. The hardest part of the job is not having everyone on the same page, everyone wants to be the leader all the time. What I enjoy about the job is been able to save the store some money."
good,Boa empresa para trabalhar que possui bastante crescimento profissional.
good,"when your a sales associate working on the floor you pretty much have to keep your department zoned (neat and presentable), keep items stocked, help customers and pull stuff from the back. help build displays. most likely going to have to help in other departments every once if a while. The thing that I didn't like most about the job is if your cash register trained they're most likely gonna call for help at least once everyday which can make it hard to get things done in your department because you can be up there for more than an hour. assistant store managers expected way too much, but zones mangers were very friendly and helpful.  "
good,"Wall Mart is a good place to work. They have values ,benefits & job security."
good,the best part of my job is organizing and keeping my station clean and the worst part of my day is no recognition
good,go into work look over what you need make a list if needed. go to the back fill up your cart figure out what your coworkers are working on to see what all has to be done. go to floor fill and cull your area to make sure its the best for the customers. the hardest part of work is coming in when you close and having to finish everyone else's work on top of your own. otherwise nothings that hard to do. I enjoy coming to work with my coworkers and getting a lot done I feel so happy when stuff im support to do plus some gets done. I hate not getting stuff done.
good,"A typical Day at Walmart inc for a Sales Associate would require fast pased, Good communication Skills, ability to Solve problems under pressure. Zoning Department as well as putting away returns, and constantly dealing with customers. At busy times you are expected to be well rounded in all departments and help up front as a cashier. At the end of your shift you are expected to have great quality of work."
good,"Awesome company to work for, never had any problems very understanding managers and co-workers very down to earth, Friendly environment."
good,"I loved working here. Amazing team work, great management, lots of on the job training. The only reason I left is I wanted to further my education and find something stable. Also I dreamed of working in health care making a difference in someone's life. Co workers were very supportive. Hardest part of my job was the long hours. Most enjoyable part was everyday was a challenge, everyday there was something new and different brought to the company. Always room to grow and learn something new. "
good,"I clock in, get my Gemini and Printer. Walk to my side of the store. Log in to my Gemini and start processing the carts of product that are sitting in my area. Then at 9:00am I take over for the other associate while they are on lunch. That job is Receiving the goods that the vendors bring in to our store to sell. Then when the other associate comes back from lunch, an hour later, then I go to a 15 min. break. Then I come back and try to finish my area before the other associate leaves for the day. At 12:00 I go to lunch for my hour. After lunch I stop by the UPC office and get my papers that come off the printer. I take these papers and staple them to the receipts in the tray on the desk. these papers have to match exactly what the receipts say. Then I get ready to unload one or two trucks. "
good,A workplace with exciting benefits but not a strong management team.
good,Working in the pharmacy is very productive but its what makes the job fun.I learn new things every day.Its busy everyday and for the week we fill close to 4000 presciptions.The most part what I like about my job is the customers and working with my coworkers.
good,"With 18 stores, each having different opportunities, you had to handle multiple situations daily."
good,I was responsible for running my register & occasionally help push shopping carts.
good,I keep the shelves stocked. I learned to keep track of stock how to make sure the on hand stock count is correct. Management is good at making sure I have what I need to do my job. co-workers works well with me keeping everything stocked. The hardest part is working in the freezer for more than 5 too 10 mins. at a time. The most enjoyable part is the more work the faster the time go.
good,"typical day is a busy fast paced work day"
good,Empresa bem conceituada. Prioriza o bom atendimento aos clientes. Prega muito forte entre seu funcionários sua cultura e oferece boas oportunidades de crescimento.
good,"come in unload trucks, restock shelves. very educatetional,managers very helpful, co-workers assist you when needed.hardest part of job, when trucks get backed up,everyone helps out.                                                           "
good,"I learned better customer service management skills, how people moods change depending their customer service, Management was not that great because they didn't always want to interact with the customer unless absolutely necessary, My co-workers were some of the best people I have ever worked with and some of us are still friends even though I'm not working there."
good,"J'aimais bien aidé les clientes dans leurs choix de produits cosmétiques. Par contre ce que j'ai le moin aimé, c'est lorsqu'on m'a donné une augmentation mais qu'on m'a coupé des heures. Alors où est l'augmentaiton ???"
good,"After clock in and tasking the entire day is somewhat slow, and occasionally quick. We unload the truck(s), stack the palletes with the appropriate items, pull the pallaetes to designated areas an when it finally slows down either stocking, inventory, or unloading frozen for the night."
good,had a good time got in shape real quick but no room for advancement
good,"made a lot of friends, loved working for this Store Manager, I met this store Manager when I started in Newport, very nice man, his store are always Clean, Friendly employees"
good,"Aprendi muito nesta empresa, pois foi meu primeiro emprego!"
good,The company overall was a very good place to work.  I learned alot of skills from this job.  My market manager always made sure that I had all the training and tools i needed to do my job.  My co-workers were great and so were all my employees.  The hardest part of the job sometimes were getting ready for yearly inventories.
good,"A typical day consists of clocking in and being assigned a register. While at your register you will be responsible for accurately and efficiently checking customers out, bagging their items, and making the process as pleasant as possible because as a cashier you are one of the last persons the customers come into contact with. If you work four hours or more you are entitled to one fifteen minute break while if you work over 6 hours you are entitled to a fifteen minute break and a lunch. WalMart is a fun, but fast paced place to work.I have learned to be patient and responsible. I enjoyed talking to customers about different things while checking them out and making sure there shopping trip was great. "
good,"I loved interacting with my customers, I got to stock the shelves and prepare for inventory and ring customers merchandise up and I really enjoyed working layaway"
good,"I am lucky I get along with my co-workers.I have learned a lot in the training class.Management,usually always tries to work well with the employees.The hardest part of the job, there is none. Most enjoyable part would be knowing I did my job well, in a timely and error free work. Allowing me to feel good about my work."
good,"Walmart was a wonderful environment to work in. A typical day was coming in at various hours everyday never really knowing what the next weeks schedule would look like. I loved my co-workers and the majority of my managment. The mangagment however didnt have a very good handle on making us feel appriciated, needed, or important. The hardest part about this job was dealing with the lack of having a life outside of my job. It was nearly imposible to find time for anything else due to the lack of a common schedule. The most enjoyable was my co-workers by far. The greatest people I've ever meant. "
good,"muito bom"
good,It was a great place to work. Most customers was friendly and my your job worth coming to.
good,"I love the diversity that I was exposed to and all of the families made the job worth going to, a very learning experience."
good,"work life balance schedule is the best part of the job, when your on your rotation hours are long, 12 - 14 hrs days or nights. Managment must be able to be hands on to be succesful. Many levels of management. "
good,"A gente trabalhava em equipe tbém, para organização do fechamento"
good,"its steady work. I've learned inventory control, and a lot about corporate america."
good,"Good place to work, at first it's allot of stuff to deal with but as you go you pick up on allot. Good people for the most part, just do what your supposed to do and you'll be fine."
good,"I had learned a lot from working retail and it has taught me how to deal with people in a more professional way. I have learned how to satisfy the most unhappy customer with just being attentive to what they have to say and to come to a solution that would please them in there situation. a day at work was always fun, I would make my customers laugh and they would make me laugh. Most of my managers were easy going but firm and some were just rude and mean. Co-workers were just easy to work, and talk with very encouraging and caring. I do not have any hard part of the job, the most enjooyable was just going and having a good day with the customers."
good,I enjoyed it. the management at the time could have been better. The workers there were great people to word with. Usually the hardest part of the job to clean up the finished the day after a large truck day.
good,I can say that the hardest part of this job is the overnight shift. 
good,i loved my job at walmart. my coworkers were fun and amazing to work with. We had a lot of good times and bad times the work was easy once you got used to it.
good,"Good work environment, friendly staff. Definitely enjoyable for anyone who loves electronics. Good hours, reasonable pay. Definitely helps  build social skills for anyone who lacks them since you have to approach and talk to people wither it be customers, fellow employees, etc."
good,"Walmart is an ok place to work. Simple advice is not to let your managers know how hard of a worker you can be, or else they will take advantage of you. This will burn you out quick and the pay is not work it."
good,I have learned how to use the cash register and all the codes at Walmart. The people i worked with weren't as helpful as i needed when i started. Most enjoyable part of my time at Walmart would be meeting the regular people that come in and see you every other day.
good,"I enjoyed my job and my customers, but i felt no team work. At times i felt like I did the work while my fellow csm's did nothing, but it,s ok cause my customers come first."
good,"Clock in, then you put your hair net on also make sure to wash your hands also put on your apron. Then I would make sure the slicers are  clean and start helping customer if there are any, if not I'd see if there is anything that needs to be cooked to refresh the Hot Case. Then I would take a look at the list were all my co-workers and my name would be to see what my department manger would like me to get done that day. I have Learned How to deal with all types of people and how they like things and how to help put a smile on someones face if they have had a hard day, people love to talk to me and I love to talk to them. I have a wonderful time with my co- workers love how we are all different and we all bring so many hard working skills to the job and we all make each other laugh and test each others skills.I think the hards part would have to be getting yelled at sometimes by customers but you have to smile and say have im sorry you feel that way is there anything else I can do for you, have a wonderful day. My most enjoyable part is also customers at the same time cause you get to hear all these wonderful things that people tell you well your helping them. I just love to help people and talk to them and I think I'm looking for new ways to do so."
good,"You will find yourself working multiple jobs through out your day. Most floor associates are helping in 3 or more departments at once. Often communication opportunities are missed because of the fast paced work load.  I have learned to be as communicative with my fellow associates and management as possible. Our customers can be the most challenging in the area; but you get your regulars and they are always awesome. I enjoy working with customers and helping them find the best value for what they are looking for in our store. My fellow associates are the best part of the day, though. We are all everyday average people working to get by. To put it simply: it takes a special kind of person to enjoy working in a customer service job like ours."
good,"worked hard to unload trucks"
good,"Walmart overall is an excellent company to work for. The staff is extremely friendly and accepting, and always willing to help. "

good,Stocking food and helping customers find what they want in the store.
good,"Extremely Friendly Environment, the associates of the facility made the job a fun place to be daily."

good,"I  first started as a cashier and moved to the Money Center.  I came in organized my cash drawer and straightened work area.  I learned how to cash payroll checks, MoneyGram transactions and the products that we sold.  I give management a 4 out of 10.  My team members and I worked well together.  The hardest part of my job was keeping all our products straight and organized within the Money Center.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job was pleasing and meeting the customers."
good,"If you are looking to work for a company that believes in paying you for your time, training, store bonuses, and a dollar extra for working on Sundays then WalMart is for you. Walmart is a great company to work for. The only exception is 95% you are at work instead of at home with your family. When I worked for Walmart, I hated to stuck on the 2-10pm,3-11pm, and 4-12pm shifts...I was at work all day long. Other than that, you get a raise after your 90 days and a raise every year. Good company!"
good,good work place but not big on team work. Some mangers didn't know field of work

good,This was a summer job I had. The pay was great. The only problem was having to stand all day.
good,I really enjoyed the work atmosphere because I love working with people so being a cashier was great. The co-workers were also very nice and helpful in any way they could be. The hours were good and the management was also very good. I liked how they put their schedules out three months in advance also.
good,Frequent relocations required. Employees were great asset to company at this location
good,Easy overall job when you have enough people at work to complete tasks. Managers are average. Most enjoyable part of work was getting off.
good,Work 11 hour days in the -20 temperatures to to provide the customer with their groceries.
good,"I really didnt work there very long, but from what I say the management was kind of off just a little."
good,Days consist of taking trying to get every customer in and out in a timely manner while making sure they were happy and satisfied. This position taught me how to be more flexable with my time as well as emphasizing on the necesasity for working safe. The hardest part of my job would have to be not being able to fix everyones issue due to company policy. I do understand why and how the policies have to be in effect. But sometimes the policies dictate why we cannot work on a certian vehilce. The most enjoyable part of this job for me was fixing an issue for a customer.
good,"The job isn't terribly difficult but they will work you every day and any day they need you. I made some nice friends there and enjoyed my time working with my co-workers. On the negative side, they will not hold your job for you if you have a medical issue unless you've been there for over a year."
good,Working at walmart had its good days and its bad. I Ioved working with the other employees and made many life long friends. The customers weren't always easy to deal with but the friends I made and the fun I had on the job made up for it. I absolutely loved my manager. I would still be working there if it weren't for personal issues that came up that conflicted the job.
good,"Work days are fast paced, I have learned basic retail management, co workers some nice some not, the hardest part of job is the work load, I mloved meeting new people"

good,"It was a paycheck. Nothing more nothing less. You go to work, you sweat. and put in your time. if you want to get ahead than you gotta put the work in for it. Your earned your place in the job. You earned everything. I always went in with a humble attitude. And I always went in to work."
good,"Since Wal-Mart gave me a job when jobs where tough to find I am grateful, Having said that I have seen too many things to ignore the lack of associate recognition for the efforts they make. Pride in doing a outstanding job is all most totally gone. I love my job, I just disagree with some of the politics of Wal-Mart."
good,"A Day as a cashier at walmart, well as managment gos i didn't really see much of them. co-workers all very nice and helped anytime i needed them. the hardest part i would say is, its very fasted past but for me not to hard, i liked all the differnt customers i talked to. over all good place to work."

good,You Learn How To Work With The Public
good,"Running the register, getting things customers needed. I learned how to run the register, management was great! There was never a conflict with any of my co-workers, the only thing that would be annoying would be a really late shift/really early shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home after a hard day's work!"
good,"Walmart was a great way for me to get a taste of the real world. I worked as a cashier and had a very flexible schedule. I learned how to process monetary and check/credit card transactions and a lot about who I am as a person. The managers tried to balance what was best for the company as well as what was best for the workers. I would say the more difficult part of my job was not having a steady work schedule, but working with the public was always fun and rather rewarding for me."
good,"Management at Wal-mart was a little different from anywhere else I have been a manager at before. AT Wal-Mart you were in charge of people, but you didn't have the power to recognize their achievements or discipline them when there was a mistake. All of my co-workers were very friendly and I still say hi to them when I go there shopping."
good,A job that offers both physical and mental demands.
good,Normal day starts with a short meeting with management to focus on problem areas. Management is willing to work with employees to maximize productivity and abilities. Co-workers arise from varied backgrounds and levels of education and experiences.

good,"Typical day consists of clocking in a 8am, grabbing my telxon (scanner), finding my Department manager so she can give me my tasks of the day. I work 8 hour shifts, 40 hours a week. I do alot of repetition with picking up 5 to 70 lb. boxes. Pulling pallets with pallet jacks. I love the people I work with. I believe its not right to say anything negative about a job, but I feel as though that the management staff can perform better. I work hard, more than what I get paid for and I feel as though they don't."
good,"I have filled various positions in my time with Walmart, from cashier to Front End Manager and everything in between., including Personnel Manager for a store of 300+ associates."

I learned about inventory, operating a cash register and a POS system. I also learned how to work in a busy, face paced environment and keep a steady work pace My co workers and management were incredible. Its was a family oriented atmosphere and everyone worked as one. The hardest part about the job working short handed on busy days. The part of the job i enjoyed the most was working as a team in a friendly environment, interacting with the customers, and there was opportunity to advance with the company"
good,"A typical work day is to open: hook up slicers, pull out of dates, throw floor mats, whatever was out have prepped by ten am before store manager walked the floor, load rotisserie ovens etc.,"
good,"At Walmart you will learn a lot about customer service and how customers react to various situations that come up. You have to be patient with customers and be able to problem solve. At times managment can be hard to get along with but overall they are very understanding and the ""open door"" policy is a great benefit. Walmart pays decent wages and has a very good benefits package with 401k and stock purchase options."
good,Walmart is a great job for those who are young and would like to build thier work history. Walmart is a very fast past envirment with a broad range of personalities. i ould recommend this job as a life long career but overall it is a decent job.

I also did most of the register training for new employees, My co-workers were great to work with. I had a great time working there which is important.

Always under close surveillance by management. Never really talked to them unless they were questioning me and my work ethic. Co-workers and I got along very well. No problems between any of us. Time frame from beginning to end was incredibly short depending on how much stock you had to put up. Sometimes the managers would cook for us whenever we surpassed quota for the month"

good,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart is just an average day at grocery and everyday needs store. It may start off slow and get busy and vise versa. I learned quite a bit working here, the financial part, patience, true customer care. Management was okay. When things got chaotic, the managers would lose their cool some times, but I think everyone has been overwhelmed at times. Hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for hours at a time, depending how busy we are. And Wal-Mart is always busy. I enjoyed the comradeship from my coworkers and meeting and helping new people."

good,"I typical work day is finishing whatever volume of orders you have much like any warehouse. Communication lacks at times but it's everyone's responsible to challenge and assist that to make the company better as a whole. For the most part management does a good job, like anywhere there's room for improvement. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the long hours and breakdowns in communication, also can be highly physical. The most enjoyable part of the job is the amazing people you get to meet through it all."

good,I learned how to manage people in a fast paced building. You manage a melting pot of associates and you have to be able to navigate through differences easily. Performance based on stores sales goals and profit line.
good,A typical day at work is coming in and finding out my task for the evening. I've learned that each night at Walmart brings something new. Management allows me to do what I need to do in my area. Some co-workers work harder than others. The hardest part about working at Walmart is sometimes not getting done on time. The enjoyable part of the job is being recognize for all my hard work.

good,"I learned so much with Walmart. Everything a manager needs to do/learn?know they will cover during a typical day in a Walmart DC.

The distribution center in Virginia I worked in was a wonderful place to be and would recommend it to anyone interested in that type of management or hourly work."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be me coming into work and unloading the meat/produce truck. I would pull the whole truck with a manual forklift and place them into coolers.

good,"There was no typical day at wal-mart. Issues evolved every day. Some good and some bad. Learned several things as an assistant such as merchandising, inventory control, how to supervise department managers as well as associates on the floor. I worked well with my associates and was involved in every aspect of the departments.

good,Working for this company it was always busy and always something to do. I learned something new almost every day.

good,"my typical work day includes helping customers and management alike, weather it be setting up product end caps or features as well as talking to a customer about where certain products are or if we have any thing that is not on the shelf is in our back storage room or not. I have learned that this job does have its perks, helping people, seeing the smiles on their faces makes me TRULY happy and delighted that even though i told this person where a jar of mayo was after searching the store for 30 minutes that she can go home and cook a meal for her family and doing something so small for someone can change if not put their day back on track and every time that happens i feel better about myself. Management is decently strict which is something every place needs, they have a lot on their plate and while their always busy they do help with your problems and questions. Even if they are busy they will sometimes if not always try to at least talk to you about something bothering you or affecting your work schedule. My co-workers are as different as the different colors in a rainbow. Some are nice and some are difficult to handle and deal with, teamwork is something i love to be involved in and something i feel necessary especially in retail i ALWAYS find myself asking someone else who knows more about if a product is gluten free or where exactly moisturizing cream is. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is picking up the slack for other departments or just the sudden negative situations that is GOING to happen at this job like customers having a temper just because of store"
good,"I day at work is the ringing of customers,standing at the front of the asile trying to keep eyes on customers lookin for an open registers when we aren,t busy.The co-workers are all pretty friendly and helpful.There are diff. levels and ways of management and our management team rotates every few months,so the personalities rotate.Customer service is a hand full so i do think u have to be a people person and do hands on to keep up with all that goes on in that area.Wal.mart allow you to change and upgrade to different departments."

The hardest part of my job was having difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was having customers that made your day go by faster just by making you enjoy your job.
good,I really enjoyed working for Walmart. I learned a lot about merchandising and retailing in general. The management team could have been more considered of the employee with the expectation that they had. I really love most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get things done in the time expected. This was hard because I would want everything in its place before I left and that usually required a bit more time.

good,"I am currently employed at Wal Mart Distribution Center in Opelousas, LA. A typical day at work consist of arriving at work, warming up, stretching, report to your assigned work area, and begin duties. Duties include filling boxes with the freight to be prepared for store delivery and working safely. Management can seem sometimes as if they aren't understanding , but they eventually solve any issues that you may come across. The hardest part of the job is making production during slow days, but it just pushes me to work harder. The most enjoyable part of the job is being part of a team that makes it worth going in to work."
good,"A typical day at this work is very repeatative. I've learned how to catch myself from day dreaming, and I also learned how to a hold a conversation with strangers without those awkward silences. The managment is ok. Its not the best or the worst,at this walmart you'll be lucky with far more considerate and friendly bosses then cold ones. Its almost like high school though with the coworkers, no matter how old they get they still have plenty to gossipe about. The hardest part of the job is beating the boredom and keeping focused. There are some customers that come in just wanting to argue, which I always found very odd. But if you keep thinking positive and keep reminding yourself there are far worse jobs its not all that bad. The most enjoyable part of the job I found were getting groceries out to peoples cars. The ones that needed the carry out were so interesting and characters. They made me laugh."

good,Review the cashier list for the day and begin assigning job for the day.
good,"WalMart was a fun place to work. A typical day would include just standing at your register, cleaning when you didn't have anybody in line, and being friendly. I made my way to third shift which involved the regular duties of a second shift cashier as well as replacing items on the shelf that were returned to the service desk throughout the day. Management never explained things too clearly and was sometimes very rude. WalMart prided itself on friendliness, which it seemed to uphold to customers but not employees."
good,"Coworkers and most management are great people to work with. Some management take the title more seriously than the people that they work with sometimes making it difficult to advance. Overall a great place to work and very enjoyable with understanding personnel department. Very clear cut responsibilities, arrive to work clock in and immediately begin working on pre set tasks. I learned how to adapt to different individuals within different settings and situations. The hardest part of the job is the ungrateful attitudes of many customers. the most enjoyable part is getting to know coworkers and break time with them."
good,This job was extremely fast paced. I was able to meet many new people. Most customers were great to talk with and co-workers were fun to work with.

good,Working overnight we would throw freight and race each other to see who could do more in the shortest amount of time.
good,As a sales associate I found Walmart a fun place to work. All employees provided outstanding customer service. Sometimes management did not provide enough people to do the work required. I do not feel management provided edequate training.
good,"I loved my job at walmart, but when the new store manager took over, the whole value of the store went down dramatically."
good,Did not train me for some of the work they wanted me to do. Did not pay me the same rate as they would a cashier from a sales associate. I got along with all of my co-workers.
good,"My daily tasks are to perform an EPC audit in the morning, work on merchandise counts, perform audits, and provide customer service. I also have to make sure my merchandise in the men's department is refreshed and zoned. There are about seven sales associates that I have to supervise. There really isn't a ""hard part"" to my job, but some situations that come up with a customer's concerns or a customer's complaint can become difficult and challenging. I like most of the people I work with, and I am very pleased with our management team. What I love about my job are the learning experiences. I always learn something new everyday and it makes me even better at performing my tasks."
good,"es biuen travajo de planta te dan seguro,infonavit, fonacot,descanso"

good,Good assoicates to work with. Learned the operation of running a big retail store.
good,"Greet and interact with customers,"
good,I oversaw daily operations of the part of the store I was assigned. I met with my department managers and created game plan for the day. I followed up with them to ensure all tasks were being handled. I was able to go to other managers if I had questions. I also answered customer service questions as they would arise. The hardest part of the job was the long hours on my feet. It was literally 12 hours on my feet. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the people.
good,"Every night is a heavy load of duty for us maintenance team, being physically fit and mentally ready are basic requirements. My duty requires independence and cooperation. As a team we divide our work into sections, assigning different tasks for different individuals."
good,My co-workers were the best part of the job. long hours and short pay but the workers and family environment were my home away from home. loved working there even during the crazy holidays when customers werent so friendly. still worth it. <3
good,I go to work walk the floors I learned how to work the cash regester for the frist time. The management was pertty good when I didn't know something or I needed help on they helped me out. the co-workers was mostly to them selfs. The hards part about the job is wakeing up in the morning and talking to the co-workers in the morning. the most enjoyable part i seen eveyone and had alot of fun with walking and talking to others.
good,I loved making sure the customers could find what they needed and had a comfortable environment. They were always surrounded by people they were willing to help them. I loved my job and the coworkers were awesome to be around and to work with. Yea some were hard to work with but you going to have that everywhere you go. The hardest part about my job was keeping enough items on the shelf so the customers could shop and have fun doing it.
good,I saw many people coming and going in and around the store. I love seeing all the familiar faces and making new friends. Solving problems and giving satisfactory customer service made my day.
good,-Strong hours
good,"I help with unloading our frozen trucks that carry our freight, also I cook and keep the rotation of our products in the deli fresh and presentable to the customers. I have learned alot more about food saftey and the saftey with unloading trucks with forklifts. Managment is ok jus feel like some are doing their job and some are not. I get along with most of my coworkers, kinda like a big family. The hardest part of my job is the schedule rotation its not set but I make it work for me. The most enjoyable part is making the customers happy and making sure they want to come back and spend more money with the company."

good,great place to work.i would still be working there if i didnt have to leave for medical reasons
good,"very little chance to move in the company, a lot of management retaliation on employees,"
good,"Working for almost 9 years for this company was a life changing experiece. It was both very rewarding, and very challenging at times. When I first started, I did not expect myself to transform a regular cashier job into a respective management position with a great deal of responsibility. A typical day included the most important and fun part of my job which was practicing the ten-foot rule. Engaging with customers, asking them if they needed help,and providing each and every customer with an excellent customer service experience. All the duties, responsibilities, expectations, and daily tasks I was given, would not have been completed if it weren't for the passionate, hard-working, unique group of associates that I had the privaledge of managing. Every relationship I developed with fellow co-workers became a lifelong connection, and friendship. I still keep in touch with most of my previous management and past co-workers. All the skills and training I received at this job was ultimately important for any career or future job I may have. I would have to say that one of the most challenging experiences I encountered while working for this multi-billion dollar company was having to sometimes work during holidays and or special family events. As a previous employee of Walmart I learned the trade of the Retail Industry and its demands. I also learned the importance for providing customers with unmatched customer service while allowing them the opportunity to save money. Also I've implemented in my personal life something I would practice with great joy at my work, ""the golden rule"""
good,"i loved working here i just wish management would agree on certain rules and that the benefits were better for us , but all my co workers were nice and helpful"
good,"I loved getting to meet new people and seeing regular customers. I got to know some of my customers and their needs. Happy additude everyday at work, loved helping customers find the product they needed or couldn't find. I had fun while at work and made work enjoyable for the people who were having a bad day!"
good,"As a cake decorator I was responsible for stocking the front customer case, taking inventory, putting freight away, taking special orders, making special order cakes including wedding cakes, assisting guests with questions, assist in the bakery with bread prep and packaging, clean up, inventory and ordering. This job requires an incredible amount of multitasking, patience and guest service. There were many layers of management I needed to work with on a daily basis as well as a team of 4-8 bread department co-workers. I enjoyed providing the customers with a superior product and wonderful service they were sure to share with others. The hardest part about the job was learning Spanish as many of my customers were not able to speak English. However I learned quickly in order to assist my guests more efficiently."
good,"Busy days, Lots of customers always. Employees were nice and fun to work with. Gained alot of customer service experience working here"
good,"I helped customers, assembled bbq grills, and stocked products. I had great managers at both wal mart stores i worked at and the co-workers were fun to be around. Hardest part of the job was closing because we had stock shelves and pick up products that were on the floor and out of place. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Fast-paced, friendly environment. Ability to move throughout the store. Front end, office, food side, hardlines experience."

good,"great workplace,,excellent people and management..good opportunity to meet people and grow within the company"
good,"Fast paced days filled with customer service, counting and filling prescriptions."
good,"nothing exceptional here, but not horrible. management was kinda conceited but they are gone now, they give you a dept and leave you alone unless they need you to do a project. Electronics is, by far, the most hectic department."
good,"Earned 9.12 an hour, team members are fun depending on how you treat them, not really a hard job, holidaays are most fun."
good,Although I wouldn't personally desire that type of work again. Mainly bc of lack of pay/hrs. I got along with everyone and still do actually.
good,I was a cashier at wal-mart and a day at wal-mart is very simple clock-in and then wait at your register until u get customers.
good,A typical day at work is coming in to please the customer with our services and answering all questions adequately. The hardest part of work was knowing that i was not using my full potential in the position that i was in. The most enjoyable part was talking with the fellow coworkers.
good,"Bom atuava na área de carga e descarga de alimentos,objetos,etc.."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the pharmacy and how it runs. Management was great and very helpful with anything you needed. Co-workers were kind and also hard working. I learned a lot in the pharmacy department, such as billing information for health insurance, SIG codes for inputting for each prescription etc. The hardest part of the job would have to be the days we were understaffed and it would be tough to handle many things at once, but it was nothing I couldn't handle."
good,empresa con gran desarrollo y marcada pero dinamica diferenciacion en las tareas a desarrollarse en los diferentes departamentos que a ella pertenecen
good,"after clocking you, you log onto your register, turn on your register light and begin taking customers. you answer questions, cash them out, discuss products and their availability, etc. i had the advantage of assisting in customer service. management was very good at working with you on your schedules, and helping you in learning your job properly, relaying important information, and helping you do your job more efficiently and accurately. the hardest part was the business during the holidays and the most enjoyable was interacting with the customers and getting to talk to them while i cashed them out."
good,Go to work.
good,I enjoy the regular customers but have to work hard to keep up with all their visits. It is important to them to be remembered. All customers are greeted with a smile and a comment. My co-workers are excellent backing each other if there is ever a problem. Managers work to keep the job as stress free as possible. Everyone is a bit different but gets along great.
good,"Uma Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar , pois sua cultura vem de encontro com o meus princípios."
good,First I set up the cleaning cart with all the supplies. Then I clean the restrooms. After that I do all of the safty sweeps. Finaly I find a member of management and see if they need to do something else for the day or do more cleaning around the store.
good,management is on the rude side run freight and run register provide excellent customer service co workers are very nice learned that everything has its own place best part of the day was stocking
good,I love working with the customer making sure that they were satified and happy so that they would come back and shop with us again. Every co- worker wasnt like me they were lazy on they would tell the customer to go find someone else to help them. But I do feel that Wal-Mart is a very good place to work especially around the holidays. I work hard to make sure that the customer's are happy.
good,"Uma empresa boa de si trabalhar,mais atende mais pessoas que procuram um primeiro emprego,por nao ter muitas oportunidades de crescimento,outro fato e que a gerencia sempre esta em processo de mudança,assim os funcionarios perdem visibilidade."
good,"I do enjoy working with the amazing girls i have came to love, but there are not very many opportunities for advancement and i need to be able to prove i can be a great value to my employer."
good,"Un trabajo estable, con buena comunicacion. Poco tiempo de descanso y mucha presion en la limpieza y atencion al publico."
good,"Price changes, set modulars, process lots of freight, I learned how to stock shelves, the hardest part of the job is the physical requirements, the most enjoyable part of the job is that it is steady"
good,a typical day at work is coworkers cookin cleaning talking and having fun. managment was ok not that good but ok and my co workers was fun to be around and good workers. The hardest part of the job was really nothing and the most joyable part was being able to meet new people
good,"My day started out with the morning meeting followed by taking inventory and unloading the truck. Later I down stacked and organize the palleted freight needed to be worked for the day. Worked the freight, and straitened for a pleasing appearance. After, taking back waste and separating it into categories to be recycled. I binned and organized all extra freight in receiving and continued to help others finish up there tasks for the day."
good,"Typical day would be Sales, Customer Service, Cash Handling, Stocking, Order Placing."
good,"It's a good place to work, good management and co workers. Allows you to have a life outside of work. And also provides you with a 10% discount on general merchandise (:"
good,"Most days came with something different to offer. I learned a lot about cars and time management working there. The management was below fair due to the fact that they thought they knew everything. All my co- workers looked up to me because i would think of new ways to do things that would save time but still be in order for the task at hand. The hardest part of the job is working with no help due to management not scheduling enough people to work or people calling in. The most enjoyable part is when we would have a full crew and was ""knocking the work out"""
good,"Walmart Was Quite a job, they get vary busy specially on saturday and sunday. over all this place will give you enough hours of work."
good,a typcial day at work would be making the customers feel welcome and happy. i learned that time management is the key to a successful day at work. the management is all good but sometimes the managers in their offices tend to ignore some employee requests. my co-workers are friendly and helpful to me because i show them respect and i always keep a smile on my face. the hardest part of the job would be the schedule my manager gave me because it was always out of my availability time. besides that everything was joy for me especially the customers and the fast paced environment.
good,"Walmart was a challenge everyday that I walked through the doors. I loved the challenge.It helped me grow to be come a stronger person.I gained patience,became a problem solver,learned to be a quick thinker,and I became a friend and confidant to customers. The management inspired me to strive to become a member of the management team.My co-workers came from all walks of life. I learned alot of different culture and beliefs which humbled me as a person.The hardest part of my job was to not be able to do more for the employees.The best part of my job is knowing that I assisted in putting a smile on someones face and make their experience just a little bit better."
good,"good company to work for,but not long term job for.Management are well professional great staff,co workers everyone gets alone well always willing to help you even if your are a new hire, the only issue is the standing for long hours. but overall great company to work for,"
good,el ambiente de trabajo era divertido por que siempre entre los mismos compañeros nos poniamos metas para ver quien era el mejor aprendiamos muchas cosas por que siempre tratabamos de aprender cosas nuevas nuestra gerente era muy amable con todos siempre pendiente de lo k se nos dificultara como siempre habia dias donde teniamos mucha presion kreo esa era la parte mas deficil de nuestro trabajo aprendi en lo personal ablar mas fluible pero sobre todo perderle el miedo ablar ante mucho gente

good,great company to work for the pay is good the co workers are great teamwork is a plus and its a family type atmosphere
good,Bagged food management was good coworkers was nice hardest part never knowing what you would be working
good,A typical day would be just a regular cashiering job working with customers which I loved doing.They didnt teach me anything I used all the skills that I already had.The management was reallly nice I got along with everyone there.The co-workers there were fine maybe just a lil immature they were mostly high school student there really.The most enjoyable part of my day was dealing with my customers.
good,"first I would check my e-mail for any critical issues then I would check and order the on hands for all the departments, then divided all the paperwork from the genicom for the department managers and the store manager. Deliver these items, Did all the necessary daily paperwork. Finalized all the orders for the day. Captured all the missed markdowns or markups daily, And do any other assignment that I was given for the day."
good,work with customers
good,ce qui es le plus difficile chez walmart cest de gérer son temps
good,"Lo mejor es que adquirí muchos conocimiento administrativos, el ambiente con mis compañeros de trabajo era muy agradable, pero lo mas difícil era la rotación semanal de horarios."
good,"I worked the overnight shift and encountered a variety of customers during that shift. Daily tasks included money management, ringing up of customers orders, restocking the register areas, assisting in other areas when required. This increased my knowledge of the store layout and assisting customers with questions about inventory. After six months I advanced to an overnight CSM position. The hardest part of my position was adjusting to the overnight schedule."
good,Very flexible with work schedules.
good,"Walmart has strong core values that they instill upon every employee through rigorous training. The job title fits the description. However the wages are not very competitive for the area. An entry level position on an overnight schedule does not pay very well compared to other places. The hardest part of the job was the hours, but its the only shift that pays decent enough."
good,"Working a register, and operating a cash drawer, adjusting schedules for breaks and lunches, as well as returning merchandise and handling customer complaints."
good,I had to clean patient rooms. Responsible for the Cath Lad OR and waithing area and also the ICU. I worked alone and had great managers and a flexiable schedule. hardest part of the job was making sure the OR was ready to go cause the doctors could have a surgery at any mintue.Enjoyable part was making sure my area was clean and ready for inspection because i passed everytime.
good,"The values and culture are great, but as with any company a lot of it depends on who you report to. Co-workers are typically supportive, but there are also those that play politics, again true of anywhere."
good,"downstack truck, stock shelves and zone the store. keep store tidy and clean, plus assist customers which is the most fun of working. hardest part of the job is insuring everyone is doing their part to be successful. i stated earlier the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. some of our our managers are good nad some are not however we some how get the job done."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart is a busy workday and time flew.
good,"Sobre todo los dias lunes que hay mucha gente si entro en la mañana atiendo servivios al cliente y apoyo al area de cajas cobrando y cubria las comidas d los supervisores, aprendi la operacion de la tienda a tener un trato con los clientes saber como conducirme con ellos, la gerencia bien solo exigian que se tratara bien a los clientes y el voceo de los productos, lo mas dificil cuando por error se entregan los vinos y licores equivocados cuando los clientes estan molestos por el cobro de su mercancia, lo que me gusto del trabajo las oportunidades que dan para crecer la capacitacion en todos los sentidos y recursos que necesitaba."
good,"The majority of days are spent cleaning up & stocking shelves. You tend to have to answer a lot of customer questions & occassionaly look for something in the back. My co-workers tend to be fun & enjoyable people to hang around. Some are very humorous. I have learned many things about social interactions with people & how to deal with diverse personalities. There are many good managers, but as with all things there may be one or two that could have a better attitude. The hardest part is getting things done with limited resources. The most enjoyable thing is the friends you make along the way."
good,Best job I had as a young man. I loved my coworkers and work atmosphere.
good,"Wal-Mart was my first job and taught my about customer service, patience, and hard work. I was a cashier so a typical day was repetitive of the last. Co-workers seemed to come and go I did not work there very long before I found a job with PetSmart. The hardest part of the job was to find something to occupy my time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people every day."
good,"Liderava duas equipes a do refeitório e do restaurante,a prendi muito sobre gestão de pessoas, tinha pouco contato com o gerente, bom relacionamento com os colegas de trabalho, a parte mais difícil do trabalho era a falta de autonomia em relação a equipe e a mais agradável era o contato com o público."
good,"Pretty good as far as keeping busy and something new going on, layouts and display setups were fun, always meeting new people. Hours usually were flexible, except during holidays."
good,"Working for Walmart was agreat first job. Everyone was treated the same. The only negative thing I can say is that they want you to do too much and things that your superior should do. If I'm not get that salary, don't ask me to do it."
good,"learned new things, great co workers. Very demanding days, short staffed, back breaking work"
good,"Unloading incoming freight. Moving merchandise to sales floor utilizing hand pallet jacks, power jacks and walki-stacki. Stock merchandise to shelves and special displays, ensuring stock on shelves is rotated to place older product to front and newer product to back of displays. Providing information and assistance to customers. Adjusting back-room inventory as required using hand held scanner (telsar)"
good,"My day at work would consist of greeting customers, handling money, and operating a cash register. I learned how to deal with many different personalities of people and how to remain professional at all times. My co-workers, including management, were more family oriented than anything, but we all had to learn to look past each others differences when needed. There were really no hard times there, but I must say the most enjoyable times were when I was able to place a smile on someone else's face."
good,"I had fun here, altho the management didn't show themselves very often, so it did not seem like they cared. I met alot of differant folks there and had alot of fun."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work but it was just too many hours standing on my feet. As a cashier, working 8-9 hours every other day hurts my feet. The register was easy to learn and everyone was so nice."
good,Good work place and fun with co worker to work and good company for starter in canada.
good,"Great place to work, I enjoyed my time here I learned alot here. My supervisor was the best and I met a life long friend."
good,I was the Assistant Store manager. The store was in my hands majority of the time. The General Manager travels most of the time.

good,"My experience with walmart is about what you'd expect from a business of that magnitude. Low hours, low wage. But if your a people person, you might enjoy this job."
good,Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work if you are just looking for some extra cash but not a career for most people.
good,A job that i have gotten very use to. Flexible work hours and great team to work with. There is no hard part about my job you just have to learn to coop with everything and be successful at your job.
good,-I would start at 8:30am and work tell 2pm 2 days a week
good,"It may not be the best place for someones unable to handle stress well, because it would be hard to move up in position without being able to handle stress. However, it is a good place to work for job security in most cases and had decent pay and benefits for full time associates. Many times it is hard to attain full time position though."
good,"I loved working with the public, the only thing I would say is if you don't have the best attitude that job is not for you. Wal-Mart has great pay and benefits are excellent. They also have great bonuses when they give one."
good,I would stock shelves and help customers. I met a lot of new people. They managemnt team and my co-workers were very nice and easy to get along with. Keeping everything clean. Meeting new people
good,"I like working there. I like meeting different people and have small talk with them. My co-workers are fine. The managers are nice and do not really bother you. The hardest part of my job are some of the attitudes that the customers and the workers have, but once you get over that its not that bad."
good,"You work hard, you will recieve hard pay, they watch and see if you really a work worker, they customer will always be right at Wal-Mart. co-works are so nice and friendly to the customers."

good,"Typically my day started out as soon as I pulled into the parking lot. I would scan the conditions of the lot as well as see if the lot is properly staffed. Once I am on the clock I would immediately check the staffing for the day, checking for call outs, no shows or not enough staff. Then we would get togeher with the mgnt team to dicuss the days tour notes and and any issues we may see for the day. At that point I would get with my dept mgrs to share the notes and assign each accordingly as well as discuss any issues they may have or any needs they may have. That was one of my most enjoyable part of the day was to have this te to talk with them and help resolve any issues they may have. The hardest part of the day was ot feeling like there was enough time in the day to get what you want and need to get done and to make sure you have done everything possible to make your associates day go by without a hitch aswell as the vast aount of customer service that needed to be done. All in all it taught me how to work with a wide variety of different personalities and cultures. I have made lot of good friends from there and Walmart has always been very generous in working with any pesonnal issues I my of had. My time there has made me more of a well rounded person."
good,"A typical day at Walmart included, daily department manager duties. Counting stock, doing paper work, ordering stock, as well as constant communication with vendors. I learned alot about being in a managerial position, improved my ability to multi task, as well as follow strick deadlines. I enjoyed that it was a fast paced, challenging job."
good,"Some of the management were a little difficult to work with, and the customers difficult to deal with but i find that if you treat everyone the way you want to be treated you normally have very little problems. You don't really have set hours so you have to learn how to juggle home and work life."
good,"Comecei co repositor na mercearia, gostavam do meu comprometimento com o trabalho, e me indicaram como lider."

good,"a busy atmosphere with room for advancement. I have learned how to handle phone lines, counting money and management. Some of the co-workers are easy to get along with and others are a little more difficult but a wide range of people to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone, and learning how to just take one customer at a time."
good,"I worked the local Concert venues. I start my day by unloading all the semi Truck. Then set up props and lights, then Sound, and lights. Then sound check. Then wait for the Show.

I unload the Truck set up mortar tubes and put the Mortars in the Five different sizes and set the cakes up and get ready to shoot the show at 9:45.

good,"I was hired for assistance through out the holiday season, my leading role was to retrieve carts from the parking lot and take them back to the designated area for customers to acquire for easy mobility of products and packages. In addition to cart retrieval, I accommodated great customer service by assisting customers, disabled and non-disabled, by loading purchases to their vehicle."
good,Wal-mart is good at keeping you busy throught the work shift so that the time does speed by.
good,Working for a large company has its advantages and disadvantages but mostly as long as you do your job here you will advance and earn experience that is very helpful for the future whether it is for this company or another.

good,"Uma cultura bem forte na empresa , mas com horarios muito diversos q acabava atrapalhando a vida pessoal"
good,Love working with co-workers. Management is unfair at points and makes many misjudgements.
good,A great place to work. The environment is fun but professional. They have very strict policies that need to be adhered to and writeups are common because of the strcit policies.
good,"Most of the customers were friendly and never rushed which made the day go by fast. I learned that being patient with ""mean"" people is better than yelling at them because you have no idea what might have happened to them recently or longterm. The management wasn't the greatest but I still managed my way through the day. All the co-workers were friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was getting time off. ( They didnt give me my prom or highschool graduation day off so i missed both of them). The most enjoyable part was when people who just wanted to go home and didnt make conversation, i loved it."
good,Working on a register with customer interaction through out your shift is very enjoyable and it does keep your work life eventful.

good,Friendly workers
good,I enjoy working for Wal-Mart because it is a great job. The work is not hard and it is easy to interact with other people during their shopping experiences.
good,"As a cashier, every work day is basically the same. The same interaction with customers and co-workers during the checkout experience are dealt with every day. Working this job has given me good experience in retail and also working with the public. One of the more difficult items is the length of a shift considering we stand on our feet the entire time. Also sometimes we are asked to work over only to be asked to take that time off later in the week therefore receiving no compensation for the extra time we gave the company."
good,i learend that customer service is the most important.i learned team work is the best way to get things done.
good,A good stable job job with room for within the company but management staff hurts company succeed.

good,working with walmart is a good thing when you are single and no kids but its had when you have a family but they will work it out with you and take care of there co workers
good,"The Company has good benefits, excellent employee discounts. Values are of the utmost because the company is servicing the community. Jobs security could be improved along with advancement opportunities. Management is doing the best with what they are assigned. The work and life balance need much improvement because employee hours are constantly lowered to the point of hardship. At Walmart part time employees should be able accumulate hours worked for full benefits."
good,"help customer with returns and exchanges of wal-mart products. also help as a casgier when needed, did some training in the cash office."
good,"Worked with many supportive co-workers devoted to their position, however hours and some management disconnect with other staff and customers. Communication, Ive learned, is key and if it weren't for my co-workers, many hard times would have been harder. Good benefits and training for IMS supervisor position. Great experience on sales floor as well with firearms, sporting goods, ammo, etc."
good,Unload the truck or trucks that are on the schedule. Separate the product as it comes off the truck. After put up all freight in the main department that are the unloader respondsibility.
good,A typical day included Unloading and sorting merchandise. Stocking shelves while providing customer service. I would also assist with the cash register when needed.
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me is making sure that your productivity stays in top shape. This includes stocking shelves in a allotted amount of time, zoning and cleaning up the store before our facility opens to customers."
good,Great place to work. Good Culture and environment. I have learned a lot.
good,Good part-time job but definitely not a full time job for me.
good,"uma empresa boa de se trabalhar,uma empresa que oferece varios trinamento.aprendi assar pao, fatiar frios,segurança alimentar, bom relacionamento com colegas, trabalhar em conjunto, gerencia bao mas tem muito que aprender."
good,"A typical day at work always started with a meeting to let everyone know what was going on with the company and to catch up the associates on current events especially those who may have been off for the previous day. I learned a lot about how to manage inventory and sales as well as working reports and day to day operations of retail. I enjoyed working with the customers and I like working in a positive work environment with customers and other associates. The hard part of the meetings is the tendency to always focus on what people do wrong (negative) and not on what people do correctly. (positive) It creates a hostile work environment, which makes for poor morale among the associates."
good,"at the beginning of the shift, you are assigned a department and a goal for the amount of stock that is expected to be worked in a 8 hr shift."
good,Unloading trucks with a variety of products. I learned to operate different lifts fork and clamp. Great management able to learn different positions. Team players everyone worked together. Unloading import trucks due to production that was expected. Working with my co workers.
good,Its a very hectic work place. Management often expects 110% when there isn't enough coverage in a department. Sales associate get pulled to the front to get on a register and help with the LONG lines. It is a stable job but I don't get holidays off. For the past two years my holidays have been spent at work. It is a job and if you take advantage you can move up to management as long as you know the right people.
good,"no wal mart aprendi trabalhar em equipe , adiqueri a experiencias de conferente em carteira e fiz treinamento em conferencia em recebimento e expedição."
good,"12 hours shift,i learned the basics for nursing,the hardest part of the job was probably working 12 hours and then holidays.The pay was great at my age."
good,"I enjoyed my time at WM, and occasionally miss it. Great people to work with in all age groups."
good,"If you love to meet new people and make friends, than this is the job for you. I had a great time working with my coworkers and some cutomer service managers. However, the job can be very demanding, especially on your physical body. Be sure to expect aches and pains especially in the soles of your feet and your lower back in case you are not already used to it. A good way secure your job is to always be available. Although that is not always possible as some people actually want to live a portion of their lives outside of those walls. And if you don't mind having an angry customer yell at you as if you stole their baby, then you should try it out. As they would tell you, the customer is not mad at you, they are just mad. Through it all, the job can be very rewarding if you are a grounded person who loves to make people smile. Gotta love it. You will never have a boring day."
good,Nice place to work especially if you enjoy co-workers and or customers
good,this was a good place to work I learned so much direct management was good upper management was not so good after the changes they made.My co workers were wonderful made lasting friendships hardest part of the job was working on fixing tires most enjoyable was working freight
good,Pros: Employee discount and benefits.
good,My Typical day at work would be to stock shelves to make sure the merchandise is out so that the customers will have access to the things that they need. After that is done I would do a great walk through of the department and make sure there is a perfect zone. And to insure that all of the shelve facings are full.
good,very fast paced job. management was always on point ready to listen.very friendly and hard working co workers.having to move from one department to the other was somewhat hard and fun at the same time because it gives you the knowledge of where everything is and enables you to help customers easily with anything they need.
good,"Loved the hours, loved the pay, was most impressed with the involvement of community activities."
good,We would wear our headsets and fill the orders that come through. After we stacked the order we would take it to wrapping. Then we would go onto another order.
good,"I often got up early and made sure I was presentable for work, Signed into my post. When I quit I left a proper two week notice in writing. I kept a neat work area, it prevents things from being lost. I got along with my coworkers. Hardest part was being called into the Manager's office once. Humiliation.Hardest part was stocking clothes. I loved managing a cash register and talking to people"
good,Assisting customers with questions and running register.
good,District Personnel Manager/Assistant.
good,"A typical work day, I went in and sat up my shift made sure 1st shift was done an out of the way. I had my start up meeting with my associates and informed them on what we had to do for the day. I learned how to deal with a large group of people and what to deal with coming after another shift. The most enjoyable part was the people, being able to communicate with your assoicates every day"
good,A typical day at work can go either way. I learned to get well rested for a warehousing job. Their management sucks. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was unloading GM trucks while your crew is short handed. Most enjoyable part was pulling pallets to the sales floor.
good,"I would go to work at 10.00 pm unload the truck(s) and then stock the shelves, while giving good customer service whe required.Most of the job was solitary and i am a people person."
good,"My day started at 6:00 AM (on the weekends) or 7:00 AM (on the weekdays), where I would stand outside and sign in the various vehicles lined up for automotive services (oil changes, tire changes, battery charging, etc.) I learned of the differences in oil filters for various vehicles and how to attach windshield wipers. The management was very professional and easy to talk to. My coworkers were very professional as well."
good,"I love providing customer service. I loved working at walmart in the bakery, deli and as a cashier. It was great to use my creativity and to interact with customers."
good,"Very satisfied to be hired on, could have felt more welcome compared to everyone else. The experience feels very independant. The overall store, merchandise, items, and everything included is very excellent, and very superb. The potential to work for Walmart is great. There may need more balancing to even things out and the health needs to be uplifted and improved. Very great, accomodating and nice place, may not be a better choice. VERY FUN!! That is a place that will be missed."
good,"Every work environment has issues, but at Walmart if there is an issue it can be corrected. There is room for advancement and overall it is very pleasant and satisfactory. The hardest thing would be having to deal with unhappy customers, but the majority of the customers I have come in contact with it was like talking to a neighbor and all the employees are like family."
good,You learn the most from long term associates. You become family with most of your co-workers. If you have a good management team that supports you anything is possible. The hardest part of the job was all the meetings that take place.
good,"I loved the fact that I worked 1st shift. On that shift you saw mothers, grandmothers and people from elderly homes shopping. I really enjoyed checking out those customers, as they were the most respectful group."
good,"We start with getting merchandise from the back room and then we go ahead with stocking. We help customers with various things . Guide them to the desired locations and help them in choosing right product for their needs. Management should be professional bit unfortunately there is no such criteria in Retail industry. Co-workers are helping in nature and they are the one who share their experiences and enhanced our knowledge..The most enjoying part of job, no doubt, is customer service."
good,"followed up on daily tasks, e-mails, communicated directives and maintained bakery area to maximize profit and sales"
good,"A typical day a walmart is pretty basic you clock in you then go to work station and review your job duties for the day. I leaned how to deal and communicate with customers to get customer service experience face to face with customers as well as on the phone. I learned how to answer and solve customer questions and complaints to the best of my knowledge and what my title and job duties allowed me to do. Management was great at walmart they were willing to go the extra mile to help and show you new things to help you move up in the business as well as giving you tips to help you get your job done fast but efficient. As well as teaching new strategies and procedures for your own personal knowledge. My co Workers were great to everyone was friendly and always helped where it was needed or if asked. We taught each other different ways of doing procedures or task to help each other when we found new and improved ways of doing things. We always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the hours you would work 6 days a week sometimes but only work for four hours at a time. i don't feel that its worth it i rather it be worth my wild to come in and worth the gas money now a days and work 3 days a week working an 8 hour shift or double then to work 6 days a week for only 4 hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and coworkers, there was always work to be done and you were never standing around with nothing to do."
good,"Pretty fun and Management was cool, co workers was great people to be around."
good,nice place to work people are very sweet easy to work with.. the management was were pretty ok people.. the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers
good,Bad employees always late messy work never get the job done etc...
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has been a great learning experience. It has helped me become very patient and skilled in working with the general public and people from several different backgrounds. Most managers are people who were promoted from entry-level positions so they are very understanding. The people I worked with are so knowledgeable and diverse that you can't help but learn from every interaction. The hardest part of the job is the high turnover but with that also comes the most enjoyable part, meeting new associates every month."
good,"pay could be higher, and hours more on a fixed schedule. work days and timeswere always changing"
good,Walmart employees work long hours. have excellent training programs. Bonus plan for executives is outstanding.
good,"A typical day at work for me is pretty much predictable I worked in the pharmacy, so its a predicable day, although I do get to work in different work stations throught the day, I learned so much about different types of medicines. As far as management goes the management are very nice and helpful, most times when you need them, I think that its very important for management staff to be helpful and understanding, to me it makes employees like me appreciate them more. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was insurance claims, which was something that I liked to do because I love a challange, but sometimes insurance companies are not as good as customers think they are untill they wont cover their medication that someone may really need, and they get fustrated and sometimes will take it out on me, but I try to be understanding. On the bright side the more enjoyable part of my job was using the computer because I love computer and technology, and using the phone. Ever since I was younger I love technology and was always good putting stuff together, and the other enjoyable thing for me was working with my co-workers, I had worked with them for 3-4 years and they bacame close to me."
good,thie people are happy most of the time management and co- workers were fun to work with
good,"Tasks I performed as Department manager; cashier, price changing, customer relations, interviewing, inventory control, hunting and fishing licenses, resetting shelves for new modular for different areas."
good,Individual stores are different based on the store manager. Great 401k and profit sharing program. Health care could use some improvement but everyone's is expensive nowadays.
good,"sorting new skids of stock, pulling skids to the sales floor, taking unneeded stock to the backroom to be binned for later use, building full skids of bulk stock to be put up on the steel, receiving trucks of perishable food, helping to unload trucks, cleaning the backroom. At end of night pull all empty and unworked skids off the floor to prepare the store for customers."
good,Over all excellent company to work for. Good people managers very friendly.
good,"Average day would include a clocking in, go to staff meeting, go punch in your job, do your job, punch out, clock out. Go home."
good,"My experience was good here. I worked there for a long time during college,. The bonus every year was wonderful, especially because even part-time employees recieved it. Some managers are on a power trip, but not all. I would definetly tell a friend to work there."
good,Busy workplace with a lot of nice people to work with. I have acquired many new management tools for retail/fresh food areas.
good,"Estabilidad laboral,capacitacion permanente,beneficios exclusivos."
good,"This was my first full time job out of high school I learned how important it is to earn respect from co-workers and management. I was the pet department sales associate I stocked the shelves, provided customer service to customers, and was a cashier when needed."
good,Wal Mart is a great place to work. I learned a lot from working there. Mainly I learned a lot about cars and how to change oil. The managers were there when I had a problem with a customer or an issue with another associate. I liked dealing with customers on a one on one basis. I built relationships with my co-workers and management. I enjoyed learning as much as I learned working there.
good,"A typical work day can vary greatly depending on the shift scheduled for the day, whether it be an opening shift, mid-shift, or closing shift. Every shift is based on a generalized routine that is to be followed, but working with the general public there is always the element of surprise. This aspect of the job has helped me learn to think quick on my feet to solve problems and resolve conflicts. Management does their best but can not be everywhere at once. Co-workers keep everything running smoothly, we are all there together to work as a team and accomplish the tasks given to us. We are only as strong as the weakest member of our team, so we help each other out when needed and learn from missteps when they occur. The hardest part about the job is the continual upkeep of the facilities equipment and computer systems to properly take care of customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of a job well done, having the customer be happy with the product and the customer service provided."
good,A typical day at work is a fast paced environment where customer service and work ethic values are steadfast and will keep employees challenged and on one's feet. There are two 15 minute breaks and a lunch hour for full time employees and management is reasonable.
good,not a bad place to work but u will only ever be part time like working over night
good,"During the day, there's a lot of products to be stocked or relocated. When I work in the evenings, I mostly organize and maintain the department. However, during both times of the day serving our customers is the top priority. I've learned how to communicate better and to be versatile. Management tries their best to be involved with the associates, but mostly gives tasks with high expectations (tasks that must be done ASAP). The hardest part of the job is having to multitask when there isn't enough time to really finish everything at once, especially when managers expect tasks to be completed quickly by just one or two associates. Overall, the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new skills or abilities and being able to talk comfortably to fellow associates or management about anything."
good,The work wasn't appealing but the people and management style made it worth it.
good,"I am a deli sales associate at Wal-Mart. Customers are a huge part of any work day. This could include helping them find itmes that he or she may be looking for in the store to cooking and taking orders. There are many task to do and all are important for the job to be completed properly. I enjoy working with this company, but I am looking for career advancement for my children. The management in the store are nice family people and so are the co-workers. I try to enjoy all of the job because it must be done whether we like it or not. Although the people are great it is not a full-time position and it is not the pay that can help me advance in a way needed to support my children."
good,my coworkers were great we were a great team. it is retail but the management works hard to help out giving you days off you need to be with family.
good,"I usually work about 8 hours a day. Iv'e learned there are people who are on the worst end than you are. Management is not just a requirement from a piece of paper. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot pretty much all day, the most enjoyable is seeing people smile."
good,"I learned a lot about jewerly. Learned about gold and silver, different cuts in dimonds, and how to fix watches....remove and add links, replaced battieries, open and closed reg. cleaned up before leaving for the night."
good,"A typical day included pulling, and stocking inventory as well as provide excellent customer service to the public. I learned how to organize and set up modulars for product sales on the store front sales floor. My co-workers were informative as well as diverse. The hardest part of this job was constant squatting, bending, and pulling of heavy products and the most enjoyable part of this job were the work hours"
good,"Clocked in and saw my supervisor for directions to what checkstand to work at and relieve cashiers foir breaks. Took breaks at appointed time, followed directions by my supervisor and clocked out at end of day. Great relationship with co-workers. It was an easy environment to work in."
good,I've learned that the best way to keep a business together is keeping customer service at its peek and always remain strong in your word.
good,Nice job. A lot of hours. Fast pace and that makes the day go by fast.
good,I worked there for 20 years and had a good job for that long know im looking for something new
good,*customer service for 8 hours
good,"The pay is low, but there is decent management and they care about individuals. As long as you work hard, the job is not that bad."
good,I loved this job. I only left because I couldnt close the deli. And I needed more hours
good,"My day would start with helping the stockers get there merchandise together to stock. Afterwards, the maintenance team would have the daily meeting and assign duties. Working at Walmart I learned how to work as because of the large amount of we had to accomplish before the shift was over. I was lucky to have good co-workers."
good,It didn't take me long to go from a part time toy zoner to department mananger. I learned there was a lot more to domestics then just folding curtains and towels. That area took my patience to a whole new level going into it after the person who left realizing she didn't take the time to really care. My most enjoyable part of the job was coming up with solutions to fix problems that were going on. I enjoyed everyone i worked with.
good,"Easy going, worked well with others, attended customers as much as possible, accomplished my work. Learned to be a better people person, to try to fullfill each of their duties, hardest was workin o/n xmas stockin for toys but was always accomplished, and was the most enjoyable to try to supply to all the parents for what they were lookin for."
good,i really enjoyed this job other than the drama that came with other receiving associates. i loved the sales floor jobs. and if u try hard there rlots ofoportunities for advancement. id actually love to work for this company again.
good,Great opportunity for advancement. sacrafice of work life balance
good,"a typical work day would be very busy, but the loyal customers with great attitudes always made time fly."
good,i loved my job at wal-mart. i just needed to be home with daughter thru her school years. she has always been my priority. i learned a lot about accounting and and was gave a lot of new opportunities. the hardest part of working at wal-mart was juggling time for my family. now my daughter is grown up on me. i am ready to hit the workforce again.
good,"*Entrada a la tienda a las 6 am salida del trabajo entre 5 y 6 pm. Dos horas de tiempo de comida en el cual generalmente comía en la tienda. Revisaba las áreas de la tienda a mi cargo que estuviera de acuerdo a estándares de operación. Aprendí a trabajar con grupos de trabajo de mas de 50 personas, a trabajar bajo presión y a trabajar en base a resultados. La Dirección/Gerencia de la cual yo formaba parte era conformada por gente joven con mucho dinamismo en donde era necesario tener un buen liderazgo. La parte mas difícil era el evitar la rotación y hacer que la tienda vendiera mas cuando el entorno no era satisfactorio. Lo que mas me gustó es que podia utilizar mi creatividad para hacer cosas a pesar que Walmart esta lleno de estándares y procedimientos."
good,"Every day I come to work I find out the daily tasks and discuss that with my team. I constantly check on my peers to make sure they dont need any help. I dispatch truck drivers and keep track of millions of dollars of assets such as trailers and tractors. I have learned how to manage conflict, how to be an effective team player, my communication and presentation skills have gotten sharper. The hardest part of my job is not having the authority or being in a position to make big decisions. I am a great decision maker and I want to be the one my team depends on to make that very important decision. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people. We have a built a relationship and that has caused us to be a stronger team."
good,- Typical day at work start with a good stretch and and update on sales. People in places so all notes that must be completed are done so in a proper manner.
good,"I love working withe the people and meeting new people! The Managers are great even the store manager! The pay isnt enough though.Ive been there for almost a year,it will be a year in august and im just now getting full time."
good,"i would walk in a clock in and get to work, very freindly people there that love to socialise with me."
good,"It is pretty slow in the morning, but as the day goes by the customers keep coming in. Ive learned to be very patient, understanding. Management is good, you can always go to them, the co-workers are fun and make the day go by fast. The hardest part about this job was trying to remember where everything was because things get moved around daily. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers, and listening to what they had to say that day."
good,I work 3rd shift in Louisville when I worked at Wal-Mart and I loved it. My co-workers were fantastic and I loved the work!
good,"I really loved working for Walmart. I enjoyed helping customers and meeting different people. Management is pretty fair, it's almost like family and they are understanding when it comes to problems. Family comes first with Walmart."
good,"Wal mart is a good place to work, but i think its call about where your store is located,and also who runs your Dep. ( YOUR MANAGEMENT). if thats all in order and your grass roots are good, then in my eyes you should never look to quite or go anywhere. I'm the type of person that loves to work, i love helping others, and hey!!! i love my own money. In the area at the wal-mart i worked, Sales where slow and just after 3 years for working there- a team of 20 plus workers got laid off. Sad but, I did the hole unemployment thing for a while and i hate it, now its time for me to get back in the swing of things. I'am looking to movie up with a growing company."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, checking in returns and checking receipts upon exit. Management was always visible and very friendly. Co-workers were very helpful and friendly. There really was not a hard part of this job. The most enjoyable aspect was dealing with the customers."
good,Ok place to work doesn't pay to much unless your an assistant manager. Favoritism runs very high so that sucks but the job is easy can't really complain
good,"It is challenging and I get to work with people so I really like it. I really like my co-workers, most are close friends. The hardest part of my job is when I cant help a customer and they yell and scream at me. The best part of my job is the relaxing atmosphere because I don't have a supervisor hanging around."
good,"co workers are cool,the management could be a little better, the job really isn't hard, i've learned a better sense of responsibility, a typical work day consist of moderate work"
good,i enjoyed worked there. good people. clean stores.a lot of parking
good,Wal-Mart actually sticks by their values......It's a job that's pretty much all about customer service. The only thing that was unfair to me is that I worked for them for 4 years and was getting closing shift when they would bring in new people and have them on the day shift. They did state that scheduling is not based on seniority but it should be. It's only right. I also was not happy with when I transferred between different store locations as I lost my pay. So after 4 years of working with Wal-Mart I was only making $8.00 an hour.
good,"The work environment is an enjoyable one since I am a ""people person"". I work the morning shift, so a typical day at work for me may be slower than others since most customer are either sleep, at work, or school. I have learned a greater deal of patience since I do cater and assist a lot of elderly customers. The management is very helpful, fair, professional. The most enjoyable part of my job is impacting others lives' positively and knowing everyday that I clock out I have helped at least one person."
good,every thing was fun about retail great learn experince
good,We began with a 10 min start up meeting where we went over our numbers and safety information.
good,Very rewarding position where I was able to help customers find products based on their needs. I still have customers asking about products even after I haven't worked there for 5 years.
good,"I was a layaway associate that worked hard and got recognition for it. I liked the management and staff there. I also liked the employee discount. The hardest part of working there was the hours, I did not have a set schedule and the hours would change 2-3 times after they were posted. It was very hard to make plans that way."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Wal-Mart but the night shift schedule was really demanding.
good,"A typical day at work was to receive several pallets of merchandise and place them where they belong. I learned how to stack a pallet. Management was just okay for me. The co-workers, some of them were awesome and some were not. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish large amounts of pallets before the shift was over. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how Walmart worked."
good,"Walk through the store and backroom, identify any opportunities and assign staff to eliminate them. Review reports for sales and inventory. Accounting paperwork and deposit entry. Address any associate concerns, assist customers, take temps for the fresh areas to ensure quality products. Utilize routines to assist with operations and customer service. Attend and hold meeting to cascade information for store directions. Tour areas in detail and work on any merchandising to maximize sales and instock. Assist with HR services(hiring, time adjustments, schduling and timeoff requests) Address any performance and attendance issues. Educate and train associates on enhancement of daily tasks. Prepare the backroom for truck unloading and ensuring all trucks are unloaded and added to store inventory system. Run reports for price changes and modulars to assign and plan to execute. From 11-4 IMS (Inventory Management System) has items in the system that need to be addressed so that the products can be ordered or stocked to improve instock. Assist in service areas as needed and ensure the security of those areas at closing times. Maintain operations, compliance logs and controls throughout the day."
good,"very understanding company, I unload pallets of goods about 8 is the norm,my co-workers are always willing to help out, as I am too. management is understanding and the hardest part is when we get in a large truck and we have short amount of people to work those trucks..but by most this is a good job"
good,"Being a Customer Service Manager at Wal-Mart is an enjoyable job to have. At times it can be stressful, but overall the job is rewarding. Being a Customer Service Manager is a great stepping stone for jobs later on. The amount of information that can be learned is virtually endless, and I enjoy working as a team with my fellow co-workers. Sometimes there is not enough staffing, and so planning breaks and lunches can be challenging. Everything that Wal-Mart has to offer can be beneficial to others. These offerings can help individuals to develop their skills and to find jobs that look for particular experiences. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make a difference in the customer's life and to go above and beyond what they expect."
good,A good and interactive work experience were everyone is treated as a team
good,I enjoyed meeting and working with a variety of people. Working in the electronics department I learned about new technoolgy.
good,When I worked at Walmart my coworkers we like my family. And they like to promote from within. If you work hard the opportunities to advance will be presented. When I shop their now a year later my old coworkers still know be name and will hug me. Pay is horrible though.
good,"Most days working at WalMart were predicatable for the most part. I learned how to maintain a a sales floor of larger capacity, handle customers in a bigger venue, and many other skills that help me not just with work, but in life as well. With this job I definitely had to learn how to use the patience I already knew and I gained more patience. Management was typical as with every other job, such as, there was ups and downs to each manager, but overall they were a good team of managers. As for my co-workers, it is the same as the managers, but we all got the job done together. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were not going to be satisfied regardless of what you did or said. I enjoyed coming to work everyday, however, because helping people is a passion of mine that I will happily do."
good,"I was a hard worker at walmart.Hardly ever call out,did my work,But one problem I had at walmart was some of the associates wanted me to help them with there work,but they did not want to help me.I complain to the supervisor,but did not do anything.they always talk about team work.but that was not."
good,"I was cashier a person to stock shelves and make sure that my area was nice and clean. helped customers find what they were looking for. Basically any assistance with the customers. management wasn't very pleasant which made work unpleasant, but I learned how to interact with the public and really enjoyed working with my co-workers!"
good,Loved the people I worked with. Alot is expected of you. Alot of walking.
good,"Nice to work for, enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,"Most managers are a ok, the pay is not where it needs to be for the amount of work you have to put in. co workers are sneaky and evil so tp speak if they dont like you its going to be known. not a good long term job"
good,not a tough job. fairly simple and hours were reasonable.
good,Was a cashier then an electronic sales associate and finaly Department Manager.
good,"I work in the Deli section of Wal-Mart. I find that my co-workers are easy to get along with and will help me with any questions that I have. I work in the evening so most of my job is finishing cooking for the day and cleaning up. I have learned how to judge what food items need to be cooked for the evening and how much based on how busy the deli is. One of the hardest parts of the job is balancing the cooking and cleaning between greeting the customers, answering their questions, and taking their orders. Once the customers and most of the cleaning have been taken care of, it's nice to be able to talk with my co-workers and get to know who they are."
good,"clocked in,hung my coat up,unload the trucks,break down freight,transport to l carts or rocket carts,stock shelves,and pick up trash as you go. I learned how to sell tobacco, learned manual and electric jacks,learned how to stock and face items.Learned how to be in a team and have teamwork.The hardest part of the job was manually pullin the trucks and stacking the skids at the end of the shift.The most enjoyable prt was helping customers find what needed.My co-workers were very funloving people and they worked just as hard a i which made it easy to promote team work."
good,"My day consisted of a list of projects my assistant manager wanted done that day. a list from my merchindise manager wanted done and a list from my department manager. Would prioritize projects into most urgent to least. Then would set up cash drawer in department, scan all out items and order if needed. Stock merchandise, recieve merchandise from Fed-ex and UPS. Send out items that needed repair or sized. once, that was all done I would start my lists of projects. The whole time also waiting on customers. Selling stock and replacing watch batteries, bands and taking special orders for class rings and jewelry."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart Distribution Center begins with a start-up meeting where we are inform of a safety topic and the volume for the day. Orderfillers are responsible for selecting cases for store orders. Depending on the volume determines how many hours you get that day. I've learned how to drive a RSR Lift and a center rider. I've also learn how to stack cases properly to be shipped to the stores undamaged. I've learn how to work well with my co-workers on a respectful and fun level. The management team is a pleasure to work for. My co-workers are fun, hardworking, and safe at what they do. The hardest thing about my job is dealing with lazy ppl., The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing at the end of the day I did my best to service the customer productively and safely."
good,"working for this company in the beginning was exciting. you learned something new everyday, but working in retail there is never a dull moment. sometimes it can be demanding and overwhelming, but that did not bother me i love to multitask. The management team there is somewhat helpful. Of course there are those that take the time to know their associates and others could care less. My co-workers were great to work with, u learn the meaning of teamworkEspecially when u are left to run two or more departments on your own, which was the hardest part of the job.I learned to hae much patience and understanding."
good,Wal-mart is an ok place to work for. I would assist customers with their transactions and help them locate items. I learned that cashiering involves dealing with all kinds of people and their preferences for bagging.
good,"I love what I do at work. My biggest complaint is my pay, I barely make enough to provide for myself and my son."
good,"A day at work here can be fun, and enjoyable but also very stressful and draining. Expertise in customer service is necessary for this job, when dealing with people. The management are not very aware of the employees under them and issues. They do not provide efficient compensation for issues and problems among the employees. Co-workers are friendly and approachable, but gossip is a big problem among the associates.The hardest part of my job is the hostile customers that I have to accomodate and help. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and the conversing with customers."
good,no incentive I also had a workman comp claim which they refuse and they refuse to listen to my doctor this store believe in pet not hard workers it really depend on the manager. I got recognize for my good selling
good,Leading dynamic service oriented teams; I
good,Very laid back. Taught me great customer service skills. Co-workers are awesome.
good,On a regular days of work i would have to unload both merchandise and grocery truck.It was hard but i learned how to use different machinery and computer programs that made me a step ahead while working.My co-workers were like a family with how we help each other out with teamwork.The hardest parts of the job i would say was throwing the trucks back to back and also packing and making a bail.The most enjoyable part of the job was the easier portion where we would go to the floor and stock merchandise.Its the most enjoyable because it was easaly able to find where i would have to put the merchandise quick and easy
good,"A typical day at work at the Bristol walmart was setting up your register, cashing out customers, and helping take care of overstock on the downtime. It was generally a fun place to work. I learned to work fast, without sacrificing quality of work and working with many people at once."
good,"worked the night shift. I learned to pick up speed on the job and matching upc codes. I really enjoyed staying busy, busy, busy."
good,"Finding the challenge that will make life easier and more worth while.Tired of the normal check to check.Ready to separate the ""men from the boys""."
good,This job is by no means extraordinarily difficult. It is a guaranteed paycheck and it is safe. Training is provided for the position and you are typically working alongside plenty of people willing to assist you.
good,came start stocking store items
good,"A typical day at work as a department manager would be completing price changes, modulars, and customer service. I learned how to set modulars quickly and effectively. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer find an item they are looking for and knowing they were satisfied. The hardest part of my job is when management would require many tasks to be completed and knowing which ones needed to be completed right away and which could wait, I have to pioritize each day and ensure the most important tasks are completed."
good,The little time I was there I enjoyed working for this company.
good,was expected to do the remodel of walmart.Alot of destruction alot of building
good,"Place is a bit soul sucking, very understanding manages, but very poor communication between manages and employees. Generally disorganized and willing to overlook some company policies, but not others. Lots of favoritism."
good,"Behind the registers most of the day and other times I work at customer service, and push carts outside"
good,"My typical day when I worked at nights was to go have a meeting, then gather my team which consisted of at least 20 - 25 people depending on the night. Depending on whether it was a holiday or not , or if the store had been ran sacked because of a hurricane dictated the outcome. I would pull all the pallets out from the grocery side for each aisle usually would have somebody help me. Then would drop all the merchandise on the floor where it goes including all of the gm freight that came into the grocery side. Depending on the aisle on how it looked would usually determine how much backstock I would pull out. If the aisle wasn't so bad and the amount of grocery that came in for that night maybe just try to find all the lows and outs. After I got my team set with that I would go around and look at all the displays, front main displays, side displays and skids for each aisle and determine whether I would have to tear them down and rotate them to smaller displays or fill them up. At 3 in the morning I usually would receive a dairy, frozen, or charts (sales items for the week) truck and would unload it. At around 4:30 we would have to pick up shrink wrap all pallets going back and get them lifted into the racks so the backroom would look good. After all that we would zone the isles which is bringing everything foward."
good,There was a major lack of training provided for aspects of jobs for this company.
good,"A typical day at work consist of working in your department, helping customers ans maybe others in their departments. I learned alot from Walmart. My co-workers was nice and I enjoyed working with them. My hardest part was trying to get there. The most enjoyable part was working I loved Walmart."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. It's a family atmosphere and they will acknowledge your accomplishments. However, as a pharmacy technician, there is not much more room to advance in this company."
good,As an employee of Wal Mart I was trained to do my job. Sometimes the tools that was needed was lacking. I have taken all that I learned from Wal Mart and apply them to life situation as theu arise.
good,"Everyday was different when I worked on the sales floor. The store associates, Zms, Mgrs knew my capabilities from the previous years of being an unloader/ics team, and cashier. Management would come directly to me to get certain tasks and hard jobs done by end of the day/week. I was trusted to get the hard demanding jobs done comparing to my other co-workers based on expierence and work ethic. Co-workers were all different when it came to hard work/fast paste environments. Most enjoyable time i had working with walmart was the seasonal asile modulars. It was different, and fun setting up modulars and working alone to get them done. I enjoyed being put aside to do other projects because there was no distractions."
good,"We usually were constantly busy during our shift. Loved to learn departments when I could, and went to the stationary department from being a cashier. I worked hard, and learned quite a bit from that department."
good,"It was usually busy all day every day. Some managers were very helpful and great people, while other managers were very rude. I liked my co-workers I made good friends from working there. Hardest part was trying to get a day off. The most enjoyable part was working in a face paced environment all the time."
good,High volume grocery building that requires extreme time committment to working.
good,"Walmart is a cool place to work for. They treat you well, if you have the drive to do what they expect of you."
good,I worked in the electronics department assisting customers with information and operation of electronics and computers. i learned that the customer sometimes has to be educated about new technology. management was eager to teach and help you grow unless you got a whole new management team. My coworkers were sometimes stingy with customers thinking you would steal a sale. the hardest part was having two overbearing team leads and knowing more than both of them about electronics. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and associates learn new ways to accomplish tasks involving electronics.
good,"Good job, work was consistent, worked the laste hours, nice people there"
good,Walmart is a good place to work. I like the prices and the atmosphere that the workers and the customers bring.
good,worked there for three years like options of moving to other deparments mostly friendly atmosphere. had good days and bad days.
good,"Walmart isnt a bad place to work, I like that they work with you schedule when you school or other situations. The HR lady is very sweet and will try to what she can for you when your in a bad situation. However some of the managment team, isnt so nice. I dont like the way they treat their employees or how they handle a probelm. Although a lot of the management team will help and handle probelms in friendly manner."
good,"Learned about merchandising, managing 100 plus people at different levels with different skills and abilities."
good,Overall WAL-MART was a unique experience and very little people get the oppurtunity to work in such an environment. I had to learn from watching other works and job shadow to get the job done
good,overall it was a nice place to work for the most part the people were nice the pay ok and the work nice but it could be crazy at times and there was just too many managers and they never coordinated so one would give you instructions then two minutes later another would give you completely different orders then you would get in trouble for not doing the first thing but mostly the other employees who were not managers were nice people and very friendly.
good,"I wish I could have had time off earlier, in other words, I wish I could have had the benefits without waiting 3~6 months."
good,This was a good part time job & I did go full time. But the hours I worked were hard. The job itself was easy.
good,I am a hard worker looking to expand my career. I am not just looking for a job but career as well. A place where i can raise to the top of the company an in this company i was begin turn down.
good,"Bad Management! However the associates made due with what we had. I often travel from store to store to help. It made me appreciate working in the store that I was based, but found out that the pay was not the same for the job. So not fair."
good,"I loved working here, the hours were not very flexible but the people were nice and the environment was busy busy busy, which I loved."
good,"Help put out freight, help customers locate items that they are looking for, zone areas (infants/baby, boys, girls, woman and men) departments. I also help out in the jewerly department, shoe department and help check out customers"
good,"Not a bad place to work, but there is not alot of room for advancements as MOST employees are only part time. Part time does not collect on benefits like full time either."
good,"Every day low prices that encourage more shoppers to come in. Also, a one-stop-shop."
good,Walmart really focuses on providing the customers with the best deals in order to save them money. They really believe in not being undersold by a competitor. Its a company that is growing more and more everyday and they really bring jobs to areas that need them. The management really pushes you to do your best and suceed within the company. They are really good about promoting within the company and depending on how well you do..you will be able to advance very quickly.
good,The company is not horrible to work for. The work isn't hard at all and some of the people you meet working here are pretty nice. The management can be a pain simply because they dn't see what goes on on an hourly basis and they can create their own judgment simply from overhearing something. It doesn't help your job when you're being ridiculed about the bad things you do but not praised for the good things. That said management isn't all bad. I have become friends with a few of them and they are pretty cool people most of the time. Overall this place isn't bad if you don't mind working for minimum wage.
good,Exceptional place to work and overall has a good workplace feel to it.
good,Pretty straight forward place to be employed with. Management was always around in my time of need however sometimes i would be placed in another department and left in complete darkness on what to do until an employee gives me the run down.
good,"Pretty decent place to work, management are some of the finest Ive seen. Not sure about the culture now, seems like they are not screening as well as they should at thier bigger stores but the markets are pretty awesome in customer service."
good,"I really liked working at walmart, i still do."
good,"I would not mine working for walmart again, My co workers were wonderful."
good,"They are constantly training us with new information to work better and take better care of the customer. Everyone is important that work with the company. They help the needy and children with school. They help each other in different departments, from the back to the front end."
good,Fun workplace all the permanent employees seemed to know their store and position well.
good,"I enjoyed where I worked. I worked full-time, I did not partake in benefits. I left for work search in college degree"
good,"This was a great place to work. The managers were helpful, and did not get frustrated when I had any questions about what to do."
good,Wal-mart was great learning experience for me in my management career.
good,This is a good company. I was able to keep my day job. It also have good benefit
good,While working at Walmart I learned so many things. The experiences day in and day out were beyond belief. I can truly say Walmart has customer service in mind.
good,"Able to work by your self all day, helping customers as you go, but always with a task at hand to deliver"
good,"I would have to say the greatest part of working for Walmart, was the other employees. They made you feel like you were a part of something great. I always felt like family. The worst part were some of the male managers who sexually harrassed some of the women within my department. Completely unexceptable."
good,Good company to work for. Offers great benefits if you are full-time. Great atmosphere to work in. Gives you a 10% discount on items in the store. You have the ability to advance in the company if thats something you are interested in. They will also cross-train you so you will be able to work other departments of the store if needed.
good,"I learned alot at walmart, customer service , how to be more organized and how to deal nwith dificult people"
good,-Professional management and willing to learn
good,"I loved the friendliness of the people working at Sam's Club. There were always pleasant people to spend break times with and the company was always providing some type of benefit for us. Many times there would be free lunch and supper in the break room. They also provided a birthday cake once a month for those employees who had a birthday that month. I was given financial incentives I didn't even know about until I received my paycheck. There were programs where the employees voted for such things as employee of the month. My favorite manager was voted department manager of the year by his peers. We did have problems within the optical department; such as, the Texas/Mexico laboratories were not efficient. We had many remakes coming directly from the laboratories that we could not pass. I believe this to be one of the main reasons Sam's Club has problems keeping their managers and opticians. The manager's bonus is based on keeping a low remake level. Apparently, this is impossible under the current laboratories' proficiency levels."
good,Everyday is full of activity and it is good for a person that does like change and does some physical work. Team oriented definitely.
good,Working for Wal-Mart was fun and rewarding. I had a variety of tasks and was allowed to help out where ever and when I was needed. It was great to have that kind of variety.
good,"A typical day at work is working with pretty nice people and customer on their cars. Management was not too bad, just didn't understand most of the time because they were never around."
good,Management is nice and hard workers. They will have fun with you and make sure the job gets done also. They very friendly and also seriously handle situations according the problem
good,"* First of all, The head girl of our department is very stritct with some girls, not for all and she is very bad with nature i always wish she will be good with everyone."
good,The good thing about the job is that the associates will help u out if u need help with something. The bad thing is that if associates call out you have to do your task plus more.
good,depende mucho en que zona te acomoden pero a mi en lo personal me gusto mucho por que te mantienes en un area en la cual estas siempre activo de un lado a otro y encargandote del correcto embarque de todas las cajas a mi me gusto.
good,Shipping packing picking inducting I love the job but I was done being flex if they had me full time I will still be there. The manager was friendly if you didn’t know what you was doing they will show you I started off on trucks
good,"Working for Walmart offers benefits, education advancement, career advancement, and training. However, it is a revolving door. The people motivated to work make it and the people looking to slack off and call out do not make it."
good,"Throughout the years I worked for Walmart there was alot of ups and downs.The store manager, and assistant managers were only helpful when they felt like it. Most situations were you fending for yourself even when they needed something fast."
good,Friendly work environment all other associate love helping customers. Kind of a easy company to move up in. They also have amazing benefits to help in the future. I recommend working for this company!!
good,It's cool place to work.Yoy can advance in the company.Managers try to look out as far as hrs go sometimes flexible sometimes not.Overall not many complaints about company.
good,I worked for Walmart for over 12yrs.  Most employees made you feel like family. One problem with this company.  They give u a Quarterly bonus.  Not the same amount.  Unfortunately they cut back your hours so that bonus really doesn't count.  They should just give the employees their 40hrs a week. No biggie.
good,"A uma empresa boa, ajustaria somente o salario, mas o ambiente de trabalho benefícios politica ótimos."
good,Great place to work.  Shift are all over the place.  One day you work days the next evening the back to days.  Management is very friendly  and easy to get along with.
good,The company itself was great. I loved my job. Upper management made things very difficult. My coworkers was amazing! Had flexible hours when needed. But pried into my personal life too often
good,"i liked , the bad think is management promises is always pending ... as a customer service manager is a big responsability benefit good breaks always runing behind"
good,Working for Walmart was great coworkers were amazing and the managers there at Walmart were excellent and amazing also they would check up on us to see how we were doing
good,Empresa Walmart me ajudou muito no meu crescimento profissional. Me deram oportunidade através de recrutamento interno onde passei de operadora de caixa à balconista de farmácia onde tive reconhecimento do meu trabalho.
good,Working at walmart is not at all hard. You just need to know your part and ask questions when you dont. Management is  as helpful as they can be but most times you'll just need to help yourself
good,"The culture here is excellent. I enjoy going to work and have fun when I am there.  There is always an opportunity to advance or change departments."
good,I only left the job because the manager was talking behind my back but all things considered everyone else seemed nice in the month I was there and you could tell they wanted you to be happy.
good,"I like working there, but the sheduleing for full time is all over the place. Fun work place. People are nice. Love the customers that come in. Don't like the hour lunch break. To much time"
good,"A typical day at work was mostly relaxing while I was cashiering, expect for days when there were a lot of customers. I’d say the hardest part was learning how to do the job at first, but you quickly get the hand of things."
good,Walmart should Pat more their employees they do soo much and deal with soo many costumers every day. They should really pay their employees more and hire more employees as well.. Walmart is high volume costumers.
good,"Get hand-held with orders,go shopping for the items on the list,scan them into the right container,talk to customers on phone,head outside to deliver orders, slice deli meats and cheese for customers"
good,"I spent 2 and 1/2 years with the pharmacy at Walmart, I learned a lot and loved my coworkers! I got a lot of practice answering phones and communicating with hospitals and insurance companies!"
good,"A typical work day includes pushing shopping carts into the store for customer use."
good,"Meeting with across functional team Tracking project progress and status"
good,In my almost 5 years working at Walmart I made forever friends with my coworkers and enjoyed my job and everything I did. Walmart is a great company to work for especially as a first job in high school and had many advancement opportunity
good,The hardest part of the job is waking up at 3:00 am to get to work and walking from the backroom to whichever part of the store I'm assing to work at. I like the welcoming environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the costumers.
good,"Stay focused on tasks, work diligently and efficiently, integral work ethic, remain customer service friendly and you will do well.  The retail industry is not for the faint of heart."
good,"I like making people's visit more comfortable, being fast, friendly. There is no hard part at work . It's easy to talk to people and smile. The co-workers are friendly and helpful. I liked my job a lot until they hired people that I was training on the register, making the same amount of money that I was making! That wasn't right! I worked my way up from $9.00 hour, and I helped build that store. That's one reason I have my notice to leave. The other reason was when our quarterly bonuses came out, just because I was part-time they didn't give me any hours all week M-F."
good,Working in the pharmacy is a satisfying job when you are able to help the patients with their needs. Working with the public is both the best and worst part of the job. Be prepared for patients that you love to see and those that have attitudes and are disrespectful.
good,"overall a good job. It was physically demanding at some times but it pays off in the long run. not only was it physically demanding, but it was also mentally challenging at time when you had to think about where certain things go."
good,"Being told to complete a task by one mgr, then moved by another mgr. I felt they didn't communicate with each other and I was working to do as I was told."
good,"Management can be a little bit better, there could be more hours, there is no level of respect, there is favoritism, and management have no Communication whatsoever"
good,"you are able to get your job  truck work done and as well on time and be helpful to the customers /and help other team members when they need help ,and all try to work together."
good,"Working at walmart is a great experience for me because I learned so many things from our on site training and also I do have a great manager and supervisors that they are very supportive and encouraging at all time in any given situation. Now, I am able to provide an exceptional and outstanding customer service to everybody which it includes our customers and my teammates."
good,Working for Walmart has its stigma but they actually do pay decently for the work that you do. The garage got pretty hot during the summer but other than that it was an enjoyable place of work.
good,"Walmart like any other jobs has problems but most of the time they made sure we was okay. The manager at the time and other manager were great, couple of them you don’t want on their bad side.. then work can suck.. especially if it’s your manager"
good,Management was always looking out for workers 2 15 minute breaks an hour lunch alot of interacting with customers alot of technical issues with system
good,"Working at Walmart I had to learn new skills by working with others. It became very difficult when I had to stock grocery products not knowing were to place them. All I was told is that i was working too slow. Had i would have gotten help from other workers telling me where things go until i got use to placing things were they belong,i would be still working there today as an overnight stocker."
good,It was pretty cool working there. I met new friends there. The job kept me busy which is what I wanted. I got to listen to music while I worked and that's always awesome.
good,"I've moved three roles within WM and my experience has been good. People are very collaborative and open. Salary wise, not that great though, but that's an overall Retail problem. "
good,"I worked at a neighborhood market so the atmosphere is different than that of a super center. Less chaotic, more close-knit. Room for advancement in the company, willing to train, relocate in some cases. Seem to prefer to promote good workers from within! They also give back to the community through various charities such as CMN and the Z-Mann Foundation."
good,"It is a decent place to work at while being in school. I was able to go to school get out of school, pick up my brother and then head to work. The pay is good."
good,Just wanted more for myself what's a job I could have grow on and become a better part of the company and being stagnant where I was.  But above all the company experience was great I learned the fundamentals of teamwork and it sense of achievement
good,One of my favourite jobs. I loved working for this company and the profit shares were always a nice bonus. I've never done cake decorating before this job and now it's a skill that I never knew I had.
good,retail is getting harder. lots of exceptions from everyone. moments of care is very important and depending on the day can be fun and interesting. the money is nice.
good,"Desde el inicio hay un trabajo en equipo para dar el mejor servicio al cliente con lo mejor de los productos y la entrega siempre en su lugar."
good,"Pays good and if you stay long enough good benefits but only a 20% discount on anything other than food. To add to the job description, being a stocker you also have to unload a truck so put that in mind when applying."
good,"Era panadero ahi, la verdad no esta mal pero ahi aveces que si te estresas y comonpiso de ventas si es un asco su salario"
good,"Plenty of break time, decent pay and great people. However the goals set by the computer can be a bit unrealistic and management is not very flexible."
good,O local era bom os colegas que não eram do meu setor bons.
good,"The reason why i love working at wal-mart is that they are friendly, and a really organize. The reason i left is because i have to go back to school at time."
good,Es buen ambiente de trabajo aunque un poco estresante se aprende mucho en cuanto a operacion la relacion de gerencia es buena se trabaja bien es dificil llevar acabo todas tus actividades en un solo dia y la culura laboral es excelente
good,Good benifets I learned a lot working at Walmart and I'm very thankful for that Walmart is a good start to work..the management let the associates have their phones with them in the floor and that was the best part of it.
good,Good pay and hours. You get used to being on your feet and moveing around all day..time goes by fast staying productive. I’m now talking to the 150 characters
good,"All good but to much politic's like military but I was likeded good company"
good,I really don't have anything to say about the company.... Sometimes we have a family oriented environment. The attendance policy for associates isn't fair.
good,"management could use some work but overall its nice, clean and friendly. sometimes you might get forgotten but in my mind its doesnt bother me i just do my job."
good,You must be willing to work hard and with others.  Be open to learning new positions. Work close with management and be a team player. Be able to give 100%
good,Walmart is a good place to work but i just wish they gave more hours. Management helps me with all my questions and the rest of my coworkers are pleasant to work with.
good,if you stay out the way and do your job you wont have any problem. management usually don't make a fuss about everything. customers are mostly right at least they think that.
good,Walmart strongly believes in the happiness and satisfaction of all customers. They believe the customer is truely always right. They have amazing work benefits as well
good,"Walmart is the type of place you end up wanting to keep working just to get to see the folks you work with on a regular basis. There really isn't a job within the company that's ""hard,"" but that doesn't mean you don't need to be dedicated to work there. There is a place for almost everyone within the company. The hardest part of working there is dealing with customers who treat you poorly just because you work there. Having a customer tell you how wonderful it is to have someone like you helping them, and especially when they say it in a survey, is really rewarding. This is one of the few companies that pays decently, allows you to work the hours you want and request days off, provides benefits, and dress how you feel most comfortable (within reason.)"
good,"The customers were great."
good,Fast paced environment with focus on production and safety.  As an associate who started as an hourly associate and then was promoted to an area manager I feel like I worked hard and still did the same work as an hourly associate because I wanted to make sure I succeeded
good,"I appreciate the fact that if you do a good job you are rewarded with a promotion."
good,"I loved working with the public, solving customer and associates problems/issues. The hardest part of the job was to leave home every night. Again, I love working with the public."
good,I overall enjoyed working at this location. They seemed to get the agenda done everyday. Would recommend this job for high schoolers looking for an evening job.
good,"Fast paced, always busy.In my experience walmart was a very good company to work for. i really enjoyed working there, and the work environment. Flexibility with scheduling"
good,"Believing in team work and to encourage one an other."
good,Managers were being disrespectful and gave you ridiculous assignments. They will tell you to do something that’s outside your job position description.
good,"Uma empresa q não tenho ND ,a reclamar pois lá tive muitas oportunidades e de lá consegui minha classificação de açougueira"
good,Being acceptable unable to change with The Times. Being able to grow learn and understand what my job at Walmart And what it means to work for walmart.
good,I had the opportunity to work with some really awesome co-workers and met some great customers. management really worked with me to help me advance and grow within Walmart.
good,"Starting salary is 11 dollars an hour, which is nice, but at my store we had issues with advancement. It was seemingly random on who got promotions, and some people who had worked there for years and did great at their jobs were passed up were people who worked there for less than a year and weren't any better than the more experienced person."
good,Algunos Asistentes no toman la responsabilidad correspondiente con los empleados
good,"You are constantly moving around to different registers and helping a diverse array of customers."
good,"Everyone is mostly in a good mood and ready for the work day. Always willing to help others and to teach other that are new to the field. Typical word day consisted of stocking, organizing and cleaning and on occasion being on the register. Management was ok for the most part, and it could use some work. The hardest part for me was that there were employees that didnt like to work so i basically took over and that became frustrating. The most enjoyable part was when i got my job done is a timely manner and would feel accomplished that day. Team work was a big part and honestly working as a team is much better for me cause there is less stress and we get more done."
good,"I worked in the ladies apparel department. My job was honestly the easiest thing you could do I just had lazy co workers which made it harder. I loved the fact nobody bothered me. You have your own section in the store and in the back room as well. Management was terrible but I didn’t bother them, they didn’t bother me lol. If you’ve had a job you’ll know all jobs are the same. As long as you stay to yourself and do your job there will be no problems."
good,They dont really care and they try to make up for it with benefits that you cant get until youve worked there for a year. Points system makes it easy to call out but they dont care about the reason why. They wont even accept doctors notes. The only way you dont get in trouble is if it is pregnancy related.
good,Be prepared to work hard everyday to achieve company directed goals and tasks. Variety of locations to work at is very good. Offers quick advance in career if desired.
good,"Enjoyed meeting and helping customers. Work was not easy in some areas, but was in others. People, some, you work with were helpful in showing you how to do some of your tasks, and some not. Will consider going back to work there again."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was their employees. they were loyal, helpful and very determine to see each one of us succeed."
good,"A daily task of customer service & ordering."
good,I don’t have much to say. If you like it or not will depends on who’s on your team or who’s your manager. But my experience is that it wasn’t organized enough in the back to do my job faster but if you work hard enough you can get stuff done on time
good,Just be able to get get involve with customers and associate's on black friday from getting everything ready to when the events or sales took place to see how things were setup how to be able to handle sitiuations duri g a really busy time
good,"While working at Wal-Mart, you will meet all kinds of people, both customers and employees. overall you will pick up both social and work skills, that you will use in any field."
good,"Ser empacador fue una experiencia grata para un primer empleo, te ponen reglas y se deben cumplir, pero lo bueno es que tus compañero son de tu edad."
good,"The Job Was Okay , It Couldve Been Better On Its Paying But I Mean Thats Walmart For You . I Liked It There Just To Far From Home And Waste Of Gas . They Were Nice Though"
good,I’ve been there several years and I love the customers.  They are the reason I stay.  Everyday is something different.  I work with a great group of people
good,"The management was always changing, with the brings good and bad. You would see good and fair managers come and go, but you would also see bad and unreasonable managers come and go as well. The fellow employees were one of the best parts about the job, as well as the discount and benefits."
good,"The management was very friendly. More experienced co-workers are very helpful and informative to newcomers. My experience was very positive, as was most of the staff."
good,"Walmart is a leader in the industry to be inclusive and diverse.  A worldwide retailer that seeks to meet customers needs in every market they operate.  Additionally, Walmart is a leader in sustainability striving daily to reduce waste.  These two important areas make Walmart a great company to a part of."
good,"I loved working with the employee's , just not so much with some of the managers they just do things a little different. Loved the costumers that was the highlight of my day."
good,Overall walmart was a good place to work good people to work with but they need to fix things with management besides that overall good work environment
good,"mediocre benefits for work expected. management and leader's are not the best, but the work isn't too hard. Good amount of breaks for the length of shifts."
good,"Ótima para se trabalhar, te oferece crescimento profissionalmente"
good,"Well I worked in the deli so you work closes with your coworkers. I got close to all of them so working there was super fun plus I love cooking food really does pass the time by very nicely, cooking cleaning helping costumers made 8 hours feel like 3, and they pay very well."
good,"Wasn’t too bad working here, I did enjoy it at first but after awhile I was given tasks that someone inside could’ve done & that set me back from what I was doing. It’s has decent pay & I would recommend applying for a different position instead of the one I did."
good,"It’s really easy and you’re basically on your own, you take breaks when you want and you just do your part majority of the time. The only thing wrong is that they’re based on points so no matter your situation you’ll get a point for being late or missing work due to anything."
good,Flexible schedule for students. Good hours and bonuses. Great place to put your customer service skill me to the test. Management was fair whenever there was a problem.
good,It is what you make it; which can be great. Lots of opportunities. Healthcare field is growing and evolving.  Sometimes the volume of customers and lack of employees makes things difficult.
good,"Foram vários anos trabalhando e me dedicando a esta empresa, muito triste quando se e descartado sem consideração..."
good,Working for Walmart is a very busy job always moving and always looking for ways to improve the company. Management is almost always helpful in teaching you what you need to know to complete your job
good,It was nice working with customers and my coworkers I knew and we all helped each other make Walmart a better place to shop and communicate with people.
good,"I worked in the distribution center. It’s hard work and production based but my coworkers and managers were really nice and supportive. It was honestly just a really bad time to be working there for me since I already lived far away and was moving farther. I got $17.10 an hour as an order filler and base pay in there is 16 dollars. There are strict attendance rules, if you are even a minute late that counts as a half point against you and after the five hour mark you get the other half. On ‘key days’ (holidays) point worth is doubled, if you get 5 points in a 6 month period you will be terminated."
good,"just like any retail rph position. not any better or worse. changing strategies every day, not valuing the front line employees that are making the money for them. it all depends on who is your district manager and your manager to make your life unbearable or fair to work at."
good,"I was able to mostly just do my own thing with little interference from management as long as I was finishing my work. Very friendly management, nice co-workers and very easy work."
good,"Great as a first time job, lots of room to expand and grow as an individual in the company. It wasnt my career goal so I decided to leave the company, but the six years I was there for was good. The scheduling is very flexible for your needs, hours can be hard to come by at times, but you can always transfer to other stores that may have more full-time availability."
good,"Great place to work while going to college. I have great coworkers that make a day at work easy. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting through Black Friday. Other than that, everything is pretty easy."
good,It's a retail store.  The store manager was pretty cool. Not a lot to stress about pretty much anything you'd expect from a retail store. The benefits are good.
good,I Met so many amazing people that helped me better myself and be the person I am today. Everyone was always so willing to help in anyway possible and being taught something new didn’t feel like a struggle
good,"I found that the work and environment  was smooth, and easy to get used to. My team of associates definitely made the day interesting. Managment, however, was somewhat lacking in competency that one should expect."
good,"Always a steady pace of work. Good people on staff easy to work with. Upper management will give you no leeway, do your job or you will be written up."
good,"Walmart was okay, they have a lot to work on, management acts like they’re better, Associates are friendly then go behind your back, and Breaks could be better"
good,"Good place to work if its your first job. You can easily  trust the people around you, management needs to be more open to employees suggestions in some departments."
good,"A typical day is fast-paced and delightfully challenging with something new to do every single day. I learned many valuable skills like reading module labels, running a register, and setting up phone services through prepaid providers. Management was always on top of issues, making sure the store was being run properly and was presentable to our customers. The hardest part of the job was going in blind with little to no retail experience but coming out with valuable insight and respect. The most enjoyable part was meeting great new people every day and making customers smile in any way that I could."
good,"Many departments that can use a variety of skills. Management takes into consideration needs of employees all the time making work and social life much easier. Days, evenings, night shifts offered so there is a time slot that can work with anyone's schedule."
good,Over all Walmart was a good company to work for they were really flexible with there hours some managers were supper friendly to the employees Walmart was my very first job and as a young kid Walmart taught me a lot about having patience and taking just that little bit or time asking a customer how there day was could change there whole mood for the better
good,Walmart is a good place to work to learn about different retail environments. Employees are constantly moving. Understanding of the disabled lack quite a bit. But if you love to constantly be running around from one side of the store to the other this is the ideal job for you.
good,Foi satisfatória minha experiência na empresa sinto saudades apesar de ter saido
good,"I truly like working at Walmart. There were times where the schedule didn't make sense or they wouldn't provide the hours that you would expect, but over all it was not a bad work environment as long as you mind your own business, stay out of gossip, and do your job."
good,Walmart is not the best company to work for but its also not the worst company to work for. It has its ups and downs  but the customers and some of the associates is what makes going to work there the best.
good,"Great place to work and learn a lot about the company Sam started. If committed, you could easily grow into this company.  It happened to me..  Just be yourself."
good,"Got injured on the job and they fired me , went to the doctor, the doctor put me on pain medication & light duty, the pain was bad at work & I couldn't handle the strong pain medication, so I would have to leave work early, Walmart or should I say managment got tired of me being absent so they fired me."
good,"While it has perks to work there, there is an overall sense of 2 sides of Walmart. The people and the corporate side. And while the people are fun loving and nice and make you enjoy your job, the corporate side of a point system and low pay make it undesirable, it's a good starter job, but not a career in my opinion."
good,I picked this job up as a second job they was understanding and worked around my schedule of my first job and have been very helpful in helping learn at a job ive never done
good,"They don't always listen to their employees, the people lead does more often then the rest. The machinery went down more often than it should've but hand pushing carts isn't too hard if you know how to do it."
good,They where hard at work and had good breaks we had alot of things  we had to unload and put away we used cutting utunciles to open boxes and stack everything on chelfs
good,"colaborativo, trato amable por los compañeros, sin problemas"
good,"The warehouse is a unsafe location that needs people who are very safety conscious. Yet, you can only be as safe as the environment around you. They need to improve on updating equipment/ making the equipment safer for their employees (ex. no broken pallets). One of the best things Walmart has to offer is that is easy to advance your career within the industry if that is your personal goal."
good,A typical work day at Walmart is a bunch of fun and learning how to interact with different types of people it’s fun and life experiencing. My most enjoyable part of my job was just being able to help and have fun.
good,They are always good on trying to put new people in the company to help better the company and the persons knowledge of work teaching them something and giving them a job is always great
good,"Walmart days went by pretty fast because you are always busy. Working at Walmart there’s a lot of things i learned such as working forklifts, stocking properly and etc. some managers at Walmart like to pick on people, and you have few that are good at there job and know how to make people understand them with out doing the most. There’s not really nothing hard about working a Walmart it was a smooth job. The thing that was most enjoyable is stocking in department you wanted to be in because it peaceful unless you have to help customers."
good,I have been working for Walmart off and on since 2004. Walmart is a wonderful company to work for. I call my coworkers my work family. I love the area I work in. There really isn't anything hard about my job because I have been doing it for so long
good,"Most associates are easy to get along with and the work isn't very difficult, the management team is easy to talk to for the most part and very few issues when you need something resolved"
good,"Enseña todo respeto a perecederos, mercancía general y sobre inventarios"
good,Good job for a high school student. Flexible with school and extra curricular activities. Near the end of my time there it was dreadful because Managers wouldn't train new employees on the self checkout and every shift they'd assign me to self-checkout to stand and do nothing for 8 hours. I just like to be busy though.
good,"A typical day would involve using your badge to clock in, proceeding to your register, engaging your client and bagging their items. Its normal to be standing for the whole day. Guaranteed 15 minute break every 3 hours of work, with a 30 minute lunch when working 6+ hours, and a 1 hour lunch when working 8+ hours."
good,I look forward to working with the family team at walmart I will want to help as best I can food stock electronics associate sales whatever is aviable.
good,expérience très enrichissante. Beaucoup de formation qui nous prenait d’être polyvalent
good,Energetic environment. Great advancement opportunities. Walmart has a great stocking system if you follow the science you will be rewarded. All jobs have some managerial issues. If you can deal that. You have a great job. You could stay at for some years
good,"Supervisors/management isn't always over your shoulder, however you are held accountable.  What really stinks is that our jobs were outsourced overseas and I am stuck looking for something new.  I really enjoyed my time here and made some great friends."
good,"How to stock, sort clothes, clearance merchandise. I use to train people, but no compensated for my work. Just got regular pay. They don't appreciate there employees."
good,"Walmart was a good job, most coworkers were nice. The managment was also very good, the only bad being they were sometimes slow and took a minute to help. Besides that i enjoyed working as a cashier at walmart. However i found it repetitive doing the same thing, I like to help were help is needed."
good,"i loved working at walmart. people made you feel like family. as long as you're patient and understanding, the customers are no issue. my biggest problem was unprofessional management when store managers treated you like a low life and CSM's not trying to look out for you but for themselves."
good,I really liked it for the first two years then management changed and things got crazy. Management wasn’t nice or caring like before and bonuses started dropping and hours started being cut.
good,"Learned a lot working at Walmart, as a cashier and a cake decorator. I moved around a lot as management saw fit. The hardest part of the job was lack of communication, otherwise good experience."
good,My experience with Walmart overall is the great considering the work load is never a dry day especially when u have multiple trucks on one day...the managers are okay for the most part and so are co workers...and the customer keep you on your toes
good,"This is not a bad job at all. It is fairly reasonable across the board. Especially when it comes to competitive pay, benefits, and the job itsself. There are always people there to help if need be. So Wal-Mart is not too shabby of a place to work."
good,"Great advancement opportunities with appropriate compensation.  Greatest school of retail available for hands on experience.  "
good,"Leadership is honest good moral base company, hard to move up in with low wages.  Hard to get fulltime job in the company too. But the coworker and leadership is always friendly and willing to help."
good,"I had wonderful experiences here. The people I worked were great and the managers were approachable. The only issue I had was when I had to lessen my availability due to child care issues, and they had a computer system making the schedule and it did not take limited availability into account. It would just fill the spot for that day and it would not go to the person with that available day first."
good,Walmart was a crest experience it was just to far for me to travel they help you grow and build they are very helpful and caring I loved working with them
good,"Very flexible work schedule.  "
good,Walmart is a ever changing market always advancing in to the future.  Walmart has made a lot of changes to the way they do things.  Great place to work and am thankful for Walmart!
good,Aside from a few minor altercations and the fact I was asked to work 12-14 hourd regularly due to short staffing I did enjoy working here. There is a clear structure and way things are expected to be done and aiming for efficient and urgent stocking will help you climb the Walmart ladder.
good,Overall I enjoyed working there. The location was close to home and the hours were great. The customer were always nice to me. My co-workers always helped of I needed it.
good,"At the time I worked there, there was a lot of favoritism going on. I had a hospital take me out of worked and they counted those days and fired me for it. Pay though was great. I started at $9, and I ended up at $11."
good,"My day consisted of completing various tasks such as stocking and register whilst using machinery and technology to achieve. I think the best skill I took away from there was my forklift license. Management was all around helpful, flexible and great which correlates to the whole work environment. Everyone I worked with was nice and I would consider most  friends. The hardest part of working there were the customers mainly considering it was customer service."
good,"When I worked at Walmart I was in two locations, the first was in Fredericksburg, VA in Southpoint and I actually enjoyed my job. My manager gave me different tasks throughout the day to keep me busy and help my other coworkers, also my manager gave me opportunities to ""run the show"" when they weren't there. The second location I worked at was in Virginia Beach, VA on Phoenix Dr, this location provided the same tasks everyday and I became bored and tired of them. Also our manager was beginning to change something everyday instead of allowing the new idea time to work."
good,it was a good place to work great people just had to do better for me and my family and the management there was not very good. I had to leave to make more money for my family
good,I am a very hard worker with a lot of work ethic. I am a determined individual who works better alone but also does well with team work. I love to get all the big things out the way and then start with little.
good,a typical day was kinda you looked forward to going to work but those last two hours its just you wanting to go home but overall its a really good job if your thinking about applying
good,"Fast Paced Environment"
good,"i know that not every job can be fun or easy and it’s walmart, every one shops there so of course it’s going to be fast paced. but it kind of depends on who your manager is and the people around you because i had family and friends there so it was fun. but the manager was pretty strict and kind of watched us and didn’t really want to hear the employee side of the story-from my coworkers, i didn’t really get that. i just knew to do my work but the CSM’s were really annoying and unhelpful at times. we learned to help ourselves but i wish they would help more because of my age and how busy walmart can be. the pay is really good and i would recommend Walmart. i was a cashier and that’s like not the best position there lol i’m not sure why i applied for that part. stocking is more of what others recommend because you kind of take your own breaks instead of waiting for people who never come. and it’s more fa"
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is a nice place to work, but that can vary depending on the management at the store. Some management make it fun and exciting to come to work.  Others drag moral down by their poor skills and miss management."
good,Wal-Mart is an excellent place to work with the right management team in place. I have been lucky to have that happen for me not once but twice. In two different states.
good,"The work consisted of keeping the store floor organized and presentable, and unpacking boxes and stocking the store shelves."
good,"Good place,worked as a cashier for a few months, fast paced,set breaks and there is always help when needed it. Great company, couldn't say much because only been there 4 months"
good,"A typical day was eventful. "
good,"Wal-Mart is by no means an easy job, nonetheless i have found it to be very rewarding in the long run. Ive always surrounded myself with hard workers to keep me on my toes."
good,"Good workplace, I learned to deal with many different types of people. It was difficult when people did not work the same amount or as hard.  The hardest part was making sure everyone was doing their share of the work."
good,Given the many opportunities to succeed within the company I felt a sense of belonging and progression. It was rewarding to know that I started working the backroom a worked my up to a management.
good,"Walmart is a good company for maintenance technicians. Walmart maintenance puts safety at the top of their priorities.  Sometimes its tough scheduling repairs when operations is stressing production numbers, but just follow the rules and you can learn a lot every day there. They are very military friendly and never have a problem with my military obligations. I just wish there were more opportunities on 1st shift."
good,"la forma de trabajo resulta dinamica, siempre hay algo que hacer, porque resulta movido y no aburrido, la atención al cliente es lo primordial, tiene normas estrictas pero nada exagerado."
good,"Walmart is one of those jobs that either you like it or you dont. I personally loved it, yes there were days when I wanted to scream but overall I really enjoyed working there. My co workers became family and to this day we still talk and get together. "
good,"Most people who shop at Walmart and never see an employee isn't because the employees are hiding from them, they are hiding from management because they will get pulled into a different department because that department's employees are lazy. So instead of completing your own tasks you have to help someone who isn't even trying to complete them."
good,I worked in many different positions I worked as a cashier then I went to electronics where they also had me work as a sales floor toys Association and lawn and garden associate so I’m very well rounded and easily can adapt to new positions. So I can be helpful in more than one position. Now I’m an apparel associate so I fold and zone and put up returns in diff et departments and also help with the fitting room from time to time where I help customers into the fitting rooms and answer and direct calls
good,Store level management does not care about there employees. They will belittle you till your breaking point. Benefits are wonderful though. 10 weeks maternity leave plus 6 weeks bonding leave.
good,"This job is great for anyone who needs a few extra bucks in their pockets. Management tries to help in cases where they are needed, but mostly it is on the employee to fix things. Working here, a positive attitude is necessary as working with a few hundred employees you can start to feel like a number on a spreadsheet. Hardest part of the job is that they may cut hours from your schedule to keep their budgets in line. Some people will be cut 2-6 hours a week while others get 20+ hours cut a week depending on how long you have worked there. Raises are not given when you feel deserved, but just based on how long you work there."
good,"Working at Walmart, it was nice to get things set up for kids because seeing the kids happy along with making the parent’s job easier when it comes to picking out toys is a wonderful sight."
good,i have good experience in walmart the maneger help me everything to need due and my corwoker holp me what to do in the my work a do good my job faster
good,"i enjoy being at work. i often find myself coming into work when not scheduled to talk to friends ive made while working. the management is good. i enjoy work because i learn alot, the pay is good, great people."
good,"Job is fast paced and hard on your feet and back. CSMs are all good to work with. I find that although it is constantly too busy, I enjoy it. Management is easily approachable."
good,It’s nice environment. Benefits are okay and the. Flexibility is great once they get to know you/name fully in system.Will having you working in the pets stocking one day the next your in food. I like so because you meet new and different people around then different areas
good,"Empresa con cultura gringa muy centrada en el reconocimiento, muy buen ambiente laboral, pero con cargos poco claros en su definición y poco recursos para la consecución de objetivos de mediano y largo plazo.-"
good,All staff was really good different experience of my life work was fast paced but I liked time goes fast everybody very friendly over there if I don’t moved Calgary I would like to keep this Job
good,I love with around people and staying busy it makes the time go by so much faster. I also have always enjoyed love working with money my drawers were always dead on when counted out.
good,You like it here.Helping the customer is first. Making  sure  everything  is looking  good. And the customer  will come back. Having  the product  in the store  is very helpful  to our customers.
good,"Not a terrible company but not 5 stars at the same time. Management and security could be better. Management never asks for more than what you’re hired for. Some CSM’s are laid back and nice to work with. Coworkers are amazing, sweet, and caring."
good,I worked here for almost 4 years and had good and bad experiences working here we also went through store management so that alone was difficult to manage the whole stores employees
good,Currently an auto care center manager at Wal-Mart. It is a challenging job. I like a challenge when it comes to work. I work better with one. Thank you.
good,good experience working here! Alot of overtime hours if you need them & very understanding of not making it to work & for switching schedules! Loved it here.
good,good luck  2  it was fun the people was nice dope workers wear nice look up Elvis knives everything was nice just nice I work and put stuff up make milk age hot dogs sausage bacon yogurt orange juice it was fun it was nice it was fun it was nice fun and nice it was nice fun
good,"If you are looking for a job that doesn't require you to be face to face with customers it is the job for you."
good,"it is a great place to work, benefits are great. Sometimes the work/life balance can get complicated. It is hard to move from one area of the company to another."
good,the point system was tricky it led to alot of my fellow coworkers losing their jovs including myself it doesnt reflect reality of life and everyday mishaps
good,I really liked my job and all the associates I worked with. Walmart is a good place to work and i would work for them again and there is some opportunity for advancement.
good,"The company is is a large company with many options as long as you have the drive to grow. Just like any other company you have good management and terrible management, it is really luck of the draw."
good,Monotonous workdays where one can relax if they are doing their job.  Management is always fair and only punishes those that are actually at fault.  Workplace culture is fun and upbeat.  Hardest part of the job is to deal with other employees that are not like-minded with me.
good,Good company to work for. Management can make or break the environment of the store. Good discount and benefits. Quarterly bonuses earned if certain criteria’s are met.
good,"Fast paced work, stocking in the Produce Section of the store. Assists customers. And also involves lifting of quantities to the shelf, and culling the expired fruits and vegetables."
good,From my experience getting work done was priority and customer service was steady it was a daily basis thing. Networking throughout the workplace was a must.
good,"Really enjoyed being an apartment manager, would like to go back to being apartment manager somewhere in Marysville or Yuba City. I’m a fast learner and get along good with my co workers, bosses. When I was an apartment manager I collected rent, deposited the rent into owners bank, made appointments for tenants for repairs and etc."
good,"Aucun temps mort, il y a toujours quelque chose a faire, le temps peu passer tres vite. "
good,I enjoy working at Walmart and learning every time I go to work something new. Management team is very supportive and caring of employees and the needs of every individual.
good,"From what I remember working at Walmart was always stressful. When working cashier i was also required to stock tobacco products, fix end caps, and front sale items."
good,"A typical day at my job would consist of nothing going too badly, practically smooth sailing.  The carts would be gathered, the trash picked up or cleared, and the customers helped whether I offered or were asked.  My managers, for the most part, were decent with two or three exceptions of brilliant examples of true leadership.  However, I politely left because I felt that, as an employee who worked tirelessly for everyone around him, I wasn't being treated with the respect I deserved, or at the very least, the problems I saw that needed rectifying weren't being handled properly."
good,I liked working there as they paid well but they were not very flexible with hours as working there and going to high school took a toll on my grades. They were not flexible with the hours they had given me.
good,Interesting job remodeling store was offered advancment but was not happy with the auto center duties. Worked in plant center and assisted in doffernet areas after remodel was completed.
good,Good first job experience. They didn't let me finish my training program completely. Other than that it was a good work environment and I would work there again.
good,"Worked in the ""new"" Global Business Services corporate office in Charlotte. Initially, the job was great, the people were great, and the overall atmosphere was great. After management started to change, new requirements and expectations were implemented, which were more difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, a great company to work for."
good,I enjoy working at Walmart. I wish they paid employees a better compensation. The job requires us to do more than just work at a cashier and that should include extra pay.
good,working for the company was an interesting experience. yes there was some problems with management but they ended up getting done with what they had to.
good,Working here was where I gained most of my work experience. During the time of me working it was a fun and fulfilling job. As time went by I wish I could’ve advanced further but felt as if it was a little harder as management consistently changed.
good,"working at walmart can be a frustrating, fun, furious, fantastic, good and bad. its full of everything you can think of. you witness the world because its a store for everyone to come and shop and look and walk around even galavant."
good,"I am a hands on person, willing to teach and learn as well. Love feedback from others on different ideas to explore within the company. Treat people the way want to be treated. And I love to help people move up with their career within the company."
good,A typical day at work was continuous stocking of items. The hardest part was when helping other in department. The most enjoyable was assisting customers and learning to work outside my comfort zone.
good,"Honestly suggest for young people, it was my first job and I enjoyed it and made a decent amount of money. They were flexible with hours and off days as well"
good,It was ok to work for Walmart... Fun and fast paced. Great stock options. Cool staff. Management needs a bit of working with. But over enjoyable. Might consider working there again.
good,"Very productive day."
good,my experience with walmart was fair i would suggest it to others depending on which location you go to they have good management and fantastic displays but they could use work with better training
good,"I enjoy the department manager roll, there are associates I train and work as a team with, I meet different people everyday, I have the opportunity to work outdoors and run some machinery such as a forklift, esp, walkie stacker, & electric pallet jack."
good,"Walmart has been a  great starting point upon entering USA. With no job experience in US I found Walmart to be the only website where I could apply without being frustrated; without having to skip a question where work in USA was an absolute requirement. I started in Walmart as a cart pusher, advancing to front end cashier and ending work as service desk associate. Walmart had been helpful through all. even when I moved out to study, Walmart worked with my schedule and allowed me to leave as well."
good,"benefício,  respeito ,carga Horária, oportunidade ,"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart consisted of great customer service, scanning merchandise, bagging groceries, and cleaning work area. As an employee  we sometimes dealt with furustrated customers, but met their expectations."
good,"Customers are very rude sometimes, but good benefits and good pay, just looking for something less stressful. Coworkers are great, friendly, and helpful."
good,"La evolución en la empresa es continua tanto en el aspecto de ventas como con el personal, hay cosas que no se pueden hacer a un lado como la presión que se sufre por temporadas, en el tratar de llegar a la meta pero aun así el ambiente laboral es forjado entre el mismo personal que se esfuerza sin lugar a dudas de entregar lo máximo para la causa necesaria."
good,"Co-workers were great, just didn't have enough time to spend at home. Someday's were so busy that by the time i got back with the carts all the ones i had just brought were already gone and on other days i didn't have collect carts until the end of my shift. Very back and forth between busy and relaxed."
good,It was cool for the most part it's just gets stressful around Christmas. And the mangers was alright when I was there. U have to fast on the truck especially on 2 truck days
good,"Good place to work, friendly people. Fast-paced environment at times. Good job for entry-level worker. Be prepared to work any hours and to have hours changed if needed."
good,"I enjoyed my job and the role i played in our store, i just would've appreciated more support from our management team as they were generally quite lazy."
good,"Loved working here and all the friends I made but sadly due to management, decided I no longer wanted to work here. The manager I had was not considerate when it came to scheduling, and bullied the co-workers, also didn't allow workers to grow."
good,I got to learn how to manage my school and working. Experiencing adulthood or the first time working was the best part of working at Walmart. I’ve learned a lot through this past year working as retailer
good,"The job was easy, stocking and such, but the supervisors seemed to have a large lack of communication between themselves.  The only real problem I had with the job was the inability to advance, or the apparent block I had in moving up."
good,The job was great! I got tons of great experience and I enjoyed working there for the most part. They paid appropriately and we always had the material to do our job. My only issue was with parts of the management team not being on the same page half the time.
good,"Walmart is a love hate relationship, lots of opportunities for advancement but not necessarily a company you would want to advance in. Given the fact the higher up you go store level, the more you’re expected to do but never allowed overtime."
good,working simi indepedently and colaboratively. Taking pride in work at morning store opening. Everyone doing their job to accomplish the end result: provide on shelf products for the customer.
good,I love it here but they need to pay more! The leadership is fair and understanding and they actually care about you as a person! Only real complaint I have is the base pay rate should be comparable to competitors like Target who pay $14 an our to start!
good,I was tasked with putting stock up. I also helped with customer service. I ran the cash register at beauty. I work well with others.i also helped with shoes. I'm very motivated and goal driven I give my very best at work I complete my goals. I have very high standards I love to work. I am a widow and my children are grown up.
good,A typical day working at walmart can tend to either get extremely busy or be very slow with not much to do. I have learned a lot of people skills and how to handle upset customers. Walmart is very LGBTQ+ friendly so working there I felt like I got to be myself.
good,"My honest review is that a lot of management doesn't care about personal or home issues, which is normal in a workplace. However when it comes to affect your work I believe management should help you figure out how to balance these issues."
good,"There will always be grumbles everywhere you go.  I enjoy working here, love most of the staff, management is always helpful for the most part! No complaints! It’s a part time get me out of house and maybe try more?"
good,Be on time and take criticism well but it can be a rewarding job if you work well independently and as a team as well as able to work at a fast and consistent pace.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. They also hire many people with disablities. The training was very good, but I feel the management called me in for silly and minor reasons."
good,"I loved making sure products were ordered and coming in "
good,"Muchos relación con el cliente."
good,"There were a lot of people who worked hard at doing nothing, leaving the rest to carry work load."
good,"I was able to learn about the front end, stock room, and retail department in the store. The company gave me great customer service experience withi the ability to converse with customers and develope good peoblem solving abilities."
good,I see a constant flow of customers and a lot of repeat customers. Manager availability is very high and there are always areas to get more hours from. If you want to work then you can work.
good,"Can be very demanding due to increased traffic around the holidays. Being in the pharmacy is rewarding, but also very stressful. Only thing I did not like was having to be on my feet all day especially during 10hr shifts. Not aloud to sit like all the other pharmacies!"
good,"I started working as an electronics and photo sales associate. Help customers with sales on TV's, phones, speakers and other electronic devices. The photo department is connected to electronics so I also assist customers with printing photos on our photo kiosks."
good,"Great place to work at when in college, they really work with your school/athletics schedule. So thankful for this job experience and their understanding."
good,"I worked in the clothing and baby department. I was taught how to stock the shelf's, and properly clean up messes. How to report stole or broken things."
good,Walmart is the best company to work for if you love retail. The pay/benefits can't be beat. Being a salaried manager is tough. Typically you work 50 hours at minimum and probably 60-70 during Christmas and Inventory. Despite the heavy amount of worked hours Walmart offers plenty of time off to compensate for that.
good,It was a fun experience but I would like to find a job that I feel comfortable with. The experience at Walmart was a okay experience but now I would like a better opportunity at another store.
good,"Walmart was a good place to work but I feel my multiple choice answers didn't explain everything that I wanted them to. So with vacations and paid time off for sick days, you're guaranteed one hour of paid time off for every 10-20 hours you work I think? And yes we do have uniforms but its just the vest, non ripped pants, and shirt that at least covers your shoulders (these dress codes do apply to EVERYONE) and close toed shoes. Would not recommend if you struggle to get to work on time or if you have any major life events happening. I quit because I was losing hours and racking up occurrences from countless family emergencies and its not ideal. BUT Walmart does now offer the Educational Time Off program where students can apply for leave to finish school and still be hired at Walmart. Before this you had to resign and reapply but all they need is a school schedule and an ID and you can get that time off."
good,I liked the job but didn't care for the management.. Overall it was a good job and the people there were good people to work with. And I kinda wanna go back.
good,Not much needs to be said. If you need a job to make minimum ends meat. Walmart is a good place to start. Management tries their best to get employees to work hard but honestly when you make minimum people are gonna act like they're making minimum. show up for work and they'll treat you right.
good,"- Typical day includes pulling cash registers, zoning, hosting the self checks "
good,There's a lot of unfairness in this company. The more dedicated you are the less you are appreciated. I just want to be appreciated and not worry about my hours getting cut every week.
good,"If you are a hard working person this is a good job for you. Easy to advance if you really want it. Can transfer to any Walmart in any State. I transferred from Miami,Fl to Columbus, Oh"
good,"opportunities for growth."
good,It has been a decent job. Have has good experiences. The pay is good to start but do not give many raises. Would recommend this job for some one just starting out or in college.
good,"I liked my job at Walmart, I just needed more hours. Got along with management, good opportunities to advance ,I had to leave because I was only part time and my hours were getting cut here and there."
good,"Because I worked the graveyard shift,we got a lot of work done,because it was not as busy as the morning or afternoon shift.During the time that was employed the management were very hands on.The people that work with were friendly.The hardest part of the job was trying to keep merchandise on the shelf.The most enjoyable part was learning how to operate the register."
good,"I've grown in the 2 years I've worked at Wal-Mart. I learned a lot about people, business, retail and even about life. I made a lot of friends working at the location I worked at and even worked with people I ended up not liking. A typical day at work depends on your department. Customers ask many dumb questions on the daily. Customers will give you attitude. You'll end up hating people to a certain degree. I think management will depend on where you are at. Some managers I worked with are flat out terrible but some great but even the great ones are still human and make mistakes. The workplace culture was great."
good,It kept me busy taught me a lot of work ethics. I learned how to be a team leader the mangers were nice it made me stronger  by loading trucks. The hours were decent.
good,Overall walmart was a good work experience with lots of potential for learning and growth as an individual. Pay was good and it was almost like a family environment.
good,"I enjoyd the work environment and would recommend working there for anyone it had good pay and flexible but the day hours were a little long, i appreciated the job."
good,My immediate Supervisor was very fair to work with and overall the management was great. I was taught how to operate the electric pallet jack and the walkie stacker. The co-workers were helpful and friendly.
good,A decent employer with multiple chances for advancement and showcasing my individual work skills.  I have been given chances to lead others and to demonstrate my leadership skills and job knowledge.
good,Over my two years at Walmart I have grown a lot! It is a pretty solid place to start out working at. The interview process was easy and everyone works together for the most part.
good,The pay is decent for the job just is not much room for advancement without transferring to other stores. Get to work with great people so it makes the job much more enjoyable.
good,Walmart is a food distribution warehouse. Work is a fast pace logistics warehouse that services all the walmarts within a two hundred mile radius with all dry and perishable foods
good,"Spent 7 years at Walmart. Thanks to my direct supervisors being decent people, I was able to handle the job soundly. Like any workplace, there will always be individuals that employ questionable practices, but thanks to the systems Walmart has in place, these individuals can be reported to the right people. Long story short, you're unlikely to find managers that will outright break rules, since Walmart has low tolerance for those sorts of things, but that won't stop bad eggs from making their way into the system on rare occasion. Your mileage may vary."
good,"Honestly, if our management team was better then it wouldnt be a problem working for them anymore. As a member of management i just think that Assistant need to learn how to be team members."
good,good place to worki got along with most everybody the hours were great and the working conducing  were nice and work load was busy  but very doable most of the time.
good,"Overall, good company to work for. The company is still strong and operates by it's core values. I have personally have meet some really good people their and have become friends outside of the four walls."
good,You get on the job training as well as computer training. You earn time off and benefits for every employee. You can get promoted within the store for different areas of the store. Its a nice place to work.
good,"I loved working at the Company, toward the end of my senior we changed managers changed the management in a at first distasteful way. I love the company like I said I had to leave for College which was a hard decision."
good,Great place for a first job. You will get 40 hours. Managment is more than happy to help and train if you feel you need it. Nice people to work with and good traing.
good,A lot of busy work but it’s no to bad management can be a pain sometimes but they are for the most part helpful and the pay is not to bad co workers are usually nice.
good,"it was a fast pace place to work at, i liked going the extra distance for customers, i liked the fact that walmart managers understood that there were days i couldnt make it to work because of family matters"
good,Walmart is a great job especially if your looking for a consistency in the workplace. Great benefits and incentives.  Management and co-workers aren't the best tho.
good,It was an okay job but the turnover rate was a lot I work in the deli and they don't want to give you the hours you want they just want to work you when they want to work you they put you as part time but give you full time hours so you don't get the benefits it's not a bad job and if you have experience the pay is good it's just I don't like the hours
good,Empresa correta com os funcionários tanto com o salário como.com os benefícios.
good,"I had a set position that held a set schedule I could work with. I enjoyed working with most of my teammates. The benefits were AWESOME and not outrageously priced. It would be a nice job if you plan on growing with the company. My only issues were the store manager treated his managers unfairly, and in turn, they treated the hourly employees unfairly, and that created a high turnover rate that made a heavy workload for most of the employees."
good,Not a bad job just don't have no free time fir you or your family good benefits n they are every where with free lunch from time to time from manger he really good guy
good,"Benefits are good, not a bad inbetween job for someone looking for work experience. Education and pay benefits are the best in the field. Currently using them to get my education so that I can further my career."
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading and/or loading 3-5 trucks throughout my day. We would have to stack the boxes accordingly to weight and neatness. I learned how to handle high stress situations and motivation to complete my goals at the rate expected. Management was very fun and relaxed for the most part. Management was easy to talk to and very understanding about things. I was glad to have such a great supervisor. The workplace is very fast paced and a bit stressful. The coworkers are great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with 3 trucks at one time while at the same time making sure to not lag behind. It was definitely a workout for the mind and body. The most enjoyable part of the job was the independence of the job. The ability to relax and take care of my truck loads when things are not busy and high stress,"
good,We start off with a a meeting and our goals for the night then we begin our night and proceed to stock shelves everyone is friendly and helpful if you don't understand something and cant find what you're looking for someone is more than happy to help
good,"The most enjoyable part of Wal-mart is customer interaction , making sure your customer finds everything he/ or she needs and or wants. i loved working fir this company."
good,would of loved to advance but i had to move and i quit. i loved my managers they were super understanding. it was a great place to just go to clock in and know everyone can just kick back do their thing and get everything done team work and trust was key in this work environment.
good,"I enjoyed working under my supervisor, I liked the work and job title I had. Management was decent and quick to fix issues. Pay was better than average."
good,"Great hard working people make the difference. Good scheduling with days off, but extremely long work days when you have to go in.Overall great experience."
good,"Working at Walmart isn't difficult at all. The main problem is management, they do not know how to treat their employees. Sometimes they tend to take advantage of them."
good,Very good news and good for you here to bathe with me tomorrow night in the br area and I 8th to be there at work rn in my car with my mother in a few weeks after you got home from work and she said that you are not
good,I’m Employed at Walmart now and I really enjoy my job I just wish I could go Full-Time I’ve worked 5 months and I’m still part time I Feel the Managers are tryn to help me as much as they can and I Honestly appreciate everything they Do!!! Walmart is a good place to work Store#4187
good,"Mostly everyone goes to a Walmart. Working there can be a drag just like anywhere else. Some days are a lot to handle while other days may be super easy but you just deal with the work as it comes. I was a cart associate and the thing I liked the most was I would come in, already know my job and what needed to be done, and they let me work in peace."
good,Walmart is a very fun place to work . It keeps you busy through out your entire shift. The customers are amazing ! Some might have there days which everybody does.
good,"I barely received any hours because of school, but being a cashier was pretty hard in the beginning but it helps you with people skills. You meet different people with different kinds of personalities"
good,"Culture is the foundation of everything we do at Walmart. We define culture as our values in action. It’s how we deliver superior customer service, create a great front-line work environment and improve performance in order to achieve our common purpose of saving people money so they can live better."
good,"A typical day as a cashier. Once you arrive you clock in 5 minutes before and head to the frontend. Go to a CSM to receive orders and do what they ask. Which they will tell you to go to a register or sweep the floor. "
good,"Hard work with some long days. Sometimes it could be an 8 hour day, or a 14 hour day. The pay is good, and it gets better the long you are there......"
good,It's been a great place to work and be able to express yourself and your ideas freely. Really the only downside is the customers that express their displeasure with the company and are unhappy no matter what they are offered to try and help.
good,"Nice place to work though the work loads are a little bit heavy.  Salary  and benefit wise, they pay good for starter and you will get a bit raise every year.  I will definitely recommend to my friends working at walmart."
good,I work full time. I learn something new every day. I follow all of the rules and polices. I like to help people. I like what I do in my job. I work in Cash Office and Electronics.
good,Convivencia sana y amena con los asociados y jefes
good,Walmart was a great company when I worked there. I had more of a home/work balance than I’ve had with any other company. They pay decently and prefer to promote from within.
good,"I think this company has a big heart and tries to do what’s best for its employees  "
good,Might have a few scheduling problems or a couple problems trying to get off for emergencies but other then that it's an okay company to work for. Some of the managers are understanding.
good,"For the job I did (sticking shelves) I was, in my opinion, overpaid. I made almost $12 an hour to work an 8 hour shift that I usually finished in 6. As long as you do your work and dont play around the atmosphere is great. The people you hear complaining about walmart are usually those who are lazy, or have been there a very long time and dont like change. I also promise you, those people who have been there for 10+ years are making close to $18-20 an hour... TO STOCK SHELVES."
good,"Accounting associate. Customer service manager, front desk associate."
good,"Overall my experience at Walmart was decent. I worked all over to be honest. I worked in cosmetics when I was attending high school, they stuck me in pets, paint, hardware, home, cashier, I didn’t think it was to bad because I learned a little bit of everything but it was very hard and tiring. I came back after graduation and I was put in the deli area, the deli had me learn social skills amongst my coworkers and my customers."
good,"The company has changed a lot over the years, some for the best, some not. Walmart has made it much easier to get promoted. Anyone can advance with enough hard work."
good,Helped stock shelves and store products in the produce area and then helped run register and helped in customer service when available helped with cleanup of store and designated areas
good,"Empresa grande porte com grandes oportunidades de crescimento, vivencia e aprendizados constantes com diversas areas."
good,I really enjoyed my job at Walmart. It was stressful at times but worth it in many ways. Walmart offered different jobs opportunities and was very accommodating to customer satisfaction.
good,From the start management was able to make my schedule around my school schedule and my other job. Over time this ended up being my only job because they were able to work with my schedule the best.
good,"This job was very fast paced and fun. Although your working, your team is a second family. Working together helping run the family business is the atmosphere. There is a lot of HR and good support for employees. As well as employee incentives and parties. The nicest thing is the discount and the employee break room with TVs, couches, and a full kitchen with tables."
good,"A cultura do WM foi uma das melhores que trabalhei, pois me proporcionou uma excelente carreira profissional além de trabalhar num ambiente super agradável."
good,Very fast paced and strenuous work.  Hot and dirty environment.  Some managers like to use the fear of loosing a good job to control ppl instead of leading by example and meeting ppl from where they are and take them to where they need to be.
good,The management is spot on. They are amazing to work with. They listen to what you have to say and feel about every situation. Everyone's opinion matters
good,It is a great place to work. Offers great benefits with options of 401k and discounts. It is a very fast paced place to work. I have learned a lot. Great place for advancement.
good,Walmart was an okay job they just had so much going on at times they seemed like they only cared about their product more then the employees but if you need money and don't mind the work its for you
good,"I had a wonderful experience working for Walmart. I would reccomend working for Walmart to friends and family. It was a great learning experience,  and had great advancement opportunities."
good,"Busy store. "
good,"I work in the pharmacy, currently, hours are getting cut and management looks at us as numbers, not people. Otherwise, I love our bonuses and I love my schedule... until the new boss changes it."
good,Love making my customer happy and keeping America rolling. Handling problems and situation the customer has for me. We are a team in the ACC department and we love to serve our customers
good,"People are very helpful and friendly ,managment is very good at listening to what you as a associate has to say and will always get to the bottom of whatever problem you have."
good,"I loved being a cashier. Walmart always offered many ways of being a cashier and or doing customer service. You got to meet so many people that would come through your lane at checkout. As checking some people out, they would have a conversation with me which is why i loved working as a cashier there."
good,"Es una empresa con una gran cultura, te forma en muchos sentidos, a quien sabe aprovechar todo lo que se aprende se le abren las puertas para cualquier área o trabajo..."
good,People were awsome management was great pay was low but still manageable my job was very physical but still was able to enjoy it while being productive
good,Walmart would be great if the managers wouldn't work the truck unloaders like slaves. We were yelled at and belittled for 9 hours every night!!!! Management got really mad at me when I pointed out that where they stored their firelogs was a terrible spot because they could have burned the whole place down!! I got written up for trying to fix thier mistake
good,Company has changed over the years. Too much focus on the bottom line and not enough on the associates needs. Management always too busy to focus time on associates that is needed.
good,"I've really enjoyed working where I do at Wal-Mart, but location is something to look into. If a store in general is not doing well or doesn't hae good managers. It will not be a nice place to work, instead it will be overbearing and stressful."
good,"Learned to scan and organize groceries based on category (meats, boxes, cans, fruits etc.) effectively for customer to unpack. Job built communication skills by making conversation and empathizing with customer,"
good,"Good benefits. As a salary member of management, the work/life benefit did not meet the standards of most companies. The open door policy worked more than the associates knew."
good,"I loved walmart it was just too far, the hours were great, we got a 15 minute break every 2 hours and in my experience there they were very flexible with employees schedules. The managers were a little unorganized."
good,"Fun place to work the people are very friendly and cooperative,  they work as a team to get the job done."
good,"The job isn't hard and continues to help me hone my people skills, even with the most difficult type of people and management. This job has taught me patience is the key to liking your job."
good,"Some staff are nice, the work environment was really nice i just hated doing the same thing everyday. Management is good. Pay is really good and they give you a lot of hours."
good,"It's a great company to work for.Great employment opportunities.Alot of benefits. Teamwork,friendly,fast paced,easy going,works with you on schedules.."
good,"A typical day at work consists of zoning, organizing, the department I'm scheduled for, assisting customers, ensuring shelves are stocked, and everything has its appropriate price tag/shelf label. The work place culture is generally very nice, most associates form decent friendships with each other and it sometimes feels very much like a large, extended family. The hardest part of the job is the physical strain, despite the offered breaks, constantly being on your feet and walking back and forth in straining on the joints, especially in the back and knees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service. having more customers that appreciate your help and voice it makes the occasional unhappy customer that you just cannot please sting a little less."
good,Until you get management it’s kinda hard to get a lot of hours especially overtime. Some management seemed absent from most associates needs but some were very helpful. Plenty of departments to move to around to
good,It's an ok job as long as you have good managers.  Pay is good and job is not difficult.  Customer service is hardest part when you have difficult customers.
good,"A typical day started out with setting up the backroom to get ready to unload the merchandise off of the trucks witch included a minimum of 2 trailers, once that was finished we would pull the product the correct place in the store and we would stock the product"
good,fast paced friendly customer oriented attentive mgmt..average wage..full time was guaranteed 40 hrs per week..I enjoyed working with coworkers.We all worked as a team
good,My experience at Walmart is a OK experience it was a lot of our organize things going on and I like organization but I like the customers my coworkers and the job that I did  stocking Maintenance was good as well I just need a job that I will be happy going into an organized.
good,"Upper management at location was really good and really fair.(with exception of one assisitant manager that was unbearable)  Constraints of management outside of store limited help.  ALWAYS shorthanded, but I like working, not standing around.  Unfortunately, lesser workers rarely dealt with because its hard to hire people."
good,"They're not perfect but they did try, daily/weekly/monthly to recognize exceptional employees. Many managers in diff. departments were cool, nice and others not so much. Like truck freight female manager I heard was a hardass and sometimes didnt allow her employees a 30 min lunch until after working their tails off for 6 or 8 hours!?! That should be illegal by the way."
good,"I started at the bottom in the deli after moving to Payson, within months was department manager.  I became department manager in several departments including produce, meat, deli.  Moving up again to CAP Team and Assistant manager."
good,"I worked as CAP 2 unloading the freight trucks. It was very easy compared to other jobs I have had and it was sometimes enjoyable. Management wasn't bad and the employees were easy to get a long with. Occasionally the managers would throw a luncheon for the employees which was nice. Worked all holidays except Christmas day. Pay is alright if you don't have many bills but definitely not a comfortable living wage."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart for the most part, but I hated collecting carts, I was hired to stock the shelves over night but them made us go outside to collect carts every night."
good,"A typical day at work was moderate not too hard and not too easy. I learned customer service, work pace, merchandising, stocking, leadership, and how to not hate your whole day working. For the most part management was fair. The hardest part was the high expectations. And the most enjoyable was speaking and laughing with coworkers."
good,At Walmart I  do multiple things. I unload trucks and down stack pallets. Work the freight to the shelf and make everything look nice on the shelves. I have great customer experience.
good,"I learned a lot to deal with customer service exoeriences, it was fun, time will go by fast always something new to learn, I enjoyed my time there but the hardest part was there is always people not letting grow. but the most able part of my job was to know so much nice people that let you became a better person"
good,The Titusville Walmart is a nice place to work. Their training process prepared me for my job adequately. Many of my coworkers were friendly and helpful and the supervisors were great at keeping the front end in order.
good,"En lo personal me dieron muchas oportunidades de crecimiento laboral."
good,"Walmart used to be a beacon of light in corporate America. However, in recent years, it has been necessary for the corporation to adopt the more aggressive nature typical of giant corporations. Do not expect to rest on your laurels! You MUST put forth effort to grow personally and professionally to survive. But, if you do, you will be generous rewarded!"
good,Walmart is a good place to work at . It’s more or less for college students or high school students for a stepping stone for the work force. They get you prepared for life situations and on hand task.
good,Fast paced production which turned out to get faster and almost unatainable and dangerous. The company wrote me an accomodation letter for having the fastest production time of all drivers and eventually still got write ups for not making production. I felt to be any faster would be a danger so i left.
good,buen lugar para comenzar carrera laboral en alguna de sus diversas areas
good,While working at Walmart I learned the importance  of being a leader to a company. Managing people in the business is easy being a true leader and having your folks follow you as the enjoyment that I got out of my job. The The hardest part of my job was also the best part of my job and that was being competitive with my peers to be the best leader I could
good,"Learned the meaning of hard work, Typical day wasjust working hard, culture was mostly professional, hardest part was rude customers, most enjoyable was the staff amd learning experience."
good,Definitely a great work place if you’re a hard working person but at the same time too stressful and you have deal with a lot to keep your job. Swallow your pride as a person and work to death.
good,Working at Walmart as a cashier is sometimes stressful because you would have your busy days which would probably be a Sunday after church folks would come in and shop sometimes people have very nasty attitude but other then that it’s a very good job
good,Never a dull day hard working and fast paced you get a break every 2 hours and a lunch for an hour you never expect anything less each day cause something always happens and sometimes you wish it didnt
good,"E uma empresa muito boa de ser trabalhar "
good,"A typical day at work is mainly a busy day at work. It is usually short staffed so it gets stressful but its still fun working with the people I work with. I learned that people are going to be rude to you no matter where you are or who you are. Sometimes I deal with it more than others but it is life. I love some of my managers, they are very professional."
good,You got to work a fast-paced but its really. A good job you meeting new people just be mindful of other people in enjoy yourself ......................
good,"It is a good place to work as part-time for international students"
good,"Scan merchandise in the backroom and stock the sales floor shelves.  Helped get 90% of the backroom emptied."
good,I didn't mine when I first started but we became short staffed and everyone didn't step up some days I felt over worked and under paid for the responsibilities I was given at times I wasn't given the proper tools to succeed I enjoyed my coworkers and the fast pace environment.
good,"It can get stressful, but as long as you keep your head and breathe you can make this place a great career starting point for yourself. The most stressful part in my opinion are different managers telling you to do different things and having to explain that to them in order to get the different tasks prioritized."
good,When i first discovered Walmart i was desperate for a job. As time went on I discovered that the ambianse and the workers is what makes it feel like a second family. You meet different people from different walks on life. i highly recommend this place as anyones starter job.
good,"Scheduling is easy and work life balance is easy to attain. Tasks are easy,"
good,Working in the back is fast paced but good job to have if you don’t really want to deal with customers everyday also the apparel department is a good job to have as well
good,I believe that management needs to be better educated on Walmart policies and procedures. And not allowed to make decisions on they feel rather than whats in the policy.
good,"Great for a first job. Very diverse.  Management is friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of the job is probably the heavy lifting, but that's about it."
good,Alright place to work good hours if you like working with public stocking is best for people who don't want to have a lot of contact with customers climate controlled
good,"Early morning shift 4-1 or 5-2. We offload pallets of merchandise for produce and meat departments unless they have been offloaded previously by the night crew. we break down the pallets scanning and tagging each box or crate and put in the proper bins in the coolers or place on a cart to be stocked to the floor.Bakery and deli trucks come in overnight so they are already to be worked when we arrive. We are also responsible for cleaning the displays and food areas as we stock and rotating date sensitive merchandise to ensure older dates go out first reducing spoilage. Currently the Positions are being re designated so Management is hard to find, However we know what to do and we get it done with little to no supervision. We have a good team. Weekday trucks are the biggest and it takes almost all shift to process the produce portion and the cooler isn't quit big enough when we have specials going on."
good,"The pay is decently high for Cashiers/Cartpushers at ~$11.25 /hr. That pay ranges between job descriptions. They have a diverse community of Associates throughout all the Departments. All of them work very hard to accomplish their tasks for their respective Departments. The infrastructural overhead for our Store was often rigorously demanding, especially for Caps-related Department, Management, Cart-Pushers (in my case at least), and etc. Associates at Walmart must be prepared for the cacophonous activity that awaits them, and be able to work gracefully under pressure."
good,Great experience meeting people from all over the world! A typical day would consist of taking care of customers through the check out line.  Team leaders were always available to assist.
good,"They pay is good for what the job is.  It's a good place to settle down and keep you on your feet.  It can also be enjoyable with good workers by your side.  As long as you are focused on getting the job done, there should never be an issue."
good,Nice friendly and helpful coworkers and managers fun and amazing people  coworkers and customers alike great starting pay very easy to get the hang of things
good,The job is very physical and you will most likely be exhausted at the end of the day. The scheduling is nice because you know the days you have to work and for about how long but you will have to do overtime when they need you to.
good,In the store i used to work there were alot of favoritisim but other than that id a gpod place to work i do recomend people just stay away from the front end to much drama
good,I loved it a lot and wish I was still working for them. Hated hours but no other complaints. Additionally I really like the flexibility to cross train in multiple areas. Overall an amazing job.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was I check in on time and start my shift then I’d go on my 15 minute break, then after my 3rd hour I would go on my lunch break. Finally I’d go on my last 15 minute break an hour before I clock out."
good,"Will work there again great company, swept floors, mopped floors, dust, fold garment buffed floors, made coffee emptied truck unload furniture wiped walls"
good,"Have several health issues, they have been accepting and helpful with needs. I work hard and have proven my honesty. They will give if they see that you are willing to give your best for the company."
good,I worked at when I was in high and it was a real good job my job was unloading trucks and stocking helping customers out and the manager were awesome people and helpful people.
good,I had a very positive experience working at Walmart. Being my first time working their i worked well with my colleagues got along well with my Managers. They were all very good to me during my time their. My best Location out of the three that i worked at was Lanoka Harbor NJ.
good,Walmart was my first job and I liked working there. The pay was good and they always offered overtime. The scheduling was flexible and the mangers were helpful when needed to be.
good,"i have learnt a lot of software like WMS/ SAP."
good,I loved when I worked at Walmart. But I had my reasons why I left the job. The company as a whole is very nice and well put together. Management is overall a good team. Depending on the job position it can be stressful with the co-workers and the work load from time to time.
good,Working at Walmart gives you a lot of benefits and assistance. It’s a very friendly and happy environment and a great starter job. It can also be a great career job for those looking to move up with very many opportunities.
good,I've been working in the electronics area for 3 years now and I like it. Unfortunately I have no means to grow. It's not a bad place to work at if you want extra money.
good,I had a good experience at Walmart loved managing all of the associates. I learned a lot about retail merchandising & Retail sales goals. Base salary for my position was good.
good,"It was the definition of fine. They're pretty lenient on scheduling exceptions if you ask nicely, but management can be a PITA. You will be pulled from your normal department and asked to work elsewhere, then management will be on your behind that work isn't done in your department, so be prepared for that"
good,went in at time said walk sales floor look for end caps and stackbase that could be changed out check on truck to see if unloaders were good and if they need and help to get done at good time
good,"It was a good company "
good,taking things off the truck and loading them onto the floor is not really complicated and the day goes by pretty fast. Everyone was pretty nice and i learned a lot
good,It was good at first. I made alot of friendships and meet some good managers but towards the end of my career I had some bad management and got burnt out because of that reasons.
good,"Working at Walmart I started as a cap2 associate I would separate mixed merchandise and put it where it’s supposed to go, then I would help with the line helping unload the truck."
good,"Walmart was great. It was my college job. The majority of the managers were really nice. Originally I worked about 25-30 hrs, but when the hours and school were too much, they let me work only Sat and Sun. They supported me. Officially, I was a cashier, but I was able to expand and work in other departments like jewelry, layaway, and pharmacy. I really enjoyed being able to do different things."
good,"I felt as though the managers of the place cared deeply for the workers and vise versa. But because of the global enterprise of Walmart, the employees suffered. I loved my time here but I always felt the mood of the place was depressing"
good,"Good pay hard work, but your just a number and will be reminded almost everyday how disposable you are to the company. Managers act as if they don't need employees to further their goals or receive their bonuses"
good,Excelente empresa para adquirir mayores habilidades de soft y hard.
good,Was a decent job management did all they could to help you if you needed it. Most stressful thing about working at walmart is all of associates that dislike their job and try to drag other workers down.
good,At Walmart it is a growing business that wants you to he high paced and to excel. They do train for the most part. Beneifts are the best part. Work life balance is a joke
good,"It’s a okay place to work, it really depends on the managers moods. It could be a good day or a bad day. But managers don’t understand there attitude effects everyone else’s attitude"
good,OGP is a wonderful job. Work no later than eight o’clock. Sometimes it’s tiring but it is fun and very competitive. Great job. Would definitely go back.
good,I liked working there I was a full time employee but they got where they wanted to cut my hours idk y I worked hard the management was ok but sometimes treated people poorly
good,Walmart is a good place to work but it is hard to advance and pay raises are minimal Management at my store was friendly but sometimes took a long time to help with difficult customers.
good,i learn alot working at walmart i learn how to market different product for different season . i learn to work the register and provide great customer service.
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers and the public. I keep my area clean and organized. I have customers who seek me out. I love my customers and coworkers.
good,The company does not like you changing work hours when you said you could do them earlier. The pay may be low even for  a supervisor but the job it self was rewarding.
good,As a first job it is better then most. But if your other then full time the hours can be unpredictable . You will do more then what your job entitles you to do. Pay starts out at 10 which is more then most places.
good,I worked for Walmart for almost 7 years and was afforded many opportunities but when Walmart makes changes they do it without thought in the process and considers the obstacles involved with the moves. They proceed with the apparent goal of just cutting wages overall
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart when I worked there. Everyone was like one big family. I worked there for several years and the management team were always very good to me.
good,Pays higher than anything else without a college degree . Will try to help work with you on hours . Gain decent PTO after around 5 years with the company .
good,It’s a good job for someone who doesn’t have a life kind of. It’s very demanding. I get 30-36 hours a week and I’m still in school. Not the most ideal job for someone that has other things to do.
good,"Um otimo local de trabalho em equipe."
good,"I would be excited some days to come into work, i enjoyed working here with friends and friendly people, management was always on point about how people did there job, security was always on point with catching the criminals, i liked meeting new customers and people"
good,"Helping customers."
good,Working for Walmart is alright for the most part. It can be very high paced depending on what department you work in. In my experience I was without a manager for a while so if you have a problem you kinda have to figure out a solution by yourself.
good,Being a personal shopper was very physical work because the groceries were heavy. When the store got busy dealing with customers came into play a lot. Management sometimes had unrealistic expectations but the working environment wasn't bad. I think that this department should be more selective of the people that they hire. Everyone that is hired should be able to complete the job quickly and without much help.
good,"It was a good place to work at, but there were no job advancement opportunities and the pay was way too low. This would have been a good place for me due to the fast pace nature of the job but the pay was too low."
good,Walmart was awesome. They are very organized and have nice schedules. Its hard to get time off tho. It can be very fast paced and stressful but there are always people close by to help.
good,great place to work. It is a really fast paced environment and you can see lots of people with years of experience any you can learn a lots from them. it helps me a lots of develop myself and to achieve my goals.
good,I would say Walmart remodeling went alright and the employees sometimes catches attitude but other than that it alright the management is always hard to find
good,"Keeping busy is a good thing, lots to do made my days fly by, great co workers, a little above minimum wage pay, full time hours, nice customers mostly, easy work but very busy, so constantly moving does get you tired, over all good place to work, loved my job, however my availability changed"
good,Excellent place to work.  Stressful but good work life balance. They have polices around relocation that should be amended to help an employee get closer to home.
good,Is a reliable job and the company gives opportunity for career growth. They also give great bonuses every now and then and is a perfect flexible job if you’re doing college or just want to work a part time
good,What I've learned from working here was how organize things in a timely fashion. Management helped when it was needed. The hardest part of the job was making sure the products weren't placed in the wrong spot. The most enjoyable parts were talking with the other associates.
good,I had a great experience when I first started. But as the months went by there were bitter feuds. I learned who to associate with and who not to. It was easy hard work.
good,This is a good job . Flexibility is everything . Managers are understandable and will work with you . Sometimes things may seem a little unfair but that’s every job.  But a great pay rate as week
good,There is several departments and positions through out the warehouse. Over all it is a fast pace job and you have to able to finish your job in designated time frames. There is opportunity to move throughout the warehouse. It is a good workplace culture. Many good people out there you can bond with.
good,"I was lucky to be able to work at Walmart and advanced rather quickly to a supervisor position. After working on the front end for about 18 months, I interviewed for and was offered a department manager position on the salesfloor."
good,"Walmart is a great store to work at for students, because the are really flexible with the schedule. Also liked that the my co workers where really friendly and willing to help and teach the new employees how to get things done more fast and easier."
good,Its a fast lerning work inviernment team member are realy nice an cool to work with l like the chalenge they gave me to time miself an try an be faster then i realy was .
good,"Great place to get good work experience in retail. You learn great customer services skills, learn how to interact with people. Lot of coworker are very friendly and are willing to help you learn how to do your job better."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you go to a neighborhood market. Super-centers are everybody for themselves and the only thing that matter are sales. Transferred to a neighborhood market and a month later got promoted to manager. So far it’s been great!
good,"In the distribution center i work, the goal production numbers were set quite, which meant you had to move very quickly. The work was sometimes very strenuous, but the pay and benefits were worth it in my opinion."
good,"A typical day at work was mostly overwhelming. I learned a lot about the importance of merchandising, price accuracy and inventory. Management for the most part left questions, concerns, and issues unanswered. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the holiday increase in merchandise, help was rarely given to accomplish daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,If you are a single young person with ambitions to move up I recommend the job. It’s not for everyone. And holidays away from your family suck but the discounts and benefits help somewhat
good,"WalMart offers very good to excellent food and household wares at very competitive prices."
good,"Love the job , great people to work for great amosphore . Was a great opportunity there for advancement as great training in the videos as well as great work with your home schedule."
good,Loved working her the management is awesome and willing to work with your schedule. Customers are friendly. Over all great place to work. Wal Mart has great incentives for employees.
good,Good job. Fairly easy to learn. Nice co-workers. They show you how to use the trash compactor and the paper jack. I guess hardest part about the job was the night shift.
good,working at Walmart was all right was not the worst but wasnt the best. my section of the store was understaffed so had quite a bit of overtime and long stressful shifts but those were not often. I wold work there again if i had to but i would not go back to my specific section i used to work at.
good,"I worked there during the coldest part of the year so it was kinda rough at first, but it got better eventually after i got used to doing my job."
good,"Work in ambiguous environment to identify cost saving in the domestic supply chain. Freedom to work with whatever tools you want, but challenged to find meaningful impacts."
good,"The interview and hiring process was easy. I really enjoyed the job at first, and I was able to take a leave of absence for college. My job was still secure when I came back, however the new manager gave me a hard time and it almost felt personal for whatever reason."
good,"As long as you go to work and do your job, everything works out, some management was unfair, and played favoritism in my experience when I worked there, but those managers are no longer there."
good,It’s a pretty enjoyable job not much to complain about it’s especially good for an entry level job management is alright it’s a little hard to get their attention any time it’s busy
good,Once you find the right store location and position that suites you walmart can be a good place to work.  The employees need to be/think team players.  All of that steams from the store manager.  The store I recently worked at was not a team player oriented.  That made it a difficult place to work.
good,"Processing between 100 to 200 invoices daily- fast pace environment"
good,Very cool place to work. The atmosphere was really awesome. It only not felt like a work place but more like a family where people has some much respect for the individual.
good,"This is a place where you feel at home. You become like family with your coworkers and you can always depends on each other. The pay is competitive with other retail jobs, and if you work hard advancements are possible fairly quickly. The only thing is with company changes, jobs are given and taken away. You could get a managers position and 6 months later they do away with your position."
good,"A typical day at work would be busy,loud and crowded sometimes. What I learned in my work area is how costumers want a certain food product, "
good,"supportive and encouraged to skill build, very caring employees all focused on customer care, and helping each other provide best possible service and assist where ever needed"
good,Management takes note of your work ethic and helps you advance if you want to. Coworkers are great to be around. Training is supervised and you can always ask for more help if you need it.
good,"Co-workers were very helpful and friendly, a typical day usually went by fast if you get productive. I learnt how to handle cash registers and customer service techniques, and overall it was very enjoyable."
good,"A typical day as a Cashier at Walmart is very stressful. You have to add up people's orders and some of the people are young, old, all ages.  And a lot of them were very rude, pushy, and just not really nice. Hours were horrible I started there part time and they were giving me full time."
good,I did a lot for Walmart and they did a lot for me. If was fun to be there and if i was given the change to work there again i would do it in a second. The Management that did help I will forever be in there debt.
good,"I had a great time when I was with Walmart. The cart Attendant was the easiest job I’ve had, I do miss it but management wasn’t the greatest at the time and they were working on getting better. The people I worked with were excellent. The pay was fair. I always got over 40 hours like I wanted while still in school and will work around your schedule."
good,"I think the best part of my job is the relationship you develop with the customers.  You don't just provide them with prescriptions, you also get to know them as a person, and become an important part of their pharmacy experience."
good,"les gérant ont une belle compréhension, également toujours ouvert a modifier l'horaire d'un employés lors d'imprévue"
good,"I really enjoy OGP. It can be stressful at times if your team gets behind, but overall it's a fun, fast-paced environment. It's usually not boring in our department... And it's very physical (walking, occasionally heavy lifting)... So you get your exercise in! Being a cashier was alright, but quite mundane, and the overall morale was low of our cashiers. I love the close-ness of Walmart associates; we really are like a big family here."
good,management is very helpful and willing to work with any situation as long as you are clear with your intentions and truthful with your actions. I would recommend this work place to anyone.
good,It's all about happiness & fun. very good package and a good place to work. It gives you time and make your to plan yourself in other area of development.
good,"Un día normal en Walmart pues como todo trabajar bajo presión, pero al final de la jornada te quedas con muchos aprendizajes, mi estancia laboral en la empresa fue reconfortante de mucho aprendizaje en diferentes áreas de trabajo, obtuve mucha experiencia como persona y como empleado."
good,"I worked most of my time in the bakery at Walmart and I enjoyed it. I was a cake decorator and still to this day was the best job I've had. I loved getting to be creative. The management could have been better, they spent a lot of time in the backroom and not enough time helping associates learn or guide them."
good,"The job was fine, you will feel appreciated for your hard work. The company does take care of they staff as well. I work in the produce section with a great team behind."
good,Pra mim foi bom trabalho com eles foi o meu primeiro emprego fiz muitas amizades deixei muitos amigos lá.
good,I love Walmart. Theft was/is still a major problem there. Management was going thru major changes. I loved my job. I could not understand that they switched from human schedule makers to an electronic scheduler.
good,Work at walmart as a ap host been at walmart for 3 years i as well do house cl on the side i am as well. Work with customers and have customers service for a long time
good,"productive and steady workplace very clean enviroment have nice schedule acceptable going to work .Management always helpful with questions and directions .Occassionally have congradulatory parties and barbeque.Like to make you feel part of the ""family"".Very hectic around inventory and holidays but very organized in their planning"
good,if Walmart would have had better management it would've ran smoother but with the management they have now it was impossible to do everything they asked for.
good,A real nice place to work.  Able to keep busy with customers and employees. Learning new skills was both fun and easy. Pretty good benefits with 401k and stock options.
good,"Enjoy my co workers.Respect my co workers. Dont always agree with them. "
good,As long as you go to work and do your job then you'll be fine. Do not get mixed up in gossip or other people's mess. That's the quickest way to get caught up and lose your job. I've seen it happen numerous times.
good,I'd recommend the job to anybody if they wanted to work there. But to be able to work there you need to be fast pace and willing to work every day with an open availability.
good,"I loved working at walmart, meeting all the people, joking, and laughing with most. I had two jobs, had to choose. Had to take higher pay. I left without notice without thinking. Would love to go back with better pay."
good,This job was easy but fast past when it came to stocking. Third shift at the time was wonderful. I loved getting paid every two weeks. Managers was understanding also.
good,Had a good experience working for Walmart management and the whole staff are professional and very friendly I learned how to unload trucks and stock shelves accordingly
good,Its was my first ever job and its a great one . I was a stocker and really didn’t have a trouble completing the task .  The pay was ok and the mangers work well with your hours of work .
good,If you are a quick thinker and outgoing can work under stress them Wal-Mart will be a good job.. I've been with the company for 13 years and have reached levels I never thought I would
good,"I enjoyed it, Everyone was nice and I liked the work pace. Not much more to really say about the place. I left because I decided to go back to school. Pay was low but it was okay amount."
good,Good place nice people. Earn time off by coming to work as scheduled. The hardest part is advancing in company. The pay is not best for what you do. People for the most part good
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, I was able to learn a lot of new things and move around the entire store to get a feel of every department. I would recommend working at Walmart."
good,"Working at Walmart was stressful at times because of other employees not getting their work done so I had to pick up the slack, but other than that it was a pretty good place to work."
good,"Demanding job where I was expected to do my job and others. People get promoted based on friendships and not allowed relationships. "
good,Walmart was interesting experience. Management was not great but they wasn't bad either. I enjoyed the environment but I would wish for a better management staff
good,"Loved working with the people I worked with (most days). The management was a bit flakey and lacked the want to help out their underlings. Work was easy, when everyone was pulling their own weight."
good,I really liked working at Walmart. My co-worker was wonderful and we worked as a team. My overall experience was great place to work if you need flexible hours and plenty of opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"En general es bueno y no rutinario.El problema y lo que hay que considerar es la paga que es muy baja,no es pareja para todos,los aumentos,aguinaldo y utilidades son de lo peor,no hay mucho crecimiento y entre mas aprendes mas te explotan y no te suben el sueldo a menos qe les sea necesario."
good,It isn't a bad place to work but the insurance benefits I think could be much better. There is always something to do. For the most part everyone pulls their own  weight.
good,"I operate the cash register, greet the customer, bag their items. "
good,"Wal-Mart is a great first job and has a wide variety of jobs within the work place, making it easy to advance within the company. This corporation has a plethora of benefits for all age groups and gives employees new skill building techniques for their job and others as well."
good,"I moved up quickly and enjoyed my job. worked part time..then went to overnighta. got $1 more per hour. then got csm,  then support manager etc. I enjoyed working there. and getting insurance which wasn't that expensive was great."
good,Hours can be long but are paid well. Management can be a bit stubborn about giving employees a full 40hrs per week. But as long as you have a good team and clear procedures it's pretty good.
good,It’s not a bad place to start working. I enjoy working with this company. They are good about working around ur availability. A lot of changes over the years.
good,"great job for young persons looking for entry level job into the workforce."
good,I enjoyed my time working there. Got to meet new people and great management. My job tasks were not too much to handle. I got to learn alot about managing my time in the workplace.
good,"very flexible hours if you're a student. you can switch shifts with coworkers when you need. opportunities for extra money if you're good at offering master cards. you can also pick up extra shifts if you need more hours. however, it can be stressful working as cashier."
good,Working at Walmart was fun and easy most of the time.  The management helped when ever they where needed and helped you understand when something went wrong.  I learned proper customer service and how to work with co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was weekends when the store was packed and there was know down time.  The best part of the job was when you got to help the managers off the register.  It gave you a brake and a chance to do something else and learn more about the store.
good,Walmart is very fast pace depending on your job title id say. At the end of the day though the co workers are the best and always there to help if needed
good,"Walmart is a great place to start one’s working career, however it is not the place to spend an entire career. It provides me with a good experience and it is something I am greatfull for."
good,Each walmart is different and each comes with its own challanges. The work loads are not complicated and will make your work day go by fast.and it may take time to get higher position but there are alot of opportunities
good,"Good pay. Great coworker. Kind of stressful but if you know what you are doing it gets easier. All kinds of good benefits including discount, 401k, PTO, and health insurance."
good,Co workers were great people & very helpful if you had trouble with something. The managers were very understanding about me barely learning the job & teaching me as much as they could.
good,"I learned better customer service skills, money services, and work related tasks. The management team were very helpful. Co workers had a positive attitude. I loved helping customers and co workers."
good,"Good place to work good equipment and staff never pushed to to do anything you don't feel comfortable doing. "
good,Great place to work for the most part. This specific location seems to have more of a close family vibe than previous Wal-Mart I have worked at. Have really enjoyed these last few years in Jerome.
good,"I absolutely loved my job as a customer service manager! I adored each of my cashiers. Everyday it would either be a really good day, or just a really horrible day. I always strived for it to be very positive and hoped for the best. My favorite part was seeing my cashiers and seeing them happy everyday. My goal was always to see them succeed and move up in the company"
good,It's a fine company to work for. I have enjoyed my time with the company. While I admit it's not the family company it use to be. But the people you work with can make up for it
good,"liderança participativa, feedback e acompanhamentos"
good,"It was a good job with good pay!! Depending on where you live, it’s hard to find someone who pays $11 an hour! I was told electronics gets paid a couple cents more then a cashier does! In order to change your availability you have to fill out a paper and submit into a box before 3 weeks prior to when you actually need your schedule to change ! Which was annoying because the hiring people don’t always look at them til the last minute!!!I was a cashier and after a while of working there it got tiring of having to stay in the same place and not being able to do anything else. You have to wait 6 months to move to any other position, so pick wisely! You have to also wait 3 months to get your employees discount that is 10% which isn’t much! It only benefits you if you spend a 100 or more on something other then food! It doesn’t make sense to me why it doesn’t take as much money off from food but it doesnt, maybe just a couple of cents! But You have 5 points that are taken away if you call in or late. After 5 points they will fire you! But the good thing is , they give you 9mins before you are “considered” late! & now you can use your paid sick days that is given to everyone no matter when you were hired! But overall it was a really good job!"
good,Spent a lot of time spreading dirt around more than cleaning it up from faulty equipment.  Pay was decent and bosses reasonable.  Just didn't feel like I was being much use to the world. Great job if all you want is a paycheck. If you want to work keep looking
good,"When looking into a management position at Walmart, the biggest thing to remember is that it is constantly changing.  With new innovations you are consistently having to adapt to new tools. The work/life balance can be difficult at high traffic times such as holidays and inventory. Remember that it is retail and busy times are evening and weekends."
good,"This is from experience at the Walmart Head Office in Mississauga. There is a decent culture at the head office. Supportive co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job. There are bi-weekly events to update staff and clear communication across the company. Many other events also took place for employee appreciation. "
good,I learned a lot from Walmart. Working fast paced and in different areas. I definitely am grateful for the experience. It shaped me a little more to the worker I am today.
good,"I started as a overnight stocker in 2015 and it was nice, peaceful and excited. The managers than were great and was available if you had any concerns, questions or needed help. i moved my way up in 2018 as a Dependent Manager and was very excited in doing and learning more about the store, the business and the process of price changes,inventory,team work,and store sales and products."
good,Overall it was a very good experience. And a great place for a job. They’re very understanding when it comes to scheduling and everyone that works there makes a great team
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for. There is always room for growth . And, There is a job for everyone.... rather its cleaning, deli, grocery, produce, merchandise,Fitting room, cashier, personal shopper etc. I absolutley love working for walmart!"
good,More opportunities and opportunities for advancement on my behalf. Otherwise a great company. Great experience with associates an fun to work with.  I enjoy the customers.
good,"Working for Walmart is a great way to gain job experience for someone looking to break into the work force. The benefits and bonuses are actually quite generous. However in my case in particular, the management team on the lower levels were arguably not qualified enough to successfully lead a team. Overall the company was a great start for myself and many others, though the personal experience was less than satisfactory."
good,I been with Walmart for 19 years but I would love to seek other opportunities to learn something new  and enjoy a brand new environment  and Walmart is a good employer and would recommend them to anyone I just want to branch out to other jobs
good,"Ótima empresa para trabalhar."
good,I enjoyed working there however do to medical issues I had to leave. I had a stint where while workinh there was taken to er 3x in 3 weeks. First time spine pulled completely straight (didn't even have my natural curve in my spine) got placed on weight restriction because it was not injury on job they couldn't follow that. 2nd visit ruptured cyst on my ovary. 3rd visit found out I was pregnant placed on bed rest.
good,This was a very fast paced job. We had alot of food to prepare each shift. Upkeep of hot and cold food. We sliced meat and cheese. Lots of cleaning responsibilitys. Learned Major concept of team work and making sure to always provide good customer service.
good,"Working at walmart is pretty chill most of the time. The days can feel short or they can feel long just depending on what you're doing that day. The people I work with are cool, but it's a shame to see some of them leave due to hour cuts. Managment is hit or miss, some of them act like they're gods amongst men and treat  poorly but a good majority of managment are cool people and understanding."
good,"If you are a hard worker and care about doing a good job, you can thrive at Walmart.  If you're only looking to skate by and collect your paycheck then Walmart is not for you.  If you truly care about customers and their satisfaction, I would encourage anyone to apply."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to get experience in the grocery industry.  there are a lot of different types of jobs to do"
good,"I don't really think there's much of note to mention about the job.  You show up, do your job, and leave when your shift is over.  Sometimes management likes to ask people to come in early or stay late, but their strict policy about ""no overtime"" means they expect you to clock out early, or come in late, on subsequent days in order to avoid getting any overtime.  I tried to avoid this game of schedule dancing and just stuck to when I was supposed to clock in, and left when I was supposed to leave, work be damned."
good,People are great and help out when they can. The job is super fast paced but the help makes up for it. Wal mart cares for their associates and want you to succeed
good,"Pay is good, un organized. Its busy depending on what department you in. Deli if they short on staff, its up to you add whoever to get everything done. They act like they Care but they don't, longs as its running and get done. They don't send no help when its two people running the deli"
good,Walmart is a booming and busy workplace depending on the time of year. Work is relatively simple and you always more than likely have something go do during your scheduled work shift
good,"Steady hours, easy work. Lack of training caused a few issues. Enjoyed my time there, but decided to go back to previous employer after lack of support by a manager."
good,good work place with good people and great team and great management. littte bit stressfull and demanding but its all good workplace  and time management
good,"Cashier handled cash transaction, credit cards, Canadian currency, WIC vouchers, etc.  Customer service, cleaned and straightened work area, bagged groceries."
good,Being an associate at Walmart gave me more experience in retail that I already had on-top of that learning to how to manage your time correctly in order to complete the daily tasks.
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. You get a discount on your merchandise and insurance is okay. It can get very busy and stressful and always is very  competitive.
good,"I learned almost every position there besides management and csm. I usually was doing everything but the position I was hired for most of the time,but that was a good thing because I learned a lot. Also managers took a liking to me and I became someone reliable to get things done which opened up more opportunities for myself. Though most of the time they had scheduling problems where there wasn't enough coverage in the store which put a heavy burden on one or two associates to handle multiple departments at a time. This was the hardest part of this job and it caused havoc with customers, staff, and management. The best part of this job is your relationships you form with other associates."
good,"Great place to work, but management will want everything as perfect as possible before you leave the floor. The job really is steady paced. Everyone shops at walmart."
good,to be fair Walmart now pays better than when I worked there. But over I enjoyed my time at Walmart and only left to go to work as a diesel mechanic which is what I went to school for.
good,"I worked for Walmart for 7 years. First as a deli associate then I was promoted to deli manager. I got to know my customers and associates over the years and enjoyed my job. When I moved to personnel, I really found my passion. I loved working with new associates. I loved teaching and leading them into the company. My managers were always good to me and treated me with respect."
good,"I would recommend Walmart to others. Great for experience, & learning different aspects of retail.  They are not ""perfect"", but The staff are helpful."
good,Do not care to provide a review of the company I am currently employed by.  Company appears to be under a restructuring process.  I continue adding to this and it continues to reject it due to not enough characters.
good,Great team player and problem solving. I I am always willing to train my employee and reassure that employee understand the project that is given to him or her.  As Dept manager I am always willing to help were that I am need.
good,"Working at walmart was a great experience,as walmart associate you are always very busy,at work. never time too be bored the benefits was good ,the wages was okay,as cost of living rises,pay wages could have increases."
good,"For the two years I worked as a produce associate I felt like I was apart of a family."
good,"On an average day I would come in walk receiving then walk the store take notes, Ha a management meeting at 8am. Go to receiving see what was left to be taken care of before setting up to unload the next shipment. I would get with Department Managers on their duties for the day because everyday changed. I helped to ensure restrooms, offices and the break room was clean. I helped run the frontend when it was busy. I had to help ensure deposits where ready for pickup. The hardest part was working receiving ensuring nothing was on the floor and through holidays, My most favorite part was interacting with the customers and fellow employees."
good,People are friendly to work with.The job is physically demanding. Job duties include stocking shelfs scanning bins in the back. Help customers get what they need.
good,"It was a very interesting job . You meet new people everyday . You also get paid very well. The Managers were nice people , you get a very nice store discount."
good,Great place to work. Amazing benefits and room to grow. Just keep in mind they are constantly changing and evolving to meet the ever changing needs of the customer.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Wal-Mart and would love to return. I worked alongside some great people who continue to help the company strive. I wish all employees, including those in management, could work more productively with the sales associates and cashiers."
good,"I worked at a great store with great management. I’ve heard a lot of stores treat their employees unfairly but mine did not. Christmas time has a lot of extra hours but the paycheck is nice and you are not forced to work overtime, but it helps with all the stock that comes in. Most of the year its a standard7-4 shift butI hear they are doing away with that."
good,GBS walmart is a good place to work. In order to make it through the average work day you must be able to adapt to change. Walmart is reorganizing and doing a big layoff but if they have any positions available that you are interested in i would say go for it. The pay is pretty descent.
good,"I like working with most of the employees and customers. Part-time employees can't rely on their hours, Walmart gives annual raises and meals for meeting their goals."
good,Friendly environment they may ask you to do different duties than what u were hired for not to hard to do management is good at least when I was there been a while since I worked there only left cause I had to relocate if not I would probably still be there so definitely worth a go
good,"Its not too fast or slow at Walmart. Easy to get used to, making it a good work environment for people who enjoy little to no stress. Only bad part is its hard to get a proper full-time job there."
good,Walmart has its ups and downs but the most enjoyable part is that the team environment and the success that brings to your department. The hardest parts is dealing with management.
good,"Walmart, retail, is not for everyone. But I have very few regrets from my 26 years with the company. I had multiple opportunities for change and/or advancement. I got along well with management and felt their support in my endeavors. Even though I am leaving the company I can still recommend it."
good,Walmart is an ok job and if given a chance I would return. Management may seem strick at first but it just takes some  time to adjust to things. Overall it's like a home away from home.
good,The associates are trained in their particular areas. They are given access to read the requirements online. I enjoyed working for the company because of customer service.
good,Walmart is a fast paced environment that is customer and sales oriented. Work hard and advancement is very possible. Enjoyed working there. Good organization that cares for the environment and for recycling and re-purposing materials it uses.
good,"Es una empresa interesante para el desarrollo personal."
good,"Because there is alot of work to do each day, the shift goes by quickly. From the time you get to work until the end of your shift, you stay extremely busy. With the proper time management you can finish all tasks"
good,"The job it's self was alright. I enjoyed getting up everyday and going to work. I however didnt enjoy the poor communication skills my 3 bosses had, everyone of them fighting for power. It made it very hard to do your job correctly, when no one knew how to do the job."
good,"You will learn a lot of IT Microsoft suite, speak with associates all around the world, develope your skills working hard to help the business keep running and improving."
good,I have worked for Walmart for over 10 years and have experienced all aspects of the business. Starting as a cashier and climbing up the chain to a Co Manager. It is definitely regarding but will take a toll on you and your home/life balance.
good,Mucho crecimiento para los asociados prestaciones buenas en algunos formatos de empresa
good,as long as you pace yourself wal-mart is a very easy and relaxed work place. i had no problem unloading pallets and properly placing them on the shelf's while organizing them .
good,"Walmart's goals/ethics are superior. You learn a substantial amount of experience. They provide ongoing computer training, hands-on, and travel-to training classes. Further education for GED, business degrees, and learning other languages are encouraged and in most cases offered for free or $1/day through online courses for associates. Climbing the ladder is not easy. It took me 4 years to receive an opportunity for a managerial promotion. Walmart is definitely a great place to start. It's also great for people who need a part-time job for a little extra cash."
good,Well rounded shopping center that enables one or more to learn various skills to carry beyond the workplace. There are different departments so the company upholds a high level of potential to customers and employees to enjoy a open environment.
good,"My only cons working there were, annoying/rude customers, and the store manager was condescending. The job duties are not too difficult. Repetitive if anything. Attendance is a major concern to them so be cautious when missing a day. All in all, I'd say definitely give it a try. To be honest, probably one of the most enjoyable jobs I've worked."
good,If they give you more hours it would’ve been a good job but they want to give you like 30 hours nobody’s really getting over 40 photos managements OK not That great
good,Growing company with good benefits.  Meet people and feel good at the end of the day that you have helped others.  Work schedule changes makes is difficult sometimes to adapt.
good,"Love working for walmart, was in a manager position for 13 years while working there. Love interacting with new people on a daily basics. Adaptability plays a major part in being sucessful working there."
good,"Productive in the Work place just bad Management. Due to harassment from Management I was put into unhealthy Mental state, which caused me to leave Work before my 2 Weeks were up, making me be put under ""Company Abandonment."""
good,"work with good associates, that is very compassionate, and know their job well, management is very knowledable about products and handles customers very professionalbe"
good,It's ok just a standard job regular nine to five your kept busy helping co workers when you have the time or your job calls for there's a steady amount of tasks for you to do if your a janitor like me keeps you busy
good,Great place to work but don't like hiring full time. 3rd shift is a little less customer oriented and more work. If you like talking to people I'd suggest working days.
good,Enjoy working there but there is no home workplace balance. I am a fresh assistant manager . I thrive on team building and taking care of the customers.
good,"backroom and truck unloading can be both physically and mentally exhausting, labor is rough and time crunches can cause mental stress when you are being constantly pushed to work past your limits by both supervisors and managers to unload and push out merchandise."
good,"I had an amazing experience working at Wal-Mart, with my crew composed of really great people, hard-workers, and people who would strive to get everything done and help others. Only job I've ever willingly went to without any remorse or unwanting to attend. "
good,Good place to work. I love my job and the people. You can advance quickly in the company. Less than one year of being there i got a promotion. Then another on 2 yrs after that.
good,"easiest job to do, the staff there are pretty much separated in groups, so find your group and you'll be good. hours are great , always opportunities  to get promoted. Interactions with customers helps a lot inside and outside of work."
good,"I love this job and the reason I am leaving is to get a job closer to my school. Most of the CSM's are good, however there are a few that can not multitask or preform their job well"
good,"Walmart has been a great place to work, i have enjoyed many interactions with customers and building relationships. I have learned to be a good supervisor, and that if you take care of your people they will take care of you. My management team was good, especially my newest manager he has been so involved and such a good support system."
good,I was presented with opportunities to advance fairly quickly.  If you work hard and start to anticipate what management wants you will have an easy time. The managers were hit or miss but I was glad to have gotten a good one who would recognize effort.  I didn't mind the customers too much.  There were only a few that were over the top in the time that I was there and most wanted upper management to come and deal with them anyway.  I wish that there was more training in some areas.  I felt like I was thrown in to things a lot that I was expected to either sink or swim.
good,pretty easy most of the time. got back problems so sometimes it caused an issue but otherwise was able work thru the day. best part of working there for me was being able to keep to myself and focus on my work. sometimes are job were to big to tackle in one shift so some things didnt get done on time but wasnt due to lack of trying
good,I had a good manager starting out and than there was one who was just really rude all the time to customers and staff. She left eventually so I went back to my old job and had the best manager there is.
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work, the only issue I really had was the fact I was all over the place with my schedule. Evenings one day getting out at 11pm and back in at 7am. With kids it gets a little tiring."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you don't mind change. A majority of the employees are very friendly. My main complaint is that some of the management seem to care less about the work environment
good,The pay and the hours are great if you're looking for full time. The fact that they do not accept doctors notes for absences sucks and some of the employees are not the nicest.
good,I have worked for Wal-Mart for several years and it's a good job for people in my part of the country where not many jobs are available. Young people have many opportunities to advance and make a decent pay.  I don't like that new people come in and make the same amount of money that I do after being there for several years.   I feel it's not fair.  I work in the back room ..procesapparel greight
good,"A typical work day would run smoothly if you are on top of your game,  although occasionally you can get behind. I've learned to put my best effort into a project and if I fall short there's always someone to help you weather it be a coworker or member of management, we're all there to accomplish the same goals.The hardest part of my job would be not meeting my own expectations in a givin day. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i made my customers happy by helping them to their satisfactory."
good,"Everyone was very welcoming the first time around after applying, it was a great place to work and it really helped with bettering customer service skills."
good,It was a good job to work they don’t expect too much from you. The only problem was they wouldn’t let me move departments around the store or advance really.
good,"Fun place to work, definitely a great entry level position. Management is very eager and happy to help you with anything you need and very flexible with your schedule (so perfect for students ). This job makes you resilient, like if you can handle Wal-Mart customers, you can handle anything."
good,I was a cashier at Walmart... at times it could be stressful but it was a great job with exceptional management. The pay could be better and I was a little bummed out when they went up $1 AFTER I left for maternity leave. Another thing I was working there pregnant and I was not allowed to sit down to check customers out BUT after I had my baby I visited the store and I saw other women who were pregnant at the time I was employed there and guess what?? THEY WERE SITTING!!!! I thought that was pretty unfair.
good,Working as a cap 2 associate was great! You unloaded the truck and stocked the shelves in the store. It was a fun place to work at as a highschool student but they can begin to have schedule issues for school.
good,Busy work flow great customers family like work situation. Great opportunitys for advancement within the company good benefits great retail experience
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart "
good,Co-workers and the team made it a great place to work along with great hours in certain seasons.
good,"Started working with the company in the state of Rhode Island and iwhere I met great employees and customers and then I transfered to New Port Richey, FL back in 2004. At my new store in New Port Richey it was like a little challenge for me at first because this was a Walmart Supercenter, a huge store and working overnight tor my next 9plus years with the company. I had a lot of success with the management team and co-workers. Switched back to days to work at the Lube and Tires section and less than a year later in had my promotion as a Department Manager."
good,"Great job and pay , would enjoy job in the past if I had better management . Learned a lot about sticking majority of the store . Good job to refer and great benefits"
good,The job wasnt to bad but the managment has lot of issues to work out there i really dont recomend anyone work there if you do choose to work there just watch your back with the managers.
good,"Love meeting new people, interacting with customers, job security and advancement, flexible schedules, diverse coworkers, plenty of experience, it is an ok place to work."
good,"Loved working here, most of the people are great to work with, but management needs to be worked on. Some were overly strict and expected everything to be done exactly how they wanted even if it was implausible, while others were too lax and didn't really seem to care about the functions and operations going on."
good,It’s a really really good job unless you run afoul of personal politics -  you can go from hero to zero in a minute.   If you get in the right store in the right situation it is an absolutely professional company and a very good job to have.   The company is always changing with the times which was excellent it’s just unfortunate that not all leaders are professional
good,When you get there in the morning or afternoon everybody greets you  and you clock in and get your assignments for the day. If you have any questions about your assignments you ask one of your coworkers for help and get the job done as soon as possible.
good,Overnight maintenance at Walmart was fun. The only times the job was overwhelming was due to not having enough of us to clean in and out of the store especially on the weekends when it was extremely busy.
good,"Typical day at work help customers solve associates and customer problems. Help management with daily task and projects. A great place to work teaching and training associates, learning new things and people is  amazing."
good,"Overall I really did enjoy the Walmart I worked at, we really were a strong team of people on overnights. Somehow we felt like a really strange family, I will miss them."
good,"Great people, fast paced environment, excellent pay and benefits once you reach the 90 day mark (I didn't). Yea, I just miss the people and the environment."
good,It really depends on Some stores was better then others. Some people and some management are difficult to get along with. Some stores are great to work at and some aren’t. That’s just my personal opinion.
good,"Worked there while I was in high school to start saving up some money. It did the job, good hours and decent pay. The managment was not the best and this was a popular opinion there."
good,Management needs work. Co-workers were fun to work with. Always something to do. Management does not listen to associates' opinions sometimes. Too much is asked.
good,"Lot of fun activities"
good,"i started as a cashier after 6 months i worked i deli department and after 6 months i transfer to food associate department now i am work as food associate , i deal with efferent tip of food like cheese, milk, butter, meat, hot dogs cheese crime,"
good,"It is a good place to work because the management was receptive and helpful. I did receive benefits, and I liked the coworkers.  I did receive vacation and I enjoyed the type of work.  I was able to go outside and move around a lot."
good,walmart was a fun place to work but is not a job i would reccomend as a career. compensation is poor compared to other jobs. They dont really hire full time to avoid offering benefits
good,"Working at Walmart though me a lot of things, like how to Communicate with managers, associates and customers at work place. I really enjoy working there but I think is time for me to find new I opportunities since I am planning to start college this fall."
good,Managed associates on a daily basis. Reviewed CCTV for preventative measures in controlling inventory levels according to company standards and guidelines.
good,"Being a cashier for a very crowded Walmart isn’t the most simplest job. You have to stand for hours, and be very tidy around your registers for the next cashier to use it. Overall talk to your customers and make sure their experience was well. The time will go by fast as long as you do so!"
good,"Working at Walmart was a blast, met alot of good people working there. management could be better but working there is kind of about the people you work with. You make good bonds. I mean they're Good days and bad days but overall i loved working there the pay could be better for the amount of responsibility they throw at you but there is good job security there. and decent pay i wouldn't say enough to make a carrer out of considering its a pain too try and move up but thats where it comes down to who you know."
good,"If you get the right position here, things will be great. You really have to know your skills and be patient with this company. It's a very fast paced work environment and also quite stressful at times."
good,"I think working at Walmart as a pharmacy technician was an amazing learning experience and I learned a lot. Decent pace, patient coworkers, decent customers."
good,"Walmart has been wonderful to me: excellent benefits, pay, and LOA policies. I seldom have any problems with management, but my days off are extremely inconsistent and I hardly ever get more than one at a time. I work at least 50 hours a week provided I dont have to stay over any. I often feel like I just don't have enough time with my family. Aside from the schedules it's a great place to work."
good,Pending the position. Management could use improvement. I have used the opened door policy and it did nothing for me. Organization could be improved. I was hired onto a job stating my hours of availability but the management did not know which hours i would work until two weeks into the position.
good,"Hardest part of the job here is standing all the time. Mostly a fast paced environment.  Deal with many customers on a daily basis. Many regulars and you get to see the kids from infants to school age grow! Loved my co-workers in the Pharmacy, will miss them very much. The cashier position has been eliminated."
good,Since I started working at Walmart I have always been in a leadership position and it always been easy to develop and grow. Always new positions and new tools to work with and learn
good,"Great place to work daily work is enjoyable."
good,"Unload pallets, organize shelves, use pallet jack to bring pallets to back room and throw trash in baler."
good,"Great benefits, flexible schedule. No overtime due to management bonuses. Great incentives quarterly, 401k match up to 6%, affordable insurance. Overall it has it's ups and downs but all jobs do."
good,"Walmart is a great company. Over the years, they have made major advancements to benefit the employees. They really won’t let you work over time unless it’s during a busy season. Careers can be pursued through Walmart. Most require overnight availability."
good,"I loved working at this store, if I could I would do it again no questions asked. Employees were friendly, not too many conflicts came up. It was a very relaxed environment and experience."
good,I learned and experience a lot at Walmart. Management would try to help as much as they could to keep the store running smoothly and the store is well organized. We try to our very best to solve any problems in the store and we don’t give up until we have a solution.
good,"Other than slight issues with management, it was a great place to work. I was promoted twice within a year and they were very understanding when my schedule had to be changed due to a conflict with my kids school schedule"
good,"Customer Service is top priority so we try to please the customer, while finding a balance and not losing money for the company. Management is friendly and eager to teach and train."
good,Great place to work. Compensation and benefits were good. Met a lot of wonderful people and  built some meaningful relationships but the job totally consumed my life.
good,Working at Walmart was really the stepping stone for something greater. It really made me want to explore more opportunities that I have and to go out and find them. It’s really a great place to work and helps you focus on what you want to do in the future.
good,"Most days were busy, but that's what I like.  Most employees are friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of my job was holiday seasons, sometimes we were shorthanded.  I enjoyed making friends and working together as a team. We always got our breaks and very rarely worked overtime."
good,es una empresa donde se trabaja muy bien pero no se cuenta con un equilibrio entre vida labora y vida familiar
good,Working for Wal-Mart was great besides the poor management there. Nice coworkers and they were helpful. 30 minutes for lunch was perfect. And as long as you were doing your job everybody was satisfied.
good,It Was shift work. Most of the time I was unloading a truck or on the floor selling TV's. Sometimes I would help customers with purchasing a cellphone.
good,I went to work every day and scanned ptoducts in the morning. Did picks that need to go out on the shelves. Stocked the freight helped the customer when needed.
good,"If you are a hard worker and are needing something for a stepping stone with great benefits, then this is the place for you. It might get a little hectic sometimes, but it can be a pretty great place."
good,"The csm’s abused their power, the point system was unreasonable, no one was happy with their jobs, if you have a 15 min break that shouldn’t include the walk to and from the break room."
good,"Your typical day as a cart associate will revolve around clearing the parking lot of any carts or trash. Walmart was my first job, and since then I've realized how different of a job it is. This job is really loose and you are basically granted to wonder any given spot of the parking lot with good reason. Management was also very kind, one day they gave us all one of those neck coolers to help with the heat of the sun. The hardest part of being a cart associate is dealing with the heat and remembering not to push yourself too hard. I remember there was this one time when the machine we use to push the carts broke so we had to bring them in by hand, it was probably the best exercise I've ever gotten."
good,Good working environment. The management helped when I was having issues with my children daycare schedule. The management also worked with my school schedule while I was in nursing school. I miss the co.workers
good,"For the most part it is a good place to work. Friendly atmosphere, caring individuals. Good benefits, not always the best hours. If you have drive and motivation you can move up, of course always depends on the management at a particular store."
good,"I worked last as a cashier, my customers always found me cheerful and helpful and smiling"
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you love people.  There are a wide variety of nationalities and cultures Walmart accommodates. The staff is usually very polite and helpful making it an easy place to work and feel comfortable in.
good,chill job overall. People you work with are generally nice and know what they are doing. Good amount of time for breaks. Things can get unorganzied at times
good,Once you get your foot in the door you definitely would have many opportunities to move up. It’s a great place to work if you understand retail is not an easy job to do
good,"Really like Walmart despite some of the rude customers but I can say it is a really interesting place to work, I enjoyed my time of working there met a lot of people"
good,Working at walmart has its ups and downs the work enviorment isnt to bad but mamagement could be better. they try and treat you as fair as possible with other employees but things can get out of hand. over all experiance is pretty good though
good,"Walmart was very versatile, I would go from the plant section, to the back to unload, to the floor to stock, to outside for the carts, to sweeping the store. Many different things to help out around the store."
good,Walmart over all is a great place to work I just feel like it wasn’t for me and also I feel as if management wasn’t at there best but they never fail to always push you to do your best
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Walmart and would do so again; lower management could be a bit more efficient, pay wages were a bit sporadic, hours were flexible and job security was high."
good,Walmart gives you the opportunity to advance in your career. Also works with your time..the problem with Walmart is the pay rate is very low they need to increase their pay rate. The work at Walmart is very hard to be paying their associates $12 .I love to work at Walmart for very long time.
good,Walmart is an okay place to work. Management could work on their attitudes a bit and stop with all the favoritism to promote other employees.. overall an okay place to work
good,I enjoyed the hour I worked and appreciated the organization I worked with. This corporation is easy to move up in the company an I ample amount of opportunity.
good,You get to move right the ladder working there. You get along with just about everyone you work with. The discount helps a little and plus you get to shop as soon as you get off
good,Everything about Walmart is amazing except the managers.  Coworkers can be ignored but poor management leads to stressful shifts. There’s no communication .
good,"It's a great company that going through a lot of changes including changing managers and supervisors and employees, the company is in competition with Amazon"
good,Nice starter job. It provides a lot of opportunities to move up in the job. It could easily become a career. Also the benefits are great. They also have quarterly bonuses
good,It’s great to have an associate lounge for breaks and lunch. Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner for associates that have to be away from their families during the holidays.
good,The night crew I worked with made it fun and exciting to keep the employees motivated. The store manager came in frequently and would praise his employees for a job well done
good,Time goes by quick since I’m busy most all day. I love days were I have to do less. The people there are amazing all was help when you need it. Most of the day I spend my time in the back getting freight ready to be stocked overnight
good,"Hard to keep associates on board with Walmart.  They don't have any work eithics,  So the production go way down and the management have to clean up the mess"
good,Filled up my job application to days later they called me when I came in for a job interview was told I could start with in a week Then started training that took a week and then they actually put you on the floor doing what you’re therefore
good,Management is great and co-workers help each other. great team work. you are able to move from one section to another. advancement is done from within.
good,"Great attendance is a plus, kind, fast,friendly and courteous, empathy,respect for others goes a long way. Doing great work and getting your job done as expected is always a plus for Advancement."
good,"I learned a lot at walmart, i learned hot to be with customers how to react to them, i was shy and know i can do bettee and talk to people. I learned ho to look up insurances, sell glasses, and that makes me feel goos because patients always want tour help and your opinion. So when you help them choose they feel happy."
good,"Friendly co-workers, once you warm up to them. Mgmt. works as hard as you do. Kinda slow hiring new employees after one quits."
good,"Walmart as a company does have some great benefits, it just takes some time for those benefits to actually be useful to an individual. Overall Walmart is a good first job or low experience job."
good,"Ensure that all operations are carried out properly in accordance with rules and regulations."
good,"You stay busy because there is always something to do. Always room for your input for improvement. A good place to learn about organizational skills. "
good,Great place to work! It all depends on management! Great health benefits! Not as busy as a supercenter! Get to deal with alot of crazy customers!Management can be good one day and another day can be really mean to you! Watch out!
good,Walmart the company is great management on the other hand is not some store could have better management . Working for Walmart opened a lot for me some employees helped me get thru things
good,"I was an overnight support manager for 3 years and had great success in that position. However, when I tried to get promoted to a salary position it was difficult for someone who only worked 3rd shift and there was way to much of a pay differential from 3rd to the other shifts. I had an assistant who really worked with me but left for another career opportunity in the company. Her replacement was not so helpful."
good,"Nice place to work with many opportunities for growth.  Moving forward and becoming more tech savvy.  They face many challenges from other online competitors, but they are investing large sums of money to meet these challenges."
good,The only thing that really got to me about the place is that you could do the work of THREE associates and were still not allowed more than 40 hrs because you'd have to be paid 1.5 times your pay.
good,"Unloaded the trailers, stocked the shelf, worked the returns for the store. I learned a lot about the RF guns. Management was always there to help if needed."
good,It's a very productive workplace though it could use some improvement. Most of the management team there are very helpful with working around your schedule if needed.
good,"buen lugar acorde a la renta del mercado, donde hay también facilidades de trabajo para personas con discapacidad y en verano a menores de edad hasta 16 hijos de los  colaboradores"
good,"Have been through many management changes.  The current management is good. Although words of praise are common, raises are hard to come by.  Some of the employees care about their work; however, it is challenging to work with those who just get by the bare minimum.  The ones who care pick up the slack and work hard, but it appears those who just do the minimum are paid the same as those who care and work hard."
good,"The people I work with are the best, hard-working and fun at the same time.  Our direct supervisors are helpful; some upper management however is not."
good,Walmart is fun and busy environment to work in with activites or events happening here and there all the time. The only problem is shift availability needs to be open in order to get more hours.
good,The hardest part of the job is loosing one of your patients after having had the privilege of getting to know them over the years. On the flip side is the absolute privilege of having become part our patients lives in a positive way through out the years.
good,I enjoyed working in the stock room and operating the forklift.  Some managers saw the people that worked hard and didn’t see the ones slaking. Hard for some people to advance in the company.
good,Good environment and good training. But managers can be a little nicer to staff and more helpful with the stocking of the items when someone is over welmed with goods.
good,Walmart works well with you but doesn’t always have the right people in management. Attendance policy is pretty good. PTO hours are not accumulated that fast and you do get an hour lunch.
good,"Walmart was s relaxing workplace with good team work but also timed on stocking. Mandatory I"
good,I love working at Walmart it’s a great company involving in community and education. I highly recommend Walmart to anyone who wants to have a career. Follow the rules.
good,Walmart provide many jobs in different areas.There is room to promote and move up within the company at the speed you like. They also have many ways to provide help on a personal level if needed.
good,"This job is consistent with the work load that is provided each shift  and employees stay busy throughout the day. Management checks in on workers to make sure that the task at hand is being done correctly and in a reasonable amount of time. The culture of the workplace is upbeat and productive, which makes the work go by. However, the most enjoyable part of the day is your lunch break."
good,Wal-Mart was a great place to work after high school and through college. After finishing school they gave me ample opportunities to advance. Benefits and pay were okay for the time I was there.
good,It’s a good place to start if you are wanting to learn how to manage your own department and to see how many different events can affect your inventory. Over all I have learned so much from working here.
good,"Great place to work, very nice environment, great people to work with, hours were very decent, pay was very decent, just a great place to work, anyday"
good,Spent days on register checking out customers. Learned enough on the register to be transferred to customer service doing refunds. The hardest part of the job was trying not to let some of the sad stories get to you emotionally. The best part was meeting new people all the time and making new friends.
good,"i enjoyed going into work, i enjoyed working with my coworkers as a team. we made the job fun. They were able to schedule around my school schedule. the management would take into are considerations of are issues."
good,Love my co-workers and the managers are pretty awesome but the point system seems to be set up for high turnover and is unfair for those who haven't been there 10 years or more. 5 points is ridiculous. Especially when you have emergencies...the protective pto only helps if you've been there 6 months with no absences...js.
good,"Typically stay busy through out the day. Harder when understaffed. Ive learned price changed, how to run a cash register, section work, attending the door, as well as many other assets to the job. "
good,"Working at Walmart was high paced but a very enjoyable, if I was given a choice to work there again, I would. The staff is very friendly, and the job was managed very well."
good,Very fast pace. As long as you do your job you're good. A lot of people really talk bad about this company.  Like I tell the new people it will be exactly what you make it.
good,Able to really get to know your coworkers and become comfortable with working with them. Management was always really kind and willing to work with you to achieve better results.
good,"Walmart has helped me stay afloat with college and work. being flexible and understanding of my hours. I would recommend this job for young adults, who needs a semi-steady job."
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar, os associados prestativos,a gerencia sempre prestativa e comunicativa com os funcionários sempre abertos para novas ideias e sugestões."
good,"I really enjoyed my various positions with Walmart and enjoyed training at multiple locations while my store was being built. They do care about their employees and show it in many ways. I was willing to learn anything so it did not get boring and I moved around depts. I really enjoyed the management that my store had originally but the manager that took over has ruined it.  The hardest part of my jobs were handling meat/dairy and frozen and being expected to cap all 3 coolers, run the freight, do orders, change counts, do cvp's all by 10-11 all by myself most days. As CSM the hardest part was being made to get carts constantly in the freezing cold when I had been sick for a couple months.I loved working with the customers and most of my fellow employees as long as they did their job."
good,Coworkers are great but if you are not a people person then I'd recommend working in the back room. Most of the supervisors are really great and will work with you if need be.
good,"It was a fun job, a lot of nice people to be around. I was payed well, I had many hours almost everyday to work. It was really busy almost everyday so I was focused in on the work to get it accomplished for that day."
good,"Great place to learn, teaches how to handle stress full situations well. Sometimes the work life and home life is not well balanced, but at the end of the day, the demand is to rise to the occasion and be competitive. Sink or swim."
good,"Close relationship to management almost always guarantees a interview. Scheduling is getting better, co workers sometimes have no need in teamwork or communication."
good,"electronics is always a busy dept."
good,Walmart is you either like it or hate it. The people there are fun to work with. I have met some great friends there. A typical day at work for me is I get to meet new people there.
good,Its a job nothing special about it. You show up and work and go home. You can try to get transferred to a different shift but they drag their feet unless you hound them.
good,Walmart has always treated me really good. when i needed more hours my manager gave me a bunch of secondary jobs so i could keep my hours up. when i couldn't come in as early as they wanted me there they almost always worked with me and got my schedule changed last minute.
good,Working at Walmart was pretty good. I enjoyed being there. The pay was pretty decent and they give you plenty hours. The only thing I didn't like was they never give you weekends off.other than that it's a pretty good place to work of you enjoy working with the public
good,I worked for walmart for just over 6 years. i left because they realized they were not going to make any profit with the grocery store with the management structure they had. the overhead in wages was way to high. i learned a lot and walmart WILL match your pace so work hard work well and you will get rewarded for it.
good,"* gives some leeway with arrival time  "
good,Walmart was ok.. Gathering up the shopping carts.. I liked because it was a job working outside.. and it gave me a kind of freedom. I like the job....
good,"I've been in asset protection for 4 years between working at Walmart,  Target, Sears, and Ross. Walmart doesnt give you the proper training to do your job, luckily I have learned everything I need from other companies and adapted very well. As an asset protection associate you must be able to run your position like a business and not depend on anyone. You will have minimal oversight and management will expect you to complete your duties without them telling you to. If you can handle that you will be fine, if not you will be coached, demoted to customer host (door greeter), or fired. Asset Protection Associates(APA) in Florida make $15/hr and more if you have experience. "
good,"easy to work with coworkers, customers were nice and friendly, management was great. management really cared about the store and its customers, and the store was always clean."
good,I really have enjoyed my experience with Walmart. It’s really is like a family and their are oprtunties . For those who want them. Overall it was a great job.
good,Descent place to work management is friendly and descent to communicate with. Co-workers are funny to be around and welcoming into the work place. Pay is descent and full time employment benefits are good. They also offer a retirement program.
good,"Management can be lazy and not listen to problems that you tell them of. Some seem to be incompetent in their managing. Some managers do know how to organize and plan for what needs to be done.     You get paid time off based off of your time worked. You get protected paid time off for sudden reasons to leave. Also gained through hours worked. You get 5 points of freedom. It is alright in that it is hard to get all five points. They didnt seem to care though if someone was sick for too long, even in the hospital."
good,"Is a place where you can learn as you want, you learn how to be calm and respectful even on the most dark situations , is a work where you nee to be fast and a great opportunity to get skills on customer service."
good,"I did ok at wal mart just wish my daughter didnt have to die.I was working on being a assistant mamager over fresh area. I leaned how to order,inventory,check backroom. The job wasnt that bad if just did the work."
good,"Work would include unloading freight into zones based on the merchandise's department, then stocking the most essential departments first.  The job was physically demanding but rewarding at the end of the day."
good,"Good culture, big opportunities but it’s impossible balance personal life with work. Schedule sometimes no reasonable, to much pressure restocking and customer unattended"
good,Was a good place learn how to work with customers as i was working in the Electronics Department. Was often working alone and closing the department. Was Always busy and often helping customers.
good,Always something to do here. Started as dept manager and got promoted to asst manager  of the whole store. My mom pasted away during mybtine there. The store manager was great.
good,Walmart did give me many opportunities to advance my career by allowing me to go to school and first get my Bachelor's then my Masters in Education. They generally worked with my school schedule especially during internship which was  big plus. Not too hard of a job. Come in. Do your work and for the most part you were left to do whatever tasks you were given in your department. Good company especially for those entering the workforce and needing work skills.
good,Got along with coworkers  pretty well. Customers were not too hard to deal with and the work was fairly easy aside being pulled to push carts. Breaks and lunch were given on a time.
good,"Gained valuable experience in:  sales, customer service and management.  "
good,"Es un buen lugar para laborar, sobre todo si te gusta el contacto diario con mucha gente. "
good,There wasn't enough staff and there were a lot of associate doing double jobs. There want enough equipment. And I didn't agree with the way they did pay increases and gave all the long time associates a small lump sum.
good,I loved working at Walmart because of my outlook on working. it was holding me back from growing because of certain people in the company. I was a praised employee by customers.
good,I learn a lot bout stock and unloading trucks etc Walmart gave us good benefits for long u for the company. Management not even good at the job they are doing
good,"It is hard work to work here. But in the back room the work you put forth is well worth it. You do not have to deal with the general public very much at all, which if you are not much of a people person like me, you will very much enjoy. They have a 10% employee discount for you. Also there are times they bring in food, cakes or donuts. In the back room you work with the same folks every day, and that is nice because you develop many friendships."
good,Enjoyable work environment with friendly coworkers and managers. There is a family like culture. Most co-associates are friendly and enjoyable to work with.
good,Nice place to work. Associates treat you with respect and work as a team. Fun atmosphere to work in as well. Often feel like my store manager is afraid to help develop his management team in order to promote them.
good,Its a awesome place to work if your not a people person i recommend you do not work here but i loved working at walmart. The gave me over time anytime i needed it.
good,I liked working for Walmart. The managers cared and always kept the employees busy and knew how to keep everyone in a good mood. They also offered good benefits.
good,"My day usually began at 4:00am, we had to cull and check dates of produce, It was a major issue, on corporate walks. Hardest part of working there was damages of product. Enjoyed working and supervising workers, i had the best group of people."
good,Working at Walmart was not terrible because my coworkers were really great amazing. The team aspect of working was my favorite because I did not feel like I was alone and had people I could count on.
good,"In working at walmart you need to be firm and tough..."
good,"I have no major complaints at all.  I am been discouraged on occasion, but on the whole, they are a pretty cordial company to work with/for.  I just need more hours and better hours for my family."
good,I started as stocking shelves at night and when I left I was a Zone Manager of 5 departments.  Stocking shelves is a self motivating position which I enjoyed.  Learned how to delegate jobs when I was a Zone Manager.  I learned patience dealing with customers who could be frustrated.
good,Walmart is a nice place to work. Also in certain areas they paid good money. The are all over the city and are always hiring. My time at Walmart wasn’t that long because of school situations but I enjoyed my time working there. Meet new people.
good,I love working at Wal-Mart and I especially liked to be a customer service manager but I want to be in a higher position so I wanted to change our work consists of interacting with customers and helping them organize the times of the workers who are responsible for them work the store accounts organize what we need of the goods in our sections and prepare the money  In the roger
good,Be able to count quickly and multitask. Be friendly and patient with the customers and you must always pay attention to what your doing and where you are .
good,We could use more help in some areas and management being more understanding about their people and their families like if our kids are sick and we have to leave we souldnt get a point for it
good,"Uncomfortable management team"
good,Walmart is a good job i love it i just need a part time because im not getting enough hours and they wsnt move me to a different area just tired of overnight shifts
good,"Being one of the biggest retail stores I have ever worked for, it was definitely busy. But it is a good environment to work in if you want to learn a lot of information in a short time. In the ten months, I had worked for Wal-mart I had learned how to cashier, run a self check-out location. OGP (online grocery pickup) Customer service, money center, and courtesy clerk/cart pusher. All the associates take care of each other and work really well together, even though most of the rungs up the ladder don't care about the cashiers."
good,Benefits are good as is the pay and you earn it by working hard and long hours.  Extra days and functions on off days can become exhausting.  They may interfere with work life balance.
good,Walmart was a good job in loss prevention. They had on the job training and you learn how to do many apprehensions. The only problem is with advancement. Do to the specific field on limted positions are available to advance
good,Walmart was a great job it was a fast paced job with great coworkers. I loved working cash register I also liked stocking and zoning the isles I would recommend this job to a friend.
good,It's a job. I love the people I work with. They are a family to me. Things I don't like at work is the slow times. And things I do like is the time going fast and succeeding at my job.
good,"Walmart is a cool. The pay is decent and you can get pretty good hours. The work can be stressful, but not over-bearing. I recommend Walmart definitely."
good,I loved working here. I had problems with the hours and the stress but otherwise. It wasnt a horrible. Job. The management and the people were good people.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. I was always night shift so I got really cool CSMs working with me, though sometimes they didn't do anything but stand on their phone. For the most part, working there was fun, but when the manager was in a mood, it literally affected everyone and there was a lot of drama. I worked the max amount of hours I could as a part-timer per week and my paychecks were pretty good for a college student with a few bills. One other negative thing about working there is that if you show that you work hard and can do a lot of work, they will expect you to do everything, even things not in your job group."
good,"It was a wonderful experience. I'm just happy I had the opportunity to work for this Walmart it was my favorite one in the area. The GM is a sweetheart, he is very professional and surprisingly he remembers almost everyones names. He was hands down one of the best managers this far. The job itself was great too. I liked my crew, we did good team work and they were very appreciative of that."
good,Working at Walmart was nice. Co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. Usually on a shift you’re taking charge of a section by yourself with a set list of tasks assigned by the department manager.
good,"Love the discounts and occasional free food and drinks, and partys for employees. Love some of the benefits, and bonuses. I dont like when management noticices your hard work ethic, how'd they pull you to work to do things management doesnt want to do."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. They provide wonderful benefits and decent pay. The Walmart that I work at has recently switched to closing at night which is really nice. Paid time off is accumulated on how many hours you work. Call ins are numbered and if you call in 5 times in 6 months you will be fired. (Depending on circumstances)
good,"While there are a lot of jokes about ""working at Wal-Mart"" it was a great place to work and learn the in's and out's of retail. They are a massive company and have thousands of happy and satisfied workers for a reason. Really enjoyed my time there."
good,Working is fun because employees are fun and uplifting. Management tries their best to help you with the needs to work. Attendance policy is sometimes hard to keep with.
good,"Everyone has a role in the company and as an associate I seen good teamwork from my co workers not so much from the managers though. The overall experience of working for the company great. They have motivational meetings in the morning, they also rewarded us with food from different restaurant to show their appreciation."
good,I enjoyed my short time working for this company as a youth first entering the job market.I had the oppurtunity to work with many different people with a diverse series of backgrounds and cultures.
good,Working at Walmart requires an interpersonal attitude. You have to be able to spark up conversations with customers in order to address their needs and wants. Having background information on the products that they are looking for helps a lot. The employees at Walmart make shifts go by much faster because most of them accept you into the workplace with open arms.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a clean cooler after you have stocked the shelves completely. The hardest part of the job is working on your own because it becomes overwhelming and the brain cannot think what to do next.
good,"un buen ambiente laboral, se aprende de los diferentes secciones y sistema de la empresa. lo dificil y contra de la empresa es el bajo salario y gran exigencia"
good,buenas políticas y cultura empresarial y compañerismo
good,"Walmart has good benefits. Working there is pretty good. It really depends who you work with, and how much management stays on slacking people. Sometimes good workers have to pick up the slack of bad workers, which causes them to be burnt out. But if you are a good associate, you can move up in the company."
good,Great work place. Awesome managers and constantly willing to help if your schedule work area is loaded with to much frieght. Great associate. Overall a good place to work with friendly people.
good,"Walmart is a great company for advancement and moving up. Teaching and training if you get a store that cares. I loved working there, but with a family, it isn't for me anymore."
good,"Working at Walmart takes a special person. Especially the one I had worked at because it was considered to be in the poorer side of town. All the sketchy people would go there, and all the Burningman goers would be there as well. And it's even crazier when it's the beginning of the month because all the foodstamp recipients are around. This job will literally test your patience with handling people. You've got to be able to move quick, and have enough patience to deal with literally thousands of customers a day. Most management employees here were quite kind, helpful and polite, but just like any job, there were some who seemed to just think they were better than anyone else. Thankfully there were only like one or two of those.. The hardest part of this job are the customers who think they're so entitled that they shouldn't have to wait in the same line as foodstamp recipients and people who don't have enough money when they shop that they need to return a few items from their purchases. The most enjoyable part is when I got to see the regular customers who always return and are always buying vegetables and fruits for their young children. The children were always so polite and friendly, and they always remember our names."
good,"I have enjoyed the time I have spent at Walmart and leaving is a very difficult decision.  I met many interesting and hard-working people since I have been there and I would gladly do it again.  But, now I feel as if it is time for me to move on and challenge myself further in a different company."
good,it was a good fun workplace had a lounge to eat in snack machines a hour lunch break and it was friendly. the co-workers was fun to get along with and the discounts they gave us
good,"Working at Walmart is an easy job to help you obtain the skills you need for future jobs... fast paced, lots of different people so you can develop people skills, many different departments for you to learn about products and inventory."
good,"I worked at the Walmart in Meridian Idaho, and a little in Spencer, IA. Walmart in Meridian was a nice place to work. I loved my supervisor!  The only thing I did not like was working nights and when you apply, you have a better chance if you say open in all areas. I tried to transfer to days, but I was denied. I did advance from a stocker to IMS in the back room."
good,"Empresa com oportunidades, mas precisava de mais organização. Um ambiente de trabalho."
good,It’s alright if you have the patience to put up with irrelevant stuff  or what not because patience is key to surviving  learn how to voice your opinion and to communicate with your managers
good,"I worked evenings until the next morning. As far as your personal live goes, you will be sleepy. On the other hand you will be paid well. Starting pay is 14 and hour and after 3 months you get raise of 2 dollars."
good,I had my ups and downs while working for Walmart. This was my first job and I started as a sales associate in electronics. I then moved up to department manager and quickly became Assistant Manager. At the time I worked for them I didn't realize how much I would miss it when I left.
good,"Typical day would be stocking the floor and cleaning areas."
good,Walmart is an excellent place for high school students and part-timers however when it comes to advancements the positions are far and few in between.
good,"it’s a good company to work for and you can always move up in the company , they have good benefits and a 401k plan that can help out with your future"
good,Overall enjoyable place to work. Fast paced environment. Resources provided if you have any questions or concerns. Management was very helpful for the most part.
good,constantly doing things to keep busy. fast paced environment. There is much training continuously. Learning different skills all the time. There are other opportunities to pursue.
good,"Excellent place to work if you want job security, and are willing to be flexible to work hard, be punctual, and enjoy a fast paced work atmosphere.Opportunity for advancement is both realistic, and recommended."
good,pleasant place to work...however if one struggles with health issues and must undergo procedures there isn't any form of job security unless of course you have held that position for over six months and return within 12 weeks without too many medical restrictions.
good,"They are really good with people. They know how to work with others. They know how to keep everything together and in a working matter. Good vibes, they know how to treat they’re employees"
good,Walmart is a great fun and challenging place to work.  If you’re looking for a way to easily move out through retail Walmart is the place to go. They offer so many opportunities.
good,"My typical work day would be scanning items for customers and helping them with any of there needs. I learned how to be patient and communicate with the customers.  The management was amazing, they are there if you have any problem with your schedule and if you need some kind of flexibility for an important reason. The hardest part of this job is when a customer asked a question that only the manager is able to answer fully but the manager may have other duties before getting to your station or if there is a problem with a item that is not able to be scanned. The most enjoyable part is seeing customer happy with what they have and to have a good conversations with them."
good,Other than not getting paid and no benefits it was a great job.  It was laid back but when it was busy it still wasn't stressful.  Some of the customers were on edge but it was okay.
good,"Culture is emphasized every day at Walmart; people at the home office are very nice, complete opposite to what people believe."
good,"I like it. Its cool, No big complains. Love the people I worked with. I got up made doughnuts. then bread. Baked what needed to be baked .Went to the deli."
good,It was a great work experience at the time. But the company went out ta business n had to relocate. I would try it for the work but wouldnt make it a main priority as a career worker.
good,It’s been good to work at Walmart it was a great experience but too bad I had to move to California for better opportunities which was a mistake and now I’m back to get that opportunity here and do better of myself and enrolling myself to school
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work as long as you have good management. It's fast paced but can be very stressful. There are so many different things you have to do besides what you're hired for.
good,Work to build company. Customer centered Leadership skills. Going with the changes and to help others to exceed mentor teach and train and follow up  Learning at all times to exceed  above to move others along
good,"I really love working with the public and I enjoy meeting new people. I think Walmart is a good company, but they are changing more all the time and it seems like it's for the worse. I am ready for a change where I can keep moving forward. Overall I would say Walmart is fairly a good company."
good,"Worked in electronics, photo, fabric, stationary, site to store, Helped customers, cashier, stocked shelves, put away stock, retrieved tvs, cut fabric, etc."
good,It was a good job over all. But from talking to current people working there point system is extremely tight. I also was a cashier and they are cutting down on that possition.
good,Working there was fun but stressful. Hours were inconsistent. The managers at the time made things stressful. But my coworkers were amazing to work with.
good,"Good place to work. I enjoyed working as a tech, repairing equipment and installing new equipment.  Fast pace and good pay make this place a good environment to learn."
good,loved working there fun and Good pacing got a discount on purchases helped the enviroment. one thing i didnt like where the maximum points we had in total
good,"Fun and relaxing, but also fast-paced. have to be on a schedule to keep track of your area such as stocking shelves plus picking merchandise. no such thing as over time."
good,"Pretty decent job If you enjoy moving around a lot, and multi-tasking. Schedule was always 2/3 weeks out, I enjoy the freedom to work on my own without being micromanaged. Hours were also set which was nice. "
good,"I like working at walmart because it was easy going environment, friendly associates. I feel the wages were equivalent and fair to the job positions. Plenty of chances for promotions."
good,I had a good experience working at Walmart. The co workers were pleasant and so were the customers. I had  very good health benefits and great hours. It's a great place to work.
good,"Laid back, non stressful, slow paced place to work. Bad communication with management and worker. For me to much long period of time walking/standing."
good,Walmart is a very fun experience job you could ever have. Everyday is a learning experience for the co-worker at Walmart. You should come in on time and be ready to work everyday because the customers are coming soon!
good,I do not to this day have anything negative to say about the employees of Walmart. They are a good group of people. They were by far the best aspect of that job.
good,Buena empresa y buena atención a clientes y buen servicio
good,"There was always something to do and there is always something going on to keep you busy. Associates are like your second family other than the work demand and stress from cooperate or DM visits everything was great,,"
good,It's not the company that's so bad.It was the management.It was mainly a few of the Assistant Managers. I loved the co-workers in my department. I loved the Can. God knows if it wasn't for them a lot of times my department would be in trouble.
good,Very laid back environment. Pay was decent and paid bi-weekly. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Seasonal help so was let go right after the holiday season ended.
good,Walmart is great for most people. It pays the bills and comes with some pretty decent benefits as well. If you get into the management side of things the salary is pretty competitive too.
good,I treated every customer like they where family. I always had a warm smile on my face and keep small conversation going with anyone I meet. Overall it was a fun and new experience.
good,"Its a good first job. Pays well for unskilled labor. Has okay benefits. working conditions are pretty good. Some times it can get stressful or workload is crazy, but it balances out with slow work time as well."
good,Great store to work for most managers where really cool and understood what there employees needed. Uf you needed a day off or had an emergency. Love.
good,I enjoyed my years at Walmart. You really learn how to work with people. There is room for advancement. You can move to different dept's. They are very family oriented. The work is not hard if you take pride in what you do.
good,I worked at a neighborhood market stocking overnight as a second job. the store changed its hours and was no longer 24/7 management was willing to work with me and adjust my schedule. I worked in the frozen/ dairy and meat departments. the hardest part of the job is the constant work with little time to finish.
good,"Part time job to help financially for my family. Hard on your body being on your feet for so long. Great discounts, nice work environment.  Considering going back."
good,WalMart is a good place to work.  It offers lots of advantages and opportunities especially for younger employees.  Working part-time is fine except that the hours are staggered and no definite work schedule.
good,This is a great job to learn how to stock shelves and communicate with customers. You also learn many valuable skills for later in life and are able to advance quickly.
good,"Various tasks, which were all handled at diligent paces, hours were steady, and long, employees were mostly friendly but it also had an unwelcoming atmosphere to work in."
good,Company does what it can to help out its employees. They try to move up who they can and make sure you feel welcomed into the staff. Sometimes can be strict with projects though.
good,I love the people I work with. Its good pay but the hours you get suck. Not really enough to make it on ur own other than that it really is a good job
good,"Walmart Distribution Center high pace"
good,"Great place to work. I started in electronics helping customers meet there home entertainment and electronic needs. After a while, I was ended in front cash working inside customer service. My management was flexible with my work schedule. The work culture was fair as long as your willing to do your part of your job. This means showing up for scheduled shifts and handling your scan rates.  Paying attention to customers needs."
good,"Typical day at Wal-Mart is making sure all associates are productive, customer are taken care.  Looking at metrics and numbers and profit."
good,Little supervision but everyone wants to do their job most of the time to create a prosperous workplace environment/culture. The hardest part of the job is the break system and the most boring part is zoning but the best part of the job are the associates!
good,"very fast paced work, with plenty of perks.   As long as you get along with your co-workers, your job will go smoothly.  One had washes the other.  The benefits and pay are excellent"
good,"The working environment as a cart pusher is harsh by weather conditions, but always working outside where the fresh air is at.The most important work the has to be done is cars always cars that comes around the corner when you least expect it."
good,"Ok to work for. I moved up pretty fast, the more experience you have the better. I ran service desk and was assistant. I would run to help electronics if they needed anything. Took money to pharmacy, etc."
good,"Great place to work, too inconsistent on hours, excellent benefits compensation, stable job security and management, people can sometimes either be great to work with or drive someone insane"
good,"Go in open boxes to start stacking shelves, all the while helping and greeting customers. align items to look neat on shelf was a main focus. lifting heavy items wasn't fun and walking an average of 15k steps"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Walmart because they took into count that I was a college student that had a busy schedule and a life of my own. I enjoyed working in the areas I did because of the  continuous customer interactions."
good,"The Walmart in Harahan was horrible with keeping some of the employees in line with coming to work on time, even on lunch breaks. It was a lot of seniority going on in that department."
good,"They should listen to their employees smite often. Sometimes, I feel that the company picks and choose which employee opinions to listen to. It really is disheartening."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , dan cursos Rápido a tu ingreso"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart DC. Non-Con was hard work and steady. Would work that area again. Keeps a person in shape.Working Maintenance keeps you busy. Only thing is promotions based on who manager likes, not experience."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for a student. Personally, retail is not for me, but for someone who likes retail it is a place where one can advance in ranks if you work hard."
good,I loved working at Walmart! The managers were good and they worked with me on my hours.  I didn’t like not having set hours and days to work. I never knew when I was working until the day before. They put out schedules but they would change within 12 hours of a shift starting. I enjoyed working with customers and trying to improve how stores treat customers
good,Es una empresa que se preocupa por el recurso humano
good,Stocking the department overnight and cleaning up once i am done. How to bend with your knees and not your back. You can have back problems later on in life if you lyft with your back constantly instead of your knees. How fast you have to be at stocking in such a short amount of time that you have some times was a challenge.
good,"I had fun while I was there. It wasnt much to do other than stocking and cleaning. The management was good, we were well taken care off for the most part. The hours got cut short so changes had to be made."
good,"Great place to work . Great people! fast paced, physically demanding job. Compensation is adequate benefits are also adequate. Love working for them. Great tuition assistance program."
good,"Working at Walmart is productive, some lack of communication between upper and lower management. Enjoy working Ecommerce. Fast paced working environment."
good,If you are injured or a major sickness ask hr about sedwic and stay on top of management with it. That's why I no longer work here. One manager didnt file the paperwork correctly and boom I was terminated.
good,this place is okay. i enjoy working there for the reasons of my co workers without them the job would be a pain but the culture of us sticking together makes it worth it.
good,I pretty much learned every area and every thing I possibly could and my days are always busy. You get more hours if you have open availability. They really appreciate associates with good attendance
good,"I didn't mind it, there's lots jobs to choose if your not into your current one, decent amount of advancement. Employee discount can be useful since they have so many items. management OK. pay sucks and will try anything for yearly raise to diminish. Don't waste your time on any shift besides overnights for differential unless you enjoy being broke all the time. You can even get written up for having just 30 seconds of overtime."
good,overall great place to work great work place I enjoyed the people I worked around and I also enjoyed being on the medical staff while I worked at Walmart for a year in a half.
good,"good place everyone was nice to eachother the pay was matched with places around town so that was nice, and the managers are always smiling and nice happy to help, they told me I was the only person they could stick in certain peoples isles and not get compaints"
good,I personally loved working as a Cap 2 Associate. I loved unloading the trucks and being on the line. I loved the work crew I had. We all worked well together and got our work done. We enjoyed being a part of a team. Stocking the shelves and being on the floor helping customers was one of my favorite job duties. I loved meeting new people that came into the store and needed help. I loved working in the infants department. That became my department where I was most comfortable and did my best work.
good,"I worked many many positions at Walmart regardless of if that was my job title or not. You will last a long time and move up quickly if you are willing to do more than what is asked of you and if you volunteer to work over your shift or cover shifts. I loved working for my first store, but when I had to move and transfer stores that is when I left the company. The other store was just unreasonable. I did not like the management like I did at my first store. They did not work with my schedule like they did at my first store. So I would say ultimately I think it just comes down to your perception of your store and what you are willing to do to move up."
good,"If you want to work and succeed here you have to come in knowing its a nice and good paying job , but you will work hard no doubt. You have to nake the most of your breaks as the work is hard and steady. You of course are paid pretty good and have benefits as well but you will work for it."
good,"I worked there for just a few months to pay off a mission trip to "
good,"steady job, worked inside many different Walmarts for various clients. Signed in upon entering the store, met with various dept. managers to secure display space, took pictures for verification, great times!"
good,"People friendly. management is good. safe place to work, good training program. difference culture is welcome. open door policy and anyone can join the health insurance."
good,"My time working at Walmart with an enjoyable experience. My co-workers were great the customers were fantastic and a management was helpful, understanding, and overall enjoyable to be around."
good,Working at Walmart help me to maintain self control and the ability to work along with no supervision.  I learned to work well with others.  Walmart has a busy work environment.
good,en lo particular tienen un gran ambiente laboral .
good,I got fired and didn't think fair.no security there.other then that was great place.after I got fired they brought in all drivers to go over the policy.
good,"trabajo estable pero en negro, trabaje como encargado con personal a  mi cargo"
good,"One of the last places where hard work alone can advance you through the ranks, competitive pay,  fast paced environment that is always evolving, requires lots of investment to be successful in role though which makes work and life balance quite difficult."
good,"My typical day at work involved downstacking the meat and produce truck and scanning each item to determine if it should be stocked with the My Productivity app on the MC40 or TC70. Then stocking the freight by first in first out and binning the overstock in its respective place in the backroom or cooler followed by lunch. After lunch it was simply keeping up with customer demand and stocking whatever needed to be restocked until the day was over."
good,"Muy buena empresa pagos a tiempo, poca vida familiar si quieres crecer"
good,"I helped open this store and it was amazing to see it grow, but the typical day in season was so hectic you did not know if you were coming or going. out of season it was a struggle to get hours as we were slower, but it still felt like we did not have enough people. I had some really good managers, but like always there were definitely some bad ones that often made it hard. the workplace could also be friendly one moment, and cut throat the next. i made some good friends, but often dealing with the rude, belligerent customers that only wanted what they wanted regardless of policy or if you were allowed to or not."
good,Worked here part-time as an overnight stocker while going to school during the day. I only worked like 24hrs/week. I was in the frozen/dairy department and we were definitely underpaid. But if your there for awhile (5 years) the benefits start kicking in real good.
good,Changing environment. Hardest and best part of job are the customers. Learned how to lead people and manage large projects. Management is fair because we have a p
good,It is a productive environment. Average hours. Pretty good management team. Growth opportunities in the company. Available promotions are offered. Sustainable pay.
good,Working for Walmart has allowed me to grow in my customer service skills and being able to communicate with people. It has also allowed me to become efficient at working at a fast pace.
good,The managers are the worst how did they even end up where they are at some even try to give a raise and lie to you very rude cussing at you some even try to talk nice but talk inappropriately behind your back
good,"Productive and manage well. Room for improvement, co-worker friendly, etc. If you have any problems you should go to your supervisor or management and advised to them."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you want to deal with the public in several different areas of the store.  I worked in several different areas with different coworkers and different teams.
good,"I enjoyed ALL of my CSMs, but some of the higher up management was iffy. They would change their minds constantly, never kept up with time off requests, and WalMart has started a new point system without letting a lot of associates know. It's a good first job, but I hope someone gets a better opportunity at their store than what I got at mine."
good,"Great Company to work for Overall, I have enjoyed working for the company for the most part, it is not a difficult place to work, its easy to learn, The difficult part is the harsh attendance policy they have, Makes it stressful sometimes when you cant get a point approved if it was not avoidable and you cant do anything to prevent the circumstances, there are some ways around it, but it tends to be very time consuming and not all options tend to get explained in detail."
good,"cumplir con la rutina, verificar que todo el persona haya entrado y este realizando sus actividades diarias, recibo de mercancía, atención a proveedores, solución de conflictos con clientes, arqueos de caja, autorización para trabajo en alturas."
good,"Ambiente laboral muy estresante, buena comunicación con los compañeros de trabajo"
good,Walmart isn't the type of job that you want because some of your co worker aren't a team player to help you out to get the job done before your shift ends at night they leave you standard to do there work for them instead of staying there to help you finish the work for that day.
good,Great place to move up rapidly but there's a lot of favoritetism. I personally love working for Walmart because I love the job and duties I do helping customers is my favorite thing.
good,"Graveyards was independent for the most part. It was mainly 1-2 people per department, and working in the freezer section I was able to get things done every night even if by myself."
good,good coworkers ... i was in a customer service postion ... friendly people in wesfield mass... love this place i will recommend to work in it ...but its minum wedage paid
good,It was a well run company and offered great sales experience. It also gave you a chance to move up after a year if you exceeded expectations and impressed manangement
good,"Productive and fun loving environment sually inspect equipment and controls at periodic intervals to detect malfunctions or need for repair, adjustment or lubrication."
good,Walmart was very good to me the 12 years I was there but it is not a easy job. It is very stressful to be a Deptment Manager for them because you are responsible for everything that goes on in your Department. A lot of times you don't have adequate help to accomplish the daily goals that pop up. During the Holidays is the busiest and most stressful times and you pretty much live there and have no time with your family. But it was a steady income and the pay was decent so it made up for it
good,A good job with great benefits. Most of us are like family there been there for so long. Of course have your rough and long day. Great job for students in school they do work with your schedule. Only thing i don't like is cutting hours and how some of the management treats you.
good,"I worked in the Site-To-Store and Layaway areas, so I didn't have a typical day at work. I collected the items that come in from customer orders, and binned them, which generated an email to the costumer."
good,"Fun people to work with! Management can be difficult sometimes, but it depends on who you work for! Overall not a bad place to work! Fast pace work! Of course I'm talking the warehouse! I  worked there 20years ! Quality and quantity is a must here! It can get stressful at times too! They don't take Dr. "
good,Laid off due to budget cuts at location I worked. Asked to come back and aquire job again. I totally understand the lay off. Will return. Great experience at location.
good,I like working in my department I just wished they wouldn’t get upset when you get sick and have to call in I love the people that work there they are very friendly and willing to help out
good,"If not for a difference of opinion with Management, I would still be there.  The job has its peaks and valleys, there are slow periods when zoning and stocking is necessar7"
good,"The store is always busy so you have to stay on your toes. It isn't extraordinarily hard but it can be overwhelming at times, especially around the holiday season."
good,"This job will provide with a liveable wage. Put up with mangers who play favoritism and crazy customers, then it is not a bad place of work. Many locations or department to choose from always helps!"
good,Interesting working there was fine but there were some bad apples and i always felt Lonely and miserable but the job itself was fine just the environment was a bit off
good,"Early to bed, early to rise, day starts early everyone normally meets at the front door, laughing and joking, we all enter the building then proceed to begin the days freight, some days are more stressful then others but over all the work experience is a good one, there are a few bad eggs in the group, that is to be expected, but the over all feel of the experience is that of a group relaying on each other in order to better themselves and the store as a whole, by teamwork and communication."
good,I very much enjoy my job as Money Center associate. A typical work day starts with counting in my draw. Making sure that the center is clean and properly stocked for the workday. My work environment is fast paced at times. Many times customers wait in line to be waited on by myself to process their payments for billers. We also cash payroll checks and sell money orders. The hardest part of the job is a lot of the time I am the only associate available to wait on the customers. The wait in line could take as much as a half hour at our busiest times of the month. I enjoy my job and have had the pleasure of meeting so many people who come in to pay their bills. I truly love that part of my job.
good,Good place to work got lots of experience with customer service working there. Lots of freindly associates who can help show you the ropes if you're struggling a bit.
good,It’s just a really quick paced environment because something is always coming and going and you just have to be able to adjust to everything happening around you
good,I think corporate needs to spend the day and work in the field instead of trying to create new ways to approach customer  and deal with employees.  They pressure floor managers to the point they dropped out.
good,Walmart has gone through many shifts in it's management and inventory structure. It is a great place for job seekers to get their foot in the door and make a manageable career out of.
good,I love this job . Very nice management they paid full all break time . I enjoy this job . All other co-workervery helpful. Envorinment is good so you not feel tired or bored
good,"you get a workout doing what i do. its a good place to start out at, the people are very nice and respectful. the hardest part would be the weather conditions, having to be out in the bitter cold and extreme heat but management looks out for our safety."
good,"Walmart is Good place to work at and fun too. I enjoyed working theee, also they have flexible hours for the students. I highly recommend students to work there."
good,"a stressful place with little pay, no matter how old you are, you will never raise your salary, the increases are too low and managers always try not to get on, they treat you badly"
good,"Every store manager and co-manager has different expectations. You have to find the most demanding manager and always have your store at that standard to be successful. I have dound that on any given day, if you can pass his check you are golden.  There are too many different expectations for different managers, no equality among them."
good,"it was an ok place to work for if your just looking for something but not long term."
good,If you have a lot of family issues or ill family memebers this is not the place for you . They need people who are absolutely dedicated to working for them at the drop of a dime
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,the hardest part of the job for one day is when working during Christmas time and on a saturday you meet many customers who are very critical about the stuff they buy and how many gift reciepts they can have for one transaction.
good,Your hours are based off how available you are throughout the week. They really push for employees to work weekends. Only problem with Walmart is everyone was to busy trying to out shin each other instead of working together.
good,nice job but they cut hours. we have lots of fun. i been with company for over 12 years. I been ask for full time hours for long time could never get them.
good,"Working at walmart has been good so far. The pay is alright for a college student like me. I learnt different things, some that were even above the position i hold.  Nothing was really too hard about the job. It's pretty straight forward. The hardest part about working at walmart is keeping up with their attendance policy."
good,Walmart has good benefits not a bad starter job for anyone teaches you customer service skills what it's like to be in a work place overall you will learn life skills to further your goals in life.
good,Walmart has always been a company that I loved to work at. I would recommend Walmart a great company to work for. Have gotten disappointed in the scheduling system being a full-time employee I seem to be getting part-time hrs. NOT SATISTIFIED AT ALL!!!
good,Walmart is a good place to work with lots of carrier opportunities.  You can easily transfer from one location to another and also within the same location.
good,The work was fun because of my job. Co-workers were always nice and fun. Managers were sometimes strick if you don't do your job correctly or if you lacked off. Overall Walmart is a good company to work for.
good,"1) Management"
good,Answer the phone and direct to the right department take care of the clothes. I learned how to multitask  better. The management is great and helpful. The workplace is fast-paced and relaxed.
good,Wanting certain hours is hard to get when you are a cashier. Lack of communication between HR personnel. The hardest part of the job is going back and getting the monthly training done.
good,The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Already ready to lend a helping hand. Good work atmosphere. The customers are loyal tipp the store and mostly a pleasure to deal with.
good,"Working for Wal*Mart allows you to learn many different aspects of customer service. A typical shift you may run the register, stock shelves, assist customers, or clean up spills."
good,In the beginning I liked working for the company Working with the associates was my favorite I'm a people person a management was good and friendly The problems that I had with the company was corporate didn't care about their sociates
good,"Un dia normal en Walmart iniciaba con una pequeña reunion en la que nos hablaban de nustros numeros del dia anterior y una pequeña motivacion para las actividades a realizar el dia en curso, despues de eso era ir a tu area de trabajo y realizar tus actividades correspondentes"
good,Walmart is a very busy place to work you are always on your feet and you have to know how to deal with many different attitude people are all different that comes into the stor to price thing so your job change as you work
good,I had trouble with how they ran the place people weren’t doing their jobs the way that they should have and I had to pick up slack and other associates had to one brought up to management they said that they are working on it which was the same thing they said three months before hand
good,"I can't say much other than my time here has been up and down. I feel like I'm just sputtering in place with nowhere to go.  The managers are cool and most of them are pretty laid back, but the lack of recognition after all my time here has definitely taken its toll."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very fast pace and very productive. "
good,Once you became a supervisor you were always on the move. Was always needed at some part of the store. There was always something to learn. Many experiences and opportunities.
good,"I work at a smaller Walmart, it is not a bad job. The people are very nice and the job has good hours (I work in the Pharmacy). I have an issue that cashiers get paid the same price as a technician. We, in my opinion, do so much more work and have peoples Lives on the line and can be affected if we mess up. That in junction with also doing what cashiers do."
good,"Good pay, easy job, friendly people, and they try to work around your schedule when they can. I liked working here. Wouldn't mind going back and working again"
good,"Was an okay workplace, just needs to understand how  -- if you're sick you should have the right to call out without getting any points put onto you. If that was the case I'd stayed."
good,"The thing is when I wanted to get in touch with my managers, they would be some where else. When they were complaining about not getting enough carts retrived... they threatened my job."
good,"I've worked for Wal-Mart for 4 years now in multiple positions. As an associate it can be hard maintaining the same amount of hours at all times, as a department manager, you're upper management will be what either makes your time there good or bad. Not a bad place to be but could be better."
good,"Pay is okay despite sometimes having to complete more tasks than others, while being paid the same wage as them. Experienced workers in the eccomerce field have the bulk of the work to handle most of the timez"
good,when working at Walmart my day consists of changing customers oil fixing flat tires and selling batteries and taking care of customers at the counter checking out
good,"Working at Walmart my typical day could always be a little different. I would go into work, clock in, find a manager and be told where to go for the day. During my shift i might be placed in several locations to do different jobs like stocking, cart pushing, returns, check outs, or door greeting. "
good,Una empresa en la que puedes crecer pero más a un largo plazo
good,"Is good not bad "
good,"Uma boa empresa. Pessoas boas, e compreensivas. Super indico"
good,some parts of the job i enjoy but many times some  management has communication issues with having you do one thing then another member of management having you do another or the opposite of the first tasks. Also having being under staff the pressure can get to you while being complained to by costumers. But pass all the that i enjoy my coworkers and the work.
good,"Not a hard job, Paid better than minimum wage and coworkers were easy to get along with. Hours were not something that could always be relied on, and the place was always short handed for staff."
good,i really enjoyed my employmernt with walmart. room for career advacement learning different jobs. managenent and coworkers were veru friendly and training on jobs were very thorough.
good,"•rules always change "
good,"nao tenho o que reclamar, aprendi muito trabalhando lá, e fui promovidas 2 vezes"
good,when I was there it was a good place to work. the positions I have held there gave the opportunity to advance and the skills to run the departments the way I wanted to
good,walmart is good to  work at once you dont into trouble or be teased at for something little. and some of the customers was being so rude to me too. i just didnt even like it at all
good,"A typical work day is assisting customers , restocking shelves with new products ,keeping sales floor clean and neat . I learned to read bar codes for items . Management was good to work with , they were understanding of employee needs. The other staff members were great to work with also. The hardest part would probably be lifting heavy items .The most enjoyable would be working with the public ."
good,The company was not bad. I just believe they should provide their employee benefits. The only way you got befits was if you worked full time and they would send me home early just so I wouldn't meet the 40 hours.
good,"This was a decent job.  Schedules got changed a few times without notice.  Understaffed.  Employees are expected to be perfect, and are not given very good training.  CBLs were the worst.  COworkers and nice customers made it worth while."
good,"good place to work and team work neccesary for the task jobs due they where timed same with breaks, a lot of work opportunities, but not for open shcedule"
good,"Friendly environment to work for. Room for advancement. There is also plenty of room to learn different roles, positions throughout the company. Good place to work for while you attending school."
good,Une bonne entreprise et je la recommande à toute personne qui aimerait faire leur carrière à walmart.
good,"If you are looking for a job to get you by between jobs or as a first job, Walmart is the place to work. Be prepared though for the Management to always have a crisis and be ready to move fast!"
good,"It was stressful at times, but it was a pretty good place to work. I did go through alot of training and felt I was prepared when I went on the floor."
good,It was very stressful they are not laid back at all u have to be very fast pace but the benefits and pay is what was so amazing about working here. If
good,Fast paced somewhat physical work. Good environment. Not great pay and limited advancement in salary. Strict with sick time but consistent hours. Good management
good,Excellent place to work with coworkers as well as customers. There was never a dull moment at Wal-Mart . there was always work to be done stocking shelves unloading trucks helping customers so it helped the day go by and was exciting and productive at the same time.
good,"Wal-Mart is a a very fast pace environment and endless opportunities! You meet so many amazing people, and so many people willing to help you grow. Learning other skills is a major thing that happens in Wal-Mart. At times it can be tough, but in the end it's a great place to move up! I was required to train other employees, keep up with my departments numbers. Such as increasing/decreasing sales numbers. Making sure everything was in stock, accounted for, and figured out ways to improve and increase my department sales. The hardest part was finding a balance between running nearly four department, and keeping the customers/management happy. As you learn, grow, and meet other people to help you. Things become easier and you find yourself excelling!"
good,You can only advance in this company if they want you too. Just because you want it does not mean it will happen. They will interview you to make it look good on their side.
good,Cashiering for Walmart really helped me open up to larger crowds and become fast paced when needed. Also had a great team to work with which made work fun
good,"Can I Walmart I did learn a lot to expand my skills and to see how Walmart operated as a family-oriented job. Also, I'm at Walmart Shopper myself so I can see both spectrum of being a customer and a server to customers. If I have an opportunity, I will go back to Walmart and give my all to the corporation."
good,"One of my favorite jobs is backroom and truck unloading, but the management was a mess and the supervisors were argumentative amongst themselves. In addition, once you complete what is considered ""Tier I"" of your training, you're supposed to receive a $1 raise, which doesn't seem like much, but trust me, it is. I was placed on the floor before I completed this Tier, which isn't unusual, but my supervisor refused to let me complete my training, and my manager didn't care that I wasn't keeping up with the track that they supposedly expect of you. I worked there for three months and never again saw the training computers. I never got that $1 raise either. Take away the negligent management and the dysfunctional system that they used as to how our day should be run, and it would be a lovely place to work. I just couldn't handle not being treated with basic respect. In the three months that I worked there, I saw half the Team I was on leave. Some went to other departments, whose jobs were less stressful and whose management was better, and others left to find other places of employment. I left to go back to school. Frankly, you can find better pay at places that treat you with decency, and that's exactly what I did."
good,"Process is done everyday also work one on one with customers, except new task and work as a team. Overall control of merchandise in depts, take care of freight, inventory levels and also markup/markdowns"
good,Fun working at Wal-Mart the other employees was easy to work with and friendly and that's what made working at Wal-Mart comfortable and the pay was Decent which is a good thing
good,"muito aprendi nesta empresa,uma empreza que da oportunidades,"
good,Good hours hard work. Nice people to work with most of the time. Always stay busy. Learned new thing mostly everyday there. Had it crazy days that were a little harder to get through with what you were left to use or who was available help.
good,"Keep shelves full and customers happy. "
good,"First get there have to find tool to do job.  Check on price changes, do price changes, answer phone, help customers with what they need, check customers out, let customers look at guns.  If a customer wants gun the customer fills out first part we fill out second part and then we do a back ground check.  If the customer passes the back ground check then we will ring up gun for customer and a manager will walk customer to front.  Stock product to shelfs, sell ammo to customer.  Hardest part of job is when the state want us to look up a gun with only the serial # and a year that it was purchased and after I find it the fax the information to the state. I love helping customer get what they was needing on their shopping day."
good,"cultura 5S"
good,I believe Walmart is for younger people who want temporary work and need some quick experience. Walmart is a great company but they don't value their employees. You can work here for 7 years or 7 months and they are still going to treat you as if you are a new hire/stranger.
good,c est pas plaisant de travailler la bas c est dure
good,A good place for college students and people who are desperate for work. Workload isn’t too heavy so it’s also not too demanding either. Would recommend to anyone
good,It was a okay work environment was not very supportive of one Another. The workplace culture was slow. The hardest part of the job was working outside.
good,Good company depending on the store and the store manager. Friendly coworkers. Relaxed. Hour lunches. Busy durning the holidays. It’s definitely not for everyone but for people like me it was nice.
good,"Walmart is a fast paced work environment that is constantly changing.  It has a competitive wage for entry level positions.  It has a fantastic benefits package that includes, medical, dental, vision, short and long term disability, life, ADD insurance, matching 401k and stock options.  They also have their own learning Academy for anyone who promotes to a leadership position.  Walmart offers a $1 a day online college degree program for Business Mgmt."
good,It can be a temperate role or you can make it into a career that’s fun not just for you but for everyone that works under you. It isn’t for everyone but when you find the right area to work in it can be pretty great.
good,"it was a decent part time job. I enjoyed the overall experience, although with a newborn baby it did not cover my cost of living. I also was not giving as many hours as I would have liked."
good,"a typical day at "
good,It's a great job the associates are great  but some of the managers are too much. It was hard for me to do the work because of management og my last year of working there was one of the hardest.
good,Looking for employments I chose to try to learn Retail as a new direction to my skills. I was interesting to learn with very little direction so mistakes I made were quickly learned and not repeated. I found it easy to make friends and worked well with the team. This I felt was because of my time with the Cruise industry. As hours were cut I asked to be moved to Produce and learned hard work by lifting and moving items in and out of storage. It was a good place to work and the company treated me very well
good,They give myshare-which is like extra free money for working there after around 9 months.  Hours are good. Management is pretty strict. Pick favorites but that’s  How it is everywhere. It’s a pretty good  work place I liked it.
good,"Good paying job for the area with good benefits that you have to pay for. Things I didn't like were raises and other things were the same for everybody and were based on time, hard to stand out because there are so many employees. Just feel like another number and to move up to management is difficult and possibly not worth it because the hours managers have with their salary."
good,"I worked for two different stores as a fulfillment associate and then in the customer value team. One company, two different stores - two different philosophies. Everything depends on your coworkers and management. One store can be messy, another one can be very neat. Also, you can work very hard unloading trailers, pooling skids, stocking, picking, binning inside of the deep freezer (-23C) or doing nothing just walk around as guys from electronics usually do and you both will get exactly the same paychecks. Yep, this is not good, but if you a smart guy or lady you can talk to your manager and ask for a transfer to another dept. And your life will be much much better. My second store was 5* stars Walmart due to the good store manager and nice people but I found I was very hard to survive earning almost a minimum wage... Perfect part-time job to save some extra money but as a full time you have to work 7 days straight/2 days off/3 days on, unpaid holidays. That what it is) But I like Walmart, overall it is a decent company, especially for newcomers. Good luck!"
good,If you are looking for a job that is fast pace Walmart is the job for you. They give you the hours your looking for if your willing to work and your flexibile.
good,I enjoyed being a cashier and service desk associate. I liked meeting new people and interacting with them. I learned a lot about marketing techinques.
good,"I loved my job and would still be there if my job had not been phased out. I learned a lot of valuable information there and made many friends. My responsiblities included daily deposit verification, paperwork and researching long and shorts in the daily operations of the registers.  "
good,"Sales Floor is very fast paced. Constant zoning, assisting customers and assisting in product relocation (features, end caps and action alley products are always constantly moved). Additionally, you are required to assist in other areas, for example I was very consistently required to assist Fabrics/Crafts. "
good,"Walmart has a lot of career growing potential for associates. It is a hard working job. You want to succeed you have to work hard, be there, and communicate."
good,"Handle money, take care/assist customers, keep a neat work environment, move at a fast paced while still properly taking care of a customer, being customer friendly is also a role in my job as being a cashier ."
good,A good place to work if the mangers didnt play favorites good hours decent pay for to much of a work load better pay would help and nicer mangers give it a 7 to work there
good,"Working for Walmart was rewarding, hours and pay follow your work ethics and openness to advance, Walmart has a little for everyone with many opportunities in so many different areas of the store. Customer flow can be overwhelmingly at times."
good,"The job was just temporary, but they don't know how to fire useless employees. I was well trained but can't stand a lot of the helpless customers. I enjoyed the job overall"
good,getting oriented when you get their finding out what needs to be done other then normal routine for the most management is good a family atmosphere trying to work short handed the customer
good,Receiving and unloading the walmart  trucks it as a fast past work place and fun at the samtime learning how to package in stock and I learned how to operate a forklift
good,It's a solid 8 hour job that provides plenty of benefits are available. Retail however is still retail and depending on your position it can be hit or miss.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer thanks you for the excellent customer service you provided or for all the hard work that they see you putting in.
good,It was a decent job for me because I was young at the time. The minimum pay was around $10. It was a fair balance for my social life and school life. Everyone was nice as well.
good,"I worked in the grocery part of the store. I stocked items, rotated stock, checked in freight, answered costumer questions. Broke down boxes for recycling, kept the isles clear of obstructions, clean up spills and generally keep the store looking nice."
good,Strictly 8 hrs a day at the time i was there was not very encouraging. Sometimes was required to work pass scheduled hours only to be sent home early the next day to avoid overtime. Co-workers are very cooperative though management on the other hand seemed very unreasonable
good,"Shifts are long and boring, like working in a factory. No chance to communicate with other employees. Breaks and benefits are very nice, along with bonuses and flexibility."
good,"Every department had its ups and downs, the customers can be really rude and sometimes management will stick up for you, but for the most part, if you are just a normal associate, tough luck. There is a lot of drama, naturally coming from such a large store, and a lot of the managers are prone to getting big heads. However, my supervisor on the front end was by far the best employer I had."
good,"So far, Walmart has been an enjoyable place to work.  I like everyone that I work with.  The only draw back is the fact that hours are cut back so much during the winter."
good,I worked in tle and it wasn’t bad as long as I did my job and did it right you can fit in. If you like working with cars than this is a area that can definitely get you started.
good,It was a fun job but your constantly on your feet. I loved meeting new people all day! A lot of them were super sweet! You get small break but they aren’t paid
good,"This is the only company that I have ever worked for. I have learned all that I know about retail and about what it takes to be a good leader from this company. The management team is exceptional. Everyone is really close, its like we have become family."
good,"A typical day at work would usually go by smoothly and quickly. Any problems with customers or spills, etc. Were really with quickly and efficiently. If I need help with anything, help came with just a few minutes, and the majority of customers left happy."
good,"Ótimos Benefícios aos funcionários, Possibilidades de crescimento na empresa."
good,The only issue I had with Walmart is the hours. There needs to be a better distribution of hours during the day shifts. If there are enough hours given along with opportunities the turn over rate would be lower...
good,"Walmart has a lot of unnecessary stress from management and home office.  Home Office often sets unreasonable goals, such as 10,000 price changes in one day, then management expects one to get them out of the system, encouraging you to process them without working them, if necessary.  Process changes coming from home office were sometimes unworkable on the sales floor, yet the people who tried to explain that were fired for being ""resistant to change"". Later the program would be abandoned because it didn't work.  As a manager, you were encouraged to agree to get along rather than report real results, and to push bad results down to your subordinates and write them up, rather than fix the problems."
good,"Was very fast paced. Which I enjoy. They training program was long, but excellent. They helped immensely once I worked on the floor. Thanks only thing I didn't like, was they kept changing my schedule."
good,Opción de trabajo de jornada de 18 horas (fin de semana).
good,Overall good place to work. good relationships can be built between hourly and management. Hours for salary can be long during holiday seasons and inventory time.
good,Walmart wasn’t a bad experience for me because it helped me with a lot of my work skills and customer service. Others may not enjoy Wal-Mart however I found it made me a better worker
good,The pay is good and there was never a shortage of hours. You also get pretty sweet bonuses if your store rates them.The insurance was good but nothing super cheap. And you get discounts in the store
good,I enjoyed Walmart. I moved up to you Dept manager in six months. I loved toys because I love kids. The two years I was manager in toys our store and my Dept was number one sales nationwide both years.
good,"Muy buena amistad entre los trabajadores, se aprende mucho del lugar de trabajo"
good,Very good for someone who just needs money through school. It is a very laid back place and they are very willing to work with your college schedule to get you hours and not overwhelm you.
good,Working there gave me the opportunity to build skills and afford the choices to progress in the retail field. The general atmosphere of working there was an uncompetitive environment with awesome employee culture to embrace.
good,Great place to work. Always learned something new each day. Ability to grow within the company. Enjoyed working with a different variety of cultures. Always had a morning or afternoon meeting to update on how the company was doing and what the goals were for that day. Managers would ask for volunteers to help in different areas periodically and knew who they could rely on. Thats how i managed to discover almost every area of the store. Make yourself available for change more times than not.
good,The job overall taught me a lot about working in a high demand/stress workplace. Management were never on one accord with certain things. They would bring personal issue into the workforce. Highlighted teamwork as a major role while working here.
good,Always have your daily tasks that have to happen in daily routines.  Included were always unforeseen tasks that rise from  different obstacles that happened throughout the day. Change is the key to Walmart environment.  Adapting to change is key to Walmart success. With either different ways to improve daily tasks or environmental changes like online and delivery (ecommerce) programs.
good,It was a great Company to work for. they care about you until they don't. I learned a lot from them and enjoyed about 80 percent of working there.....
good,"É uma boa Empresa para trabalhar, valoriza muito o funcionário"
good,"stressful environment, easily managed by working in teams to split work load and stress. Management not the best at following up and resolving work place conflicts."
good,"Active schedules"
good,"Loved working cap 2 but physically demanding"
good,"I loved to work at Walmart, I got along with everyone. The company would give good bonuses every 3 months, we would get 10 percent off online or in the store, you get 2 fifteen minutes breaks and a hour lunch, and the company had great benefits such as medical, dental, vision, and 401 ."
good,"Is a nice place to work at , is friendly, fast pace, it give you the opportunity to leaned and grow an different department , I love work at Walmart  . Is a friendly place"
good,"Good company. Good benefits. A very diverse culture.  Enjoyed working with the poeple I worked with. Just as long as you stay on task, the day goes by quickly."
good,"Usually a busy day with lots of interaction."
good,There are lots of other employees to interact with. There’s also a lot of customers everyday to socialize with while they shop at Walmart. Wish benefits were available earlier then they are.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, a day usually consists of running the cash register and stocking/zoning shelves.  I learned to zone shelves, stock shelves, operate a pallet jack, run the cash register and to do layaway.  Management was poor for the most part, they didn't give much direction and were not understanding, some managers were better.  The work environment was fast paced sometimes but mostly laid back, it was mostly individual work with some team work.  The hardest part of the job was when the register lines got backed up.  The most enjoyable part was the freedom."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era bueno en todo el personal del supermercado, son amables y se te respeta tu tiempo de comida y descanso "
good,I really loved the people i worked with when i was a support manager at my old store. When i advanced as an assistant Manager and switched locations thats when things became to difficult and frustrating and i wasnt able to transfer back or step back down which really upset me. I learned alot from my mentor and appreciate all the time and dedication they put into me in making me become a better leader.
good,"Poderia oferecer mais benefícios, oportunidades e mais vivência da cultura."
good,"Easy paced job with great employees"
good,The time that I spent working for Walmart I can say that the best part was the people that I had the pleasure of working alongside. Because we all worked together and as a team.
good,"Walmart is a great company with great benefits from a manager's prospective. A typical work day is overcoming the challenges of staffing to meet the demands of the work. I've learned to focus on what's most important and what would produce bottom line results. Managing was fun, challenging, and a learning experience for a wide range of different entities. The work place culture is team spirited, and you get a sense/ feel of a family environment. The hardest part of the job was the physical demand for example, lifting, standing for long periods of time, and working 12-14 hours per day. In ending, the most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to work with a large group of diverse associates, and seeing their growth from the training/ development they received."
good,"Walmart got me started in the working field, they were not a bad place to start. People were friendly most days, others not so much but the experience wasn't terrible."
good,"All ways were keep busy, how to run a cash register, stock product on the shelf, loved working with my managers, standing on my feet all night, people that I worked with"
good,"Everyday you know what the expectations consisted of in order to accomplish the companies goals "
good,"An employee can learn as much as that want, advance within the company to get promoted into both an hourly and/or salary positions. Training is available for new changes that happens within the com[any daily."
good,"love working at Walmart I meet people all kind of people learn some thing new everyday it,s a great place for long term work Im not leaving Walmart  just looking for extra work."
good,"Days were very busy and very productive, from answering phone calls from associates on the dock to helping associates in break pack consolidation.Running and clearing jams in the cranes and on lines to keep freight flowing.Auditing shipping containers to make sure stores were getting proper freight, pulling freight to return to sender."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. The pay was good compared to other jobs in the area. The hours varied tremendously from.8 per week to 32 and I was part time. The discount wasn't that great. It only applies to certain items and was 10%.
good,"Working at Walmart is a pretty good way to improve teamwork and social skills. Stocking the freight is only a part of the job, the main focus is making sure the customer is satisfied with the experience. Often times, stockers will work in pairs or small groups to accomplish tasks that would be too difficult for one person. At times, customers will ask for help and having two workers present not only increases the odds that the customer will be helped, but it also allows one worker to keep working freight while the other helps the customer."
good,"Every order to be filled is given a predetermined time to be completed. "
good,"All jobs have ups and downs. I loved my management team, employees. My only reason for leaving was because I am a single mom, and struggled to pay the bills. Found employment that paid more. Also, had a personal issue with a peer. Wasn't worth the stress."
good,Most associates are friendly and make work fun. Easy to learn. Tasks are easy to perform. Walmart is awesome with days you need off or if you want to pick up depending on what department.
good,Working in the Houseware Area was great very easy laid back job help assist customers when needed. Keep area super clean for apeear purposes and was also offered a Lead position in Housewares.
good,It was my first job relocating cities a temporary easy job just to get started and provided a constant income to get my family started and on our feet.
good,"Work day is fast paced and piece per hour requirement. Power equipment operations, with testing. Management support at a high level. Relaxed but sometimes stressful work environment.Hardest part of the job was a mixed trailer, combined sorting with different power equipment,hand sorting and hand stacking.Most enjoyable was a straight load on pallets that required minimal breakdown."
good,"A lot of wonderful co-workers. People work together to get things done. However, some cashiers need to work on their attitudes towards customers as well as co-workers."
good,Walmart Distribution was my first job in Mississippi and it was a great opportunity for me to become the person I am today. They showed me how to properly work a fortlift.
good,"work well in a team palyer. able to  mul-titask. Positive attitude and good communication skills. Good leadership, Always 15 minute before shift starts."
good,"i gain leadership, intense working environment   "
good,"I mainly just overlooked other employees, and dealt with the customer, The hardest part was dealing with unfriendly customers, "
good,"They listen when you ask for specific departments they want you to seceded. people are mostly friendly mangers are knowledgeable"
good,great working at Walmart. the coworker work as a team and friendly with others. the management is considerant of the worker personal life. They move you around to other department so you can learn more.
good,"If you want overtime, this is the job for you. The stress of some departments is overwhelming. Management pushes for you to take half a lunch, stay late, etc, but complains when there is overtime."
good,Typically a day would go by slowly due to the nature of the job. I didn't have to interact with the customers as often as i would have expected. Management was very good a dealing with any issues that arose. The only complaint was the the way the schedule was set up left no time to anything apart from work.
good,My duties at Walmart had me interacting with customers and exerting myself through tasks like unloading trucks and pushing carts from corrals back to the store
good,"I truly loved my job here , and u wouldn't mind going back but I need a job that's only a few hours a day I have a new baby y , and Walmart wants u to work hours"
good,"Es una empresa en la que vale la pena laborar, sin embargo es un lugar para crecer y seguir avanzando después"
good,In customer service for financial company always have to look out for customer scams. make sure ideas being check all times for check cashing. managing breaks and look over the cashiers. make sure all work being done by the end of shifs.
good,"Quick paced working environment, flexible working hours, coworkers are easy to get along with, the management is very organized, the number of hours I received was reasonable."
good,"Worked three days out of the week (weekends) while going to college. Pay was more than enough for a college student. Work was like a 12 hour workout so I got in really good shape. Management was great, advancement opportunities were available and extreme focus on safety."
good,I ENJOY MY JOB WITH WALMART CANADA. GREAT company to work for. always promoting their staff.yearly profit sharing. flexable shifts. great training good management
good,"Es un buen lugar lugar para trabajar,te desarrollas como persona"
good,For this position I did basic cart pushing and helped with customer carry outs I find this job to be very fast paced but fun at the same time had a great time working with management was difficult.
good,"Days as a Cap 2 associate usually starts with unloading grocery trucks. After that we would stock until our lunch break. Then, we will stock for the rest of the day."
good,it was nice to meet and know the variety of people that worked or shopped at walmart. The associates I worked with were great. most of the upper management I could have done without
good,"walmart was a nice place to work, i like the people i worked with but managment was very disorganized and the pay was not enough for the work and no benefits"
good,"Very high paced job loved "
good,This is not a bad job.  I took the job with the hope to move up.  I happen to be placed in a department that does very will but they don't like to move good people out of the department.  This contributed to my not being considered for promotion.
good,Overall I did have a good experience working at walmart because I learned different skills that will help me in future jobs.  I learned how to regulate my sleep and be able to work any hours I needed to work.  I also made lifelong friends at the store and was unhappy I had to leave.
good,"Respetar el horario laboral"
good,"aside from a few lazy co workers the job was pretty great, managers where bad about picking favorites and letting them do absolutely nothing while other people picked up their slack"
good,"It was really good to work there. I worked with them for nine years. I am comfortable with the work I did. "
good,Working with customer only daily basic. Co-workers and CSM was easy going. The downfall is you couldn't leave register to get Price check or help a customer out to find item especially when the customer can't find assist.
good,"You'll see most people enjoy it. Depends on your outlook of Walmart. Training takes a long time.  Advancement opportunities, tuition reimbursement, great philosophy"
good,"I did what they asked me to do to the best of my ability, was polite, helpful and had a good attitude and everything was fine. They encourage people to act professionally, which is a good thing!"
good,"I worked at walmart for a relatively short time. Let go not because of work performance but because of the companies policy on sick days. It was a good enough place to work but my health issues, which at the time weren't properly monitored by a doctors, got in the way. We got a good amount of time for lunches (on full shifts at least) and my store had a lot of sort of pot luck events."
good,"A typical day at work is signing in at beginning of shift and start pulling in carts from parking lot to designated area in the store.  Helping customers if they need to load or unload something from their vehicle.  Working in inclement weather and being on your feet constantly.  I enjoy my job at Walmart however there is not a lot of room for advancement and I would like to try other job opportunities not only for the financial aspect but to work as a team and help others.  Hardest part of the job is being able to maneuver the carts around the vehicles and having people remember that the machine can only go so fast and that I will do what I can to not inconvenience them in any way.  I was hit by a car at work because the person did not look behind them when I was trying to load carts in the parking lot; I am fine but that is the hardest part of my job, safety at all times is the key.  The management at Walmart is great, they are friendly and like to help when they can."
good,During a typical work day you will face a standard work load based upon the needs of the stores in the network.  There are plenty of breaks for you to be able to catch your breath.
good,"I enjoyed my co workers, they were always willing to help, espicially when I was new. I saw this continue as other new team members started as well."
good,Good job just need better  management but the overall job is good the manager I just can’t  deal with I  recommend this job if you can was going in in the job
good,"I enjoy helping people and I meet a variety of different people."
good,I like how I was alone dining my own job and how the people were so nice and welcoming. I loved climbing up ladders with a heavy load and running the power pallet jack was a good experience.
good,"ability to adapt to change in a face pace,need to be a team player and be able to move up and down ladders with ease, All aspects of hands and vison is required"
good,"Can be stressful at times. Doing the job of 5 people with very little assistance. Can be a good place to work at with the right people. Properly staffed, happy employees."
good,I worked in the deli for almost a year and then moved over to online groceries where I would go through the store and pick customer's orders. I did that for a couple months then moved to night time general merchandice which involved me stocking freight and working back stock. I did this till I left to finish school
good,Responsibilities as management is over seeing my whole area/department. Making sure my signage is accurate and clean. Taking care of my out of date product's.
good,"As a cashier i rang up products for the customers and collected the required payment, some days where slow with a few customers every 10 minutes while it can get as busy as entire lines each filled to the brim with items."
good,"I worked on the maintenance team cleaning the entire store everyday, processing freight and filling inventory.  I also had customer service duties when the store was open during the day."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, but the mangers have there favorites and if your not a favorite then your on there. people there can be nice but they don't care if you have family issues they want you at work"
good,Work was relaxed and lay'd back. There was some days that where overwhelming but they were manageable. Wish there was more work hours and overtime. management was great though.
good,"A typical day of work would be me being a fast pace cashier. Meet and greet customers. Also having great customer service. I learned how to scan, ring up or look up product information. Management for this company was very fair. Very diverse work place. The hardest part of the job would be when there wasn't enough cashiers and the lines got really long. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and making sure that their trip that day was a very satisfying one."
good,"Always looking out for the customer. Ready to help when needed. Made sure staff was safe for the overnight shift. Hard to advance though. Wouldn't mind though, working for them."
good,I didn't had much fun working with Walmart. My manager from front was always rude. Even if I had a family emergency she would never believe my excuses.
good,"fulltime is not actually fulltime because the hours get cut often"
good,It is a good place to break into the world of work for a new comer to Canada. A friendly place with a very strong customer oriented corporate culture.
good,Job description was not clear and 9-10 working hours/6 days in a week. Company was not flexible with urgent situations. Working hours were good during peak season of taxation period.
good,"It's like any other retail place. All the same not hard work, but can be stressful and fun at times, great co-workers there, and very bright environment."
good,"Walmart was a very fast paced and fun employer. Benefits were great, I was always scheduled my full time hours. I had opportunity for growth and advancement."
good,"Hired on with little experience was treated as a boon; clean slate to be taught the specifics of Walmart policy, i.e. The Walmart way. Gained knowledge and became an effective part of the Tire Lube and Express team."
good,All of the managers and the personnel were very nice and willing to work with you if you went to school. If you want to get your GED they will help you get it.  They give you a pay raise once you finish your training which is usually about 90 days.
good,"Each store is different. The store I work at has a few issues that I'm sure many other stores have, but overall the time I have spent here has been pretty decent. The health insurance benefits are good and the associate discount has saved me a dime or two here and there. I have also met some fellow associates that I am grateful to call friends, and a few customers that brighten my day each time they come to shop."
good,Walmart is a well rounded job. Management is not too strict. It pays well. Good benefits. They take the time to train you in you're department. Walmart is well-organized when dealing with their associates.
good,"The job itself is not hard if you have decent work ethics, however managers and clients can seriously make or break your experience. All the benefits are fantastic, Walmart insurance is great but if you have a bad manager you’ll hate every moment of it with how stressed it will make you."
good,I worked 3rd shift 3rd shift You could get your job done faster cause you didn't have to deal with the customers On 2nd shift They did a terrible  job most of the time cause they had to deal with the customers  I really enjoyed working there
good,"Wal-Mart was lot of fun , my typical day at work would be like I would cut vegetables or fruits, then place them in the department, i would clean the department, chat with customers, my colleagues, the managers were understandable."
good,A typical day at work consisted of fast paced work. It was a daily unsettling example for a lot of employees that didn't want to work their schedules.
good,"Always working, barely anytime not to be working. If you are not doing your job there is something else that needs to be done and is always being needed. Some days you would be prepared for customer service and wear a button up and they would put you on the lot because lack of personnel. Always a learning environment and offered good advancement if you knew the right person."
good,Walmart has a diverse group of employees and for the most part everyone gets alone. There are four shifts available. You have the opportunity ton invest in their stock when you are filling out your hire paperwork.
good,"It was a nice place to work, with its mild working pace and comfortable atmosphere. I have learned how to operate powered machinery as well as basic equipment. When I worked there the managers were nice and understanding of the there associates while also knowing how to work themselves."
good,"Productive and fast paced work environment which required people skills, a good attitude and helped to mold my character as a worker even for a first job"
good,"My typical day at work consists of being friendly with customer, checking out items at register, re stocking front end items, re shops, cleaning out registers, zoning, stocking,and folding clothes.I learned how to fold clothes neatly in a timely manner, how to use a register, and how to bag properly. The hardest part of the job is having constant pressure to keep up with the hectic work place and management. I really enjoy talking with customers and making them smile."
good,I would love to move up in the company. But there are so many reasons for why you couldn't be acknowledge to move up. I work very hard and want to move up.
good,Liked working there want to again i hope to work there again and soon excellent crew and peoplw there were nice to me and my family dont change anything
good,Nice place to work and served. the public . Also. Meeting people from out of town they always stop in or sleep overnite in the parking lot .Showing customer what they looking. for . Black Friday is always a big event.
good,This job was a boon. wasn't very taxing unless you worked the back room. Very willing to notice hard for and effort. everyone was very nice and patient with the new hires
good,It’s the healthiest work environment I’ve ever been in. Everyone is excited to see me and I’m told I’m doing well daily. I’m congratulated on a good job.
good,They care about you and will work with you if you need help or you have a family emergency. They will team with you and find the best solution to the issue.
good,this job was a great working experience. i learned a lot within this company and grew my training within every chance i got.  i worked with many crews and learned to support and improve my team member's when i had the chance. i worked close with my inventory team on a daily basis to make sure we were not getting merchandise that would not sell and keeping our store numbers up and inventory levels down.  i worked with  my invoicing clerk also on a regular basis to keep track of invoices and issues that would occur with other outside company's. i ran daily reports to show where we stand and issue arose to take care of them as fast as we could.
good,"Overall a great place to work, some stores are ran differently than others. Not a good work/ life balance.  To work for this company you have to learn to delegate and control your stress under pressure."
good,"Walmart pays about $10-$11 starting pay. Checks were bi-weekly. The work environment could be slow-paced and relaxed on slow business days but could get intense and stressful on fast-paced business days."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart. The management could be a little better, but overall it was a great working environment.You get a hour lunch and two fifteen minute breaks when you work over six hours."
good,Biased and favoritism toword daytime associates make it hard to advance. Work is stressful at times and you can get burnt out. Because you work at night and sleep during the day there is not much life outside of work.
good,Was excited to be offered a full time job at Walmart DC. Good pay and not to bad on hr schedule.  I would still be there if it wasnt one manager on the job that didnt know how to manage.
good,I wish I could of got more hours for the rate I was paid and wish work was more sturdy and maybe more benefits also more breaks would been nice all and all a good place to work
good,It is a great job it’s high paced and you have to be willing to catch one Fast. management lacks but it has its ups and downs. Definetly a great job to grow with.
good,"walmart was actually one of my favorite jobs. i would have liked to work there longer if i could have. i like that every day was different i was always busy doing something. some days i was on the register, some days i was in customer service, or money center or like one day i was in electronics. that was a very stressful day. I like almost everyone i worked with but management was not the best. but i was trained to do most jobs in the store which I really liked. I was really good at my job there."
good,The most enjoyable part was satisfying the customers needs. The hardest part was being understaffed specially during the holidays to fill orders. Workplace was fast paced when busy. Management was geat
good,"Started the day off by inspecting and preparing the machines before beginning the workload. Serving customers and working on their vehicles. "
good,"great place to start off.  benefits for full time. profit sharing for all employees. discount card and 15% off coupons at Christmas."
good,"a typical day for me was working on 3 different reports, A meeting with top management and helping with orderfilling duties."
good,The people were nice to work with however communication between higher ups could be improved. The scheduling system sometimes was a little unfair in scheduling shifts at a minimum 8 hours apart.
good,competative workplace for goal minded people. but very difficult to advantance at certion stores.  i have favorable reaction to working there if the pay and advancement was easier to do.
good,all members of staff where kind and fun to work with. Great enviroment and place to relax. Always had events with employees like a company BBQ and picnics at teh park and just good people and fun times
good,"Walmart has been part of my life for almost 17 years."
good,It was really fun working there and my co-workers were a lot of fun to work with. We joked around a lot while we did our work and had fun with the customers while we got their orders made. Sometimes after hours when we were cleaning we didn't always get done on time and got home really late. Our managers and support managers were really good about helping us if we needed it or finding help for us. It would get harder when someone didn't show up for work leaving us alone at times. The most fun I had was when customers would tell us stories about their travels or life in general and would come back again and again for our good service.
good,"Walmart has definitely taught and trained me for the retail world. Walmart helps out their community which I’m proud to be apart of. We have many programs for the associates ex: my share bonuses, 401, stock buy in."
good,"Walmart has done an excellent job of taking care of their hourly associates. The attendance policy is very liberal, as is the open door policy.  There has been a tremendous amount of focus put on taking care of hourly associates."
good,"I loved working at Walmart! I just relocated so I will definitely re apply to work at another! Great work environment, fun and friendly people. Management could use some work when it comes to Respecting other employees"
good,The environment is very positive and productive. Walmart is a company that will work with you and your schedule. There are many benefits and opportunities.
good,"Set up for the days appointments. sign in on the computer, then check in product, and get daily reports.  As patients come in have them fill out paperwork and start the preliminary exam for the optometrist. after seeing the doctor, consult patient on best eye wear if any needed to fit their lifestyle. then file chart back into proper location."
good,"Had good coworkers that I worked with, if you stayed with the company long enough, there was opportunity to move up in the company. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customer demands."
good,Walmart would be a good place to work for younger people without families and with more flexible schedules. However the pay is decent for pretty much everyone.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart beside a few management staff. it was a nice environment, especially around the holidays, and the pay was worth the work."
good,"Growth and advancement are there however they were always trying to hire new employees and get new ones. As one who grew with the company the hiring process was almost too easy and would hire individuals that struggled to cause others to dislike one another."
good,High pace and high activity always be ready to work but still enjoy the work you do. Working for Wal-Mart has open my eyes and taught me a lot. I am confident in my abilities and the person I bring to the table because I push for knowledge and this company has always provide it. Careers are made here!
good,"My typical day at Walmart was very busy. I learned if you treat a customer with respect, that individual or family would rather have you as their cashier. The hardest of the job was standing in the same place for so long. The most enjoyable moment was meeting new faces."
good,Walmart has always been an option for me due to the fact that its a great place of work espevially if youre tryin to get yourself together with quickness.
good,"Picking when required."
good,Great to learn how to multitask and learn customer service skills . Hours fluctuate especially after holiday season. Very helpful staff and good learning environment but can be a bit hectic
good,My time at walmart gave me a chance to meet new people serve them to the best of my knowledge the people are great the staffing is more well put together with a team that really care about what you really want and need and they are willing to go above and beyond for your needs
good,it was a day by day battle because the walmart i worked at was pretty new so there was a lot of adjustments to be made but we always found a way to get it done
good,"was my first job.  advanced into hourly management quickly.  had to do a lot with little help  training was descent.  communication was ok, could have been better"
good,Walmart has good  benefit annual bonuses great hours always room for advancement there is always something to do at Walmart weather it’s cashiering stacking deli meat department there’s always something to do so that will keep you busy and make your time go by faster and easier There is Walmarts all over the world so if you do move you can relocate that’s always a plus
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart,  great associates and management at my store,  I liked meeting and assisting the customers sending them on their way with a smile and an overall positive experience with Walmart."
good,"Walmart is not a bad job to start out with. I came from another job to get a position here, and everything about this job was pretty fitting, but with a short life due to circumstances.  You learned a lot about the position you chose. Certain positions were more stressful than others, however. The hardest part about being an associate in general is not knowing the store, or understanding what's going on, because you will find that new employees may need more help than others. You get a pretty comfortable fit being a part of the company and all that is with it. The staff are not bad, nobody slacks off, everyone gets everything they can done just like any other job."
good,I enjoy working with my supervisor she was very open and understanding she was caring person and a people person.we had to do a little work out before we started our shift and talk about how we felt about our job.
good,"Great energy but long hours, worked most holidays, low pay for the work required, low annual raises. Quarterly bonuses were always something to look forward to."
good,"I pushed carts all day long and help customers with items to their cars. The heat was too much sometimes. There wasn’t someone standing over your shoulder to yelling at you if you did not do something right. But there are cameras watching you so you do have to be on top of your work. They gave us free water. There was a lot of freedom due to that you only had one job....pushing carts and using the machine. On busy days, there would be lack of electric carts, and you always have to be on a mission to find one for someone. Almost got hit by a few cars too, but I was careful. Sometimes I would be the only one to take care of all the carts for an hour due to lack of people or people leaving."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to start for your first job, pays well and will work with you on your schedule if you have school or another job. Sometimes working at Walmart can get a bit crazy around the holidays including Black Friday."
good,"Always help a customer no matter what the situation is, always find a solution."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wal*Mart, but it was cut too short when my store closed. My co-workers were my family and the pace was perfect for me. The customers I came into contact with became like family as well."
good,I had a busy day daily at Walmart.  I unloaded the truck when I first arrived then I stocked grocery department.  I learned how to work under pressure.  We had to have our isles stocked within a certain time frame or were unable to leave.  So that taught me how to time manage efficiently.  The culture of the workplace is were the company falls short and was the hardest part of the job.
good,"I worked in the electronics center and a typical day would be me stocking all they electronic items suck as Phones, Laptops, Video Games, Cameras, Gaming  systems, TVs, and movies. I would also help many customers purchase and activate their phones. I have learned patience , a how to be leader and take charger, and how to manage my time. Management was great they help me when I didn't understand, and they were nice. The work culture was good, employees did their jobs, kept their department clean, and some smiled not all but some did have a genuine smile on their faces. The hardest part of the job was being patience. Many foreign people would come with to buy a phone and I couldn't understand anything they would say and that's really difficult cause something they would be here for about an hour or two. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around all the video games and talking to people about them. I have played many games and it is really cool talking to customers about them something, knowing their opinion."
good,The team at my location cannot be replaced. The crew really made it a fun place to work and a hard place to leave. Management was lacking in passion and drive.
good,"It was better than I thought, I liked the people. It wasnt too hard nor too easy, I liked how you met different people everyday. If i had the chance to work at Walmart again i would."
good,"its not a bad place to work if you can handle the stress they throw at you, and the very fast paced type of work environment. the way customers can treat you can be good  and bad."
good,It’s was hard to get use to but after you get to know the other workers there you’ll fit in a bit better just for the first month or so just kinda keep to your self and do your work and then you’ll be fine
good,Walmart hired me on the spot when I needed a job. It was great experience learning new skills and training. I worked with some great people and made some friends. They train you in all areas of marketing and e-trade.
good,"I worked directly with the cashiers, looking after them and taking care of the money up front related to the tills and courtesy. I worked very closely with customers helping to solve any problem or concern that they had."
good,"A great job for some decent money great people to work with has good benefits, discounts, paid time off , good job to work on your customer service skills"
good,"The management department is filled with snobby people who look down upon anyone who is not taking home a salary."
good,Consistent scheduling recently being implemented is the biggest plus. Many managers to help you when customers have unanswerable questions. Learned efficiency and how to go about my day consistently to allow the day to pass on much faster.
good,The work was very fast paced and kept employees busy. Sometimes we worked in pairs it was up to us just as long as the work was getting done. I was also in different positions occassionally as the bosses taught me how to do multiple jobs.
good,"I worked in Walmart's Distrobution and Logistics as a Quality Assurance Associate.  I was effectively a boogeyman that came along behind other employees to check for mistakes.  It was fun, but dangerous and chaotic, and I had to be one part human calculator, one part cop, one part cleanup crew.  The hours are long and the warehouse goes from whatever temp it is outside to -20 degrees, which you have to  move from one area to another.  It was heck on my sinuses."
good,"A good place to work, but management is not typically clear and direct which is somewhat disconcerting.  Also worked as a cashier which was very enjoyable."
good,Typical day of work would depend on the area of the store assigned. For the most part it was always focused on keeping the customer informed and happy with their visit.
good,This is my first entry level job in Automotive I gained the general consensus on how to perform the job by working here. Awesome grateful for the ability to learn a skill at such a young age when I worked there
good,Great place if you need a job.  If you bust your butt you'll move up.  I worked for a year and a half before I hit the tip of the hourly associate pay scale.  Most people who complain about Walmart are the people who do not want to work.
good,"Not bad work place, just strict when it comes to occurrences. Come on time they don’t play when you’re a new hire. Provides benefits only for full time employees and it hard being full time"
good,"A typical day of working is mindless and somewhat boring. But it's not particularly a bad thing. You interact with a lot of people and they are often times quite friendly. It was my first job and I was set on spending more than a month there. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Walmart Auto Care Center for the year that I was there, it was a pretty friendly work environment and the pay was great. The only thing I didn't like was the ever changing schedule and lack of consistency therein."
good,"Walmart is honestly a great place to work; the benefits are great, the policies and work are easy to follow and the leniency is hard to beat.  I have worked for the company three separate times and would do so again."
good,I liked working at Walmart because it was like you could go anywhere and still be helping customers just the love of helping customers and seeing them smile makes me happy
good,The system for scheduling needs to be updated. The company itself is amazing. I Love the atmosphere. The manager is nice and works with his staff. They want to see us do great and get promoted.
good,Perfect for working on school breaks or part time with another job. They work with whatever schedule that you bring to them. If there are any problems they work with you to solve them
good,They should be paying more for employees.  The pay per each person is no accurate with accordance to their job code. Overall it is a decent job.  They make it hard to move up because they cut positions and hire so many people.  They can't keep people there.
good,"A typical day at work was like a slow -placed "
good,"Walmart was my first job after i moved to America, so everything was new for me . But i had good customer service managers so they help me to katch up things easily. it was the place i learned a lot of products and  produces we carrier on our store,  so it is my first impression in working environment."
good,The job wasn't bad but the management needs work . The job is very easy and straight forward. We were short staff so it slowed down work on some days.
good,Even though they get sometimes lazy to work with your schedual is still a good place to work staff is friendly work environment is actually pretty good.
good,"Schedule was made a month in advance and it was hard to plan that far in advance, medical issues weren't addressed. It was a good job if you can focus solely on it."
good,"Checking out customers."
good,"It varies on what days you work and if its a holiday. There will be assignments assigned to you from the other mangers on a computer. you have until the end of your shift to get it all finished. you have 2 15 minute breaks, and an an hour lunch, with the way i was working over nights. I enjoyed over nights. I didn't have much of a problem with how slow it was. And i didn't have to deal with as many custmers at night."
good,"Work was for the most part as much as you put in you got back.  Co workers are friendly but, management can be tense sometimes. Though if you listen and do the work set out for you to do it is fun."
good,Walmart is always busy business but with a lot of turn around. to Advance to management it was a lot of who you know or how close you become to upper management.
good,"There was very little room to grow into a management role unless you where a favorite of the CSMs. I was interviewed multiple times for Front End CSM and I was passed up each time for an employee that fit in better with their ""clique""."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart because your co worker become like family. It was alot of work sometimes but your peers make it better. The customers too!
good,i like the enviroment and the people are great. onlly thing i had a problem with is i didnt like my department and i talked to like 5 different people and never got transfered but a person that was in my orientation class got transfered to 4 different places just for asking. they arent fair when it comes to placing you in different places like they say
good,"I've worked at Wal-Mart for 9 years. I started out as an overnight door greeter. Then went to cashier,then stocker. I'am flexible and they use me to cashier when it gets super busy up front till the store closes at midnight. Then we throw freight,zone etc. But there's been rumor that the store will be shutting down the overnight staff. That's why I'm kinda looking around at other jobs just in case."
good,"Walmart has good and bad like most places. They always helped associates in need. They collected donations from associates ,when my son passed away. A nother associate had need of a car seat.  Stock purchase was matched by company. I am not able to say what it is like now. As I worked there over 9 years ago."
good,walmart was cool i hated the job but the people i worked with made me want to come to work everyday they really don't pay good the managers will go back and forth with you
good,I would get into work and check the customer orders.  If there was orders I would do them or else I would work on providing product for the store while dealing with customers questions.   Store can be fast pace. The hardest part is when other employees would not finish there task and would leave it for the night crew to finish.  The most enjoyable part is the customers
good,"Assisting customers, being a jewelry associate, selling merchandise to customers. Assisting managers with things they need help with , Having task that I easily achieved"
good,The pharmacy manager doesn’t know how to manage people. The store I worked at is a very busy store doing 600-800 prescriptions Monday-Friday. They will work with you on your schedule. They won’t tell you thank you or let you know that you are appreciated. Only point out flaws. Most of the employees are easy to get along with. And they help you learn the Walmart way of doing things.
good,Not a bad place to work. It can get a little hectic at times but nothing that isn't manageable. The hour lunch is nice. Either way hopefully people can enjoy working there.
good,Days could be long and slow or busy and fast; if you like standing and talking to people this job would work for you. hours vary and flexible. job itself not hard.
good,Fast paced environment that is always changing. They are constantly looking to improve and challenge their associates to be the best they can. Very demanding industry and tough for work/life balance in a management role.
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers find what they were looking for."
good,Ordering supplies and helping people find what they need when looking for eye glasses or contacts. In some cases I would teach people how to put in his/her contact lenses. I would also assist the Dr. with Spanish speaking patients. Call patients to let them know their glasses or contact lenses were ready for pick up. The most difficult part of this job was not being able to help a patient with what they need. I enjoyed my co-workers the most.
good,Everyone was friendly and helped when asked. Managment actually took time to meet and talk with employees. I would recommend working there only bad thing was they pay.
good,Really chill workplace enjoyed the fun coworkers they made the day go by fast and some supervisors were really nice and got along with everyone . It was a fun and entertaining place with different types of customers .
good,Walmart was a good place to learn what I am good at and what meaningful in working for an extended period of time for one company. For people that come out of high school it is a great place to start.
good,Walmart was a very nice and productive work force. Working there helped me to deal with people better and it was great benefits. It’s just the pay was terrible and management was terrible
good,Buen lugar para tabajar siempre tenia algo nuevo que aprender
good,"Es una empresa que te permite crecer, buen ambiente laboral, te ofrece estabilidad!"
good,i really like how fast paced the work is and the time goes by so fast cause you always have something to do. i enjoyed working there cause the people and environment was awesome.
good,"A typical day at work was long, and the same thing every day. I didn't really learn anything working for Walmart. the management was there when needed."
good,"Everyone has a different career life with Walmart, not all are alike. It is what you make of it and success is possible. Growth is quite possible if you work hard, are willing to learn and perhaps even relocate during your career."
good,"I learned my job and I feel I did a great job. My customers loved me and told me that they loved when I was working. I would have liked to have the chance to be a Pharmacy Tech but it was never offered to me. After 3 years I was making $11.20 and hr. "
good,"A fast past demanding company."
good,Current store manager and part of her team are not concerned enough about associates but more about appearance. I have been ill and they are pushing me beyond my limits. Expectation of associate is the work of 3.
good,"I was there for 4 months, just trying to make a living and seeing if another job would pop up. Cashiering wasn't hard, and neither was self check out. It was pretty decent, and there's always that one person that once to ruin it for everyone. The CSM that was there, she was ok, but she was tough and if you did one thing wrong, she was vicious. But overall, pretty simple job and the paycheck was decent too. Just remember wear comfy shoes with insoles in them- it truly helps!"
good,"Walmart as a company is a place I spent significant time and effort working for and would do so again. That said, the quality of the job is highly dependent on the quality of the management and whether they hold store employees to realistic goals and expectations. I started as a cart associate and got all the way up to overnight Support Manager thanks to good supervisors training and mentoring me."
good,Good place to work for the only downfall is they don't accept doctors excuses you get points even if you're in the hospital and that count against you
good,"The team works well together and generally become a family. There are several shifts for you to choose, but the hours are set and not flexible once you've chosen. Some of the managers are too new to the scene and only want to threaten to get work done, but most of them are experienced and good to work under."
good,"I quit before all the new changes, might be a different company than what i was used to. But overall it was a good experience. There were some bad managers and some good ones."
good,"I was a cashier and served many customers, was be courteous, and talk to the customers when they came through line, and also thanked the customers. Lots of fun for me."
good,clock in get on the register for two hours. fifteen min brake stock shelves for two hours hour lunch register for another two hours fifteen min brake stock shelves for another  half hour then depending on what time of day it is gather carts and clean the bathrooms
good,Aprendi manejo de caja muy contenta con lo aprendido
good,The job itself isn't really hard as long as you don slack it but the management however isn't the best. at least at the store that i was working at we wouldn't get enough hours and were always behind because the managers couldn't communicate.
good,A typical work day is very calm. I learned how to read labels & more about certain areas at Walmart. Management is good. The hardest part of the job is when workers that work before me do not finish there work.
good,"worked with me with the days i worked ,the insurence was good love the discounts especially when holidays role around liked the management,all around enjoyed working for them,would go back.."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart because the employees were pleasant, the work load was steady, and the customers were nice. Walmart was a friend;y place to work at."
good,"My most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, It made my day just to be able to make them smile while doing my job. I learned a lot from the customers more than the job itself. It was truly eye-opening."
good,"Fun place to work. The workers are very nice and easy to work with.  Right near McDonalds and has a Subway located right in it, so easy places to go to for lunch."
good,"Gathering carts and keeping parking lot cleared, lots of exercise and get to help customers and talk to them. Most managers don't like to come outside so get left alone to work, as long as you did your job."
good,"I was working cashier, sometimes I would tend to the door or stock the shelves. One of the managers knew that I was too skilled to always be in the front, he would try to get me in the back doing more complex tasks."
good,"Walmart's a place where if you don't know how to resolve things on your own, you will drown in the customers' requests. Management would get so bad at times where as a basic associate, I'd have to manage four departments at the same time. Managing four departments of course is not part of the job description. Regardless  they still expect you to run your department smoothly. Plus any problem you have are your own, its an open door policy with closed ears. Not for the faint of heart is all I'm saying unless your stocking which in that case enjoy being useless to customers and expendable to management."
good,"It was a chill job to work with Wal-Mart. I had cool CSMs, coworkers, I got a discount card. Had to leave due to me relocating. Over all good job to work after High School to save for college."
good,its a good  job you have to work hard you have to dill with people you learn to stock you learn to work as a team to get item on to counter and help people fine items
good,"While I had a problem with the management's lack of integrity at the store location I was employed, overall Wallmart is a fantastic place to work. Full-time job opportunities, health benefits at an affordable price, and great people to work with!!"
good,The cultural differences in the employees makes Walmart a challenging place to work. The opportunities for advancement are very time structured but working to learn within the time frames gives you the opportunity to learn all aspects of each position held before advancing to the next.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers on a daily basis. Seeing familiar faces and ensuring their transactions are accurate and quick enlightens my day and reassure myself why I dedicates my time daily while enjoying it.
good,"I was only at Walmart for 4 months due to college, but if I hadn't moved away again I would have liked to continue working here. I enjoyed my coworkers and for the most part the team (including management) was accepting and understanding of any issues. Customers can be difficult at times but that goes with any customer service job; compared to some the clientele here at Walmart were not too bad."
good,"Management is hit or miss.  Don't make a bad first impression and you'll be fine.  The music is repetitive and horrible.  Produce wasn't a bad area to work in, I actually learned a lot about the food."
good,I really enjoyed the work schedule flexibilty and the pay was fair management was not the best but the head of the company tried to compensate for their lack
good,"I enjoy working as a cashier at Walmart because my fellow employees and supervisor's respect me. I enjoy the pace of the work, the daily interaction with a variety of people, and the benefits of feeling accomplished. I'm able to supplement my family's income, buy gifts for friends, and save for my future."
good,"Walmart is proud of its culture; and rightly should be. They have a culture of family within the work environment. I appreciated the company, the people and the culture."
good,"The hours were mostly fixed regardless of the day of the week, shifts were typically 6 hours during the week and 8 on weekends. I learned how to be more flexible with tasks, proper communication, planning and how to manage my own money. The management was well rounded and understanding of my situation. The culture of the fairly calm and fast-paced, being a cashier I had to be efficient in my job. I enjoyed working for Walmart, but due to family complications without being able to drive at the time, I had to leave."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to go to my department and unload the  cart and stock all electronic items on the shelves, help customers either cash out or help them with anything they want within the department. I learned alot of things but one main thing i learned was working with a big team which helped me alot. The management was amazing very friendly and joyfull. The workplace culture is super friendly and such a good place to feel welcomed. The hardest part of the job was looking for more work for me because i tend to finish my daily objective quick. The best part is seeing customers and talking to them and putting a smile on there face."
good,"I enjoy working here, you have multiple opportunities to advance in this company. I would recommend working here. I have had some issues but not many."
good,The biggest opportunity is finding employees that are willing to come to work and actually put in a full day's work.  Company scheduling makes the situation worse.  The culture is the best part of the job.
good,Walmart is a fast paced company. You always had a time frame to have things done. Management needed some work on having favoritism and on who they allowed to advance in the company.
good,Best job I've had so far. Co-workers were great. Positive atmosphere.   I looked forward to work every day.  Easy to fit in and the Walmart crew was very welcoming
good,"Working in Walmart, you gain business awareness, it improves my selling skills, attention on details and lastly is it develop my social and communication skills talking to the costumer."
good,It is a good company to work for but very scary now because there are so many changes happening that nobody is safe inside the store anymore. Positions keep dropping.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was pleasing the customers and seeing them again.  The hardest part of my job was trying to get the number of work hour assigned due to my leg disability.  I helped to open a new store and learned many  things for the time that I worked there.
good,Walmart provides opportunity to promote from within.  I've seen several associates promote.  The schedule is awesome however the pay could be better considering the amount of work there is to be done.
good,Walmart is a good job especially for young adults looking for a good job in this time and day. For those who arent in The best of shape this job could be a challenge. But it pays and you arent expected to meet production until the 90 day mark from your start date.
good,Good culture. Always changing and evolving.  Balance between work and home life is not always good. Hard to advance past assistant manager position due to the fact that most of the co manager positions have been eliminated.
good,"enjoyed a lot of wonderful co workers and customers I learned a lot about  managing  a group of employees and the way to make sure everyone is happy and enjoys their day at work. Some management was a bit difficult this company has a lot of favorites and it makes it hard sometimes to do your job. the advancement in the company is pretty good, sometimes its just hard to move up because the managers pick who gets the promotions and it isn't always the fair way to pick, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and getting to know the regular customers and employees."
good,good job loved working there just had to relocate. i was an warehouse associate in the backroom nice environment nice managers and decent hours. wish i could have stayed but wasn't able to because of relocation.
good,It's like most jobs focusing on customer service. You either have a good day or bad day which is usually dependent on the customers that day. Probably the worst part of working here is sometimes you have a skeleton crew. That's when customers get angry and you have to deal with something that isn't your fault.
good,"The typical day goes by seemingly fast. I started in cap2 and"
good,"great benefits and good environment to work, people are friendly, better pay than a few years ago, they have a great 401k plan and bonuses, discount card after probation period and many chances for a career advancement"
good,My only problem was with management . Overall pretty good place to work. As long as you stay to your self and mind your own you will be just fine. ?I did'nt agree with some things but it was really my place to .
good,"High octane, fuel driven work."
good,Enjoyed the flexibility of touring a different store everyday.  Engaging with associates and the customers was a great feeling. Loved to see people succeed.  Development of people was a nice accomplishment to see when they were able to run there own store.  I enjoyed working my way up in the company as I started out as a unloader and worked my self up through the ranks to market manager.  I ran stores for 16 years and loved helping customers save money so they could live better. The work place culture was awesome because what you put in is what you received in return which was a great career.
good,"It really was not a bad place to work, you know your job you go in everyday and get it done. I especially love working with the public being friendly with the customers. But if you have bad management it can make for a very unhappy place and that's what happened at my last store. I got tired of seeing everyone being what I call his punching bag. I could not stand it a minute longer, so I had to leave something I loved doing, and my co workers."
good,Walmart was very good to me. They gave me the opportunity to learn in many departments. I had lots of support from management to change directions with in the location.
good,A empresa é compremitada  o que dificulta muito  são gerentes que não tem respeito pelos funcinários nem mesmo pela empresa e se torna um argumento para que a empresa fique com uma média a baixo.
good,"I didn't work there for real long because I got hurt, the experience was great though because I got to work in the photo lab and making special products for customers, and take care of their precious memories. I enjoyed it over all, however I had two different supervisors so one would tell me to do one thing and the other would tell me to do what she said so i was being pulled two different ways. Nothing really bad though.. I loved a challenge here and there."
good,when i come to work at 7am and its only 1 worker with the manager and the next worker come in at 4 so I'm helping and assisting customers all by yourself til 4pm
good,I was a people greeter. I enjoyed going to work everyday. I loved seeing all the regulars come in as well as new customers. The staff was always nice and willing to help me when needed.
good,Store management team was knowledgeable ad wanted to help the associates progress in their skills.  The only problem that would arise is when the market manager would come in and micro0manage the store team creating an excess of stress.
good,It was somewhat stressful and my manager was very helpful and kind to the employees.  It was difficult when customers came to the pharmacy and could not afford to pay for all of their prescriptions and some of the medicines had to be changed.  I enjoyed meeting new people every day and being able to interact with them and get to know them as repeat customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart with one complaint.  They are not flexible in working with employees regarding their work schedules.  In my case, I was always scheduled to work nights and most weekends although I had repeatedly asked to be put on days."
good,I was able to switch my hours from evenings to early morning easily. I chose the days I worked. I could always make up my hours if missed. Co-workers weren't always good workers.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, sin embargo hay detalles con los perfiles del personal que deberían considerar"
good,"My review is heavily biased to the Walmart I worked at, each store has different management and employees will have different opinions regardless. I loved working at walmart. The pay was great, especially for an entry level job in my area. My coworkers were awesome and there were only a couple bad managers out of the 6 or 7 that are front end. I wouldn't have left the job at all if they could have worked with my college schedule."
good,Standard janitorial work kept at a fair pace to finish as fast as possible occasional switched out for stocking due to lack of staff from people calling in sick which was actually a nice job to due until a manager switched with another and the manager switched in started asking for the impossible and the only thing kept me working there was my other coworkers and the other manager that worked that shift on the days the switched in manager didn't.
good,I am still currently employed. They give me great options to further my career. They work with their employees to make sure what they want is being done. Hours are very flexible to point they are open.
good,"You are always on the move which helps the day go by fast. You get a great workout, the job is very physical. You get three to four days off a week depending on your schedule."
good,"In charge of managing lines, counting cashes, interacting with customers, scheduling assignments for the day, and keeping the store clean. The management team are great."
good,"I would operate a register, put away returns and clean. I would also manage returns on the register. I learned how much I enjoy this type of work. management helped to resolve situations that required their help. one can get promoted. everyone is offered the chance to apply for a promotion. the hardest part of my job was when I could not help a customer with a problem they may have encountered. as an associate, I enjoyed most aspects of the job-mostly meeting and interacting with the with new customers and employees.i would like to work for this company again. they were very kind to me during my husbands chemo and death."
good,Some people will like large business atmosphere while others woild prefer a simple family kind of business.  Walmart is going to make you feel small.  There is certainly paid training and tests while on the clock.  A variety of jobs there means there is something for anyone.
good,"I started out at Walmart as a part time cashier and advanced through the ranks to store manager. "
good,"It was a good job until they changed my hours and wanted me to take two lunch breaks so not to get overtime.  Also no benefits, however the people I worked with were nice."
good,I worked the 4am to 1pm shift 5 days a week. We were able to have a 1 hour lunch and 2 15 minute breaks as well. I had to load carts to be stocked on the floor
good,Honestly it’s not that bad of a job just the customers can be a real pain. The pay isn’t bad either! $11.00 when you step in the door. Only down fall is getting a full time position a nd management does play favorites.
good,"Overall, I have seen that WalMart is a good company. While I have not seen a lot of it, only being there for maybe 8 months or so, I was pleased with the personal connections I made with the other associates and a few of the Managers. However, the other associates seemed... Very against helping customers or at the very least were not as knowledgeable as I feel they should have been about their area. It was also hard on me as I am a very sociable person, but everyone else around besides a select few people I knew and a few people I became friends with, the associates didn't really seem to like jumping in to help customers."
good,It is a job that enables to you make good money and the ability to work different schedules based on your needs. The biggest thing to know going in is that it is a physically demanding job with long shifts. The opportunity to move to different areas is available as long as you provide great attendance and hit your production goals.
good,it was a good part time job i enjoyed working there but i take school seriously so i had to leave to focus on school overall it was a good job and great work environment
good,"A typical day at Walmart was pretty fast paced.  Everything had their time mark to make with each cart worked. Walmart does teach you a lot of things that are good for day to day life, like communication skills with all the customers you meet everyday.  My team worked well together, we all could rely on each other to get our project done on time to keep the day moving on time.  The worst park about Walmart I would have to say would be some of their management, they can be very rude in upstate new York but every aspect about working at Walmart I enjoyed.  My favorite part of my day was getting to talk to the customers each and everyday.  You never know who you're going to meet one day to the next."
good,Working for Walmart was a good experience and taught me the value of good customer service. I’m glad I had the opportunity to learn the skills they provided and I hope that it benefits me in the future.
good,"It is little stressful because walmart doesn't have that many employees that they need but still they give 40 hours which most people needs. If someone is looking for a first job, they can give a try to walmart."
good,"This place is fast paced yet productive, overtime is given during peak which maybe 12 hour shifts. lunch is rushed there is a place to store items. This work environment can be a little loud"
good,This is a good company to start with and learn many skills that will help in your career advancement. Has plenty of room for growth. The people are like a second family. Good environment to learn.
good,This is an unnecessary step towards apply for other jobs. Do not wish to write a review about this company. Just wanna look towards the future careers available.
good,"This is a busy store and you are on the go at all times. There is always something to do. The job possibilities are endless, there is a position for almost everyone."
good,Your typical teenage job which gives you financial freedom to be able to buy whatever you want. For the most part it was okay and not bad except during holidays and back to school since customers would buy excessively and since you don't have a bagger you would have to check them out as well as bag everything on your own. Sometimes you get a rude customer which can result in ruining your entire day. Overall not bad but would suggest opening more registers when busy hours or helping bagging when lines start to get long.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was something new to me. In my department it was relaxing and not that very stressful, except on the weekends when we dint have enough of people  to help with the crowd. Other departments have different stories, as i managed to make friends with some people around the store. I Learned that i got luck. Nonetheless you can always rely on Walmart to have hours for you it is always consistent."
good,"working here was fun, but some of the managers made it miserable. they were always short staffed which made it hard on the ones who showed up, but that’s all part of the job."
good,I enjoyed the work not the pay. This is a great starter job everyone should try to get in Walmart . They hire and care about there employers . This is a great job to start with .
good,Good place to work in small town where there isn't really many other places. When I worked there they would work around your schedule but I dont think that is the case anymore.
good,A typical day at work would be crazy but also calm at the same time. Walmart is a place where everyone comes to shop. I learned how to manage time according stock correctly and make sure my area of was clean right.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. I was able to obtain a lot of experience in the retail sector. There were plenty of advancement opportunities for anyone wishing to apply themselves.
good,Very fast paced environment. There are some really good people that work there and they make sure that the managers are are trained to be fair and the best leader possible.
good,"Usually smooth environment can get crowded depending on where you live.The job its self is very straight forward depending on the position you choose,as far as stocking goes it's simple and easy but sometimes it can be fast paced especially on holidays and in big cities. Overall I recommend this as a decent temporary or fulltime job."
good,"Gestión de los proyectos al de día Revisión del equipo a cargo, en su trabajo de metas diarias, enviar reportes diarios a los clientes, reuniones, trabajo en equipo, y la cultura de los resultados al día."
good,Make sure your ready to work and that your have your work uniform on and that your hygiene is good keep a smile on your face at all times. Ask questions make sure your customers leave satisfied
good,"The job isn't bad, comfortable atmosphere with plenty of good workers. The management is good and knows what they are doing but have poor communication which can result in situations that make both parties angry. The atmosphere of my position was light and fun as we got our work done. The hardest part of the job was handling the customers that wanted the impossible. The best part would be when everything goes smoothly unloading a packed truck."
good,Got this job young it was pretty easy. It’s really easy money being a cashier. I would recommmend to high schoolers. They hire 17 year olds. They give 18 & older more hours.
good,"I have worked at Walmart for about 4 years now, since my senior year in high school. the reason I am choosing to leave this job is for career advancement."
good,my typical day started at 7am with stocking shelves and making frequent trips to the the warehouse. I may end up spending my entire shift at the customer service desk dealing with customers who are returning stuff they had bought earlier.
good,"Walmart is an amazing job to have: we’ll pay, good benefits, good environment, and you get to experience what it’s like working for a big corporation."
good,But the management wont hitting on nothing they aint know what they was doing half the time but it was a great job to have much to do at Wal-Mart they have doing alot if they like you and know u gone work hard.
good,"If you work for them plan on seeing them more that your family.  The joke was every manager was on the ""B"" schedule, just be there.  There was no work life balance."
good,"Empresa que apoya al primer empleo, es de fácil acceso."
good,"A typical workday, it starts off peaceful depending on the times that you work, it's not a bad place to work. Management can be a lot better than it is now, if they learned how to work together instead of against each other. Also the way they speak to they're employees, I believe Walmart can be a better place to work at. Workplace culture everything in that category is perfectly fine. It's nothing really hard, except for the freight."
good,"During my time at Walmart I was a courtesy associate and a cashier. My second manager didnt seem to care about the well being of the cart pushers and people out side at all. Other than the manager I had at the time my coworkers were wonderful, the CSMs were some of the nicest and inspirational people I can say I worked with."
good,Over all being there for 4 yrs really change my life I met a lot genuine people that help me w the job and being a better person. I love working there and miss seeing my favorite customers.
good,"In my opinion, it takes time getting used to working at walmart.  For my position it was hard I di stock and I had to quickly figure out where things belonged because they moved me all over the store."
good,walmart is a great job to actually work it is one of the highiest paid retail stores although the job was fun the managment was very poor i was forced to quit due to certain managers abuse of power the most enjoyable part of the job was working and interacting with the customers you get so caught up in time you forget how much time goes past and before you know it ... its time for you to clock out
good,"El ambiente de trabajo dentro de la empresa, puede ser pesado, pero por la carga de trabajo, solo es cuestión de organizarse y adaptarnos rápidamente a lo que el CeDis (en este casó) necesitaba y formar u equipo de trabajo solido de tal manera que no se sienta tan pesado el trabajo y sea un lugar de trabajo agradable."
good,"I started as a cashier on the front end working part-time. I moved to the deli after 6 months starting as a cashier and went to full-time with flexible hours.  After working in the deli for a 1 1/2 years, I went back to the front end to work as a Customer Service Manager.  My experience at Walmart was productive."
good,Very supportive company with a culture that's always trying to reward and help others exceed. Would certainly recommend for anyone looking for a long and satisfying career in retail.
good,I love working at Walmart. I do wish that I had more opportunity to learn and Advance. I'm a customer service manager and therefore do not get a lot of experience on the floor which is necessary for advancement
good,"I loved Walmart my experience was excellent  "
good,Walmart is a good place to work you are busy all day. There is some good stores and some bad stores.  There is always something to do it's retail so you work on holidays and weekends.
good,I really love the people i work with and im lucky to have a wonderful manager! The only part that's hard us I've never gotten much training in the different positions I've had. I've always had to figure it out myself.
good,"It can be hectic at times. Management can be under lots of stress. If you are willing to put in the work, the job can be manageable and safe. A lot of it comes down to perspective. If you are getting tired of tediousness about it, you probably don't want to work here. But if you can think positively or say that it isn't as bad as x, y and z other things you could be doing, then you'd probably be fine working here."
good,"Decent workdays, some are busier than others. Management was okay. Easy to make friends. Balancing various tasks with customer service and managing to get work done in time was probably the most annoying part, but you get used to it."
good,As a first job to dtart at 11 an hour is excellent. There were some problems like at times brakes were given way to late and having to stay a lot later than the time given to leave due to no one being there to take over.
good,The neighborhood Walmart is a great company  to work for. There are always the pros and cons with any place of employment.  The customers well some of the customers can be mean sometimes but you  just have to remember your role with the customers meaning you are there to take care of their needs and. Giving the the best customer service . Because I always have to think  this customer is the reason. I’m here and getting paid to take care of there needs
good,"This Walmart was always busy and I had to learn how to communicate with a lot of customers, although the customers can get a little argue about things that’s not really store policy . I had to remain calm to help the customer as possible if things didn’t get solved in the that matter of time I will have to call a manager or a supervisor.  Things I did around store was to stock my items in the correct order and I was a cart man . Collecting cart returning them , cleaning parking lot and helping customers wit carry outs."
good,"A typical day at work is just as expected of any retail pharmacy, helping customers with their prescription or over the counter medications. It is a place to develop good communication skill since pharmacy is a place where people stop by from different walks of life."
good,"Good place to work got me by"
good,It was really good experience for me. To deal with more difficult customers. The co workers were very helpful and understanding everytime. Would recommend to apply.
good,It was okay for someone who is going to school hours are flexible and they will give you the days that you want off so you can go to school part-time was the schedule I had and it was good for me because at the time I was going to school.
good,"This was a great job at first and I enjoyed the people I worked with. My CSM's were always kind but, got business done which I admired. I would have stayed longer but, my hours started getting cut so soon it wasn't worth the gas it took to get me to work."
good,"It is a good place to work. I would do it again if I had to . Pay needs to increase and more time off on the weekends, adding some benefits to the part time employees."
good,"When working for this company, I found that the work environment was organized and easy to map out. "
good,"A typical day at Walmart was doing your assigned tasks or job and always helping customers when needed. We also would jump from place to place and help others who were short staffed or overwhelmed. Overall management wasn't too bad, but lack of consistency and follow up was an issue. Hard working employees would get frustrated with the lack of management following thru with the problem employees, instead they would have the dedicated or harder working employees pick up the slack."
good,I enjoyed working for the company. The overnight shift was fast moving. It was usually the same thing nightly depending on the area that you were assigned to that particular night.
good,"my days were mostly upbeat and busy. There I learned the check cashing routine and procedures. management was okay they would stand by us if we asked for help. the hardest  part of the job was the fast pace at check cashing on Fridays, but there than that it was nice to know you were a help to people."
good,"Normally on a typical day of work its pretty fast paced but you tend to get in the zone when you and your other associates are working their hardest and you normally end up getting everything done a bit early witch is always nice, you can spend more time doing extra stuff. I have learned that when being rushed, all that you have to do is stay calm and try your best to do your job quick and make sure you do it correctly. While working at Walmart I learned that management can be very useful when dealing with upset customers and can be helpful when things are speeding up pretty quickly. I would say the hardest part of the job is training new people, it can take a bit for new people to learn all the tasks in their shift. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my coworkers, I make friends pretty easily and i enjoyed working with them so much."
good,I was knowledgeable and very willing to learn new processes to make sure I made goals established by upper management and also keep enough staff to handle the daily work schedule.
good,A good work place where you see a lot of different faces and meet a lot of people. You learn how to work in different areas of the store. As long as you are doing your job and task there will be no problems.
good,its a good job dis if u comeing out high school it a good job so i never had no bad time at wal mart so with dat been sed im am happy to so i wuz happy to be dair
good,"As an associate your day can be filled with energetic flexibility yet challenging to your day. The atmosphere is very much what one makes it, if you want your day to be fun it's up to the attitude you come to work with. Many of the customer are very friendly especially if they know you have done all you could do to make their visit to your store the best one possible.  Walmart allows you to take ownership for the department in you work and make it all that it can be. The reason is what you do reflects who you are as a person and an associate.  As an associate we have the ability to own stack in the company which is part of the reason that you take pride in what you do at Walmart.  And provide the best customer service you can because this is what makes your customers return and what ensures you have a job that you feel proud of."
good,"I lucked out with having an incredible department manager. He was excellent at training us and he was just a great person to be around.I had some issues with a few managers outside of my department but it was mainly minor issues. The pay was excellent and I got along with my coworkers for the most part. They are kind of picky about giving people full time but once you prove yourself, they will at least give you full time hours. I was in the garage so I had to deal with all weather conditions, which I personally don't mind. There is a lot of walking involved and the occasional nasty customer."
good,"8-10 hour shift"
good,Walmart was a great job with many benefits. It's a fast- paced job that requires a lot of standing in one spot as a cashier.  I enjoyed interacting with customers and providing them with a excellent shopping experience.
good,It was a fast paste job ge time went by fast. The people I worked with where nice. I left sooner then I thought because I had to relocate due to a family emergency.
good,"Overall, Walmart is a good place to work. Co-workers and management are cooperative and helpful. Pay is fair and benefits are available. The point system for absences is not a fair way to determine absences due to illness."
good,Walmart as a career is a good leap into the realities of retail and has helped me learn to be better prepared in times of pressure. It is a good starting job to take steps on climbing the ladder.
good,I started working day shift . Customer Service. Cashier. Money Center. Was offered a position working 3rd shift in shipping. Management. More money. Enjoyed working this shift at the time. Would not work for me now.. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Its its a nice place 2 work .Your able 2 enhance u life jobs and career right there all in walmart.. I'm able 2 meet & greet new faces everyday from associate to customers and it help me with awareness of different cultures
good,They expect 12 dollars of work for 10 dollars of pay and don't take suggestions well. It was hard work you are on your feet all day long but the coworkers are nice. Other than those that think they are better than anyone else
good,nice job and it absolutely kept me busy which helped for a fast shift. I like a job to keep me with a task to do. the managers were awesome and very easy t talk to if something was not right
good,Pretty good Just gotta Be Careful .. But the job is great please good people great environment but it wasn’t for me I just need more space & See More & Just adventure out
good,"It is pretty good.  It is a tough job but if you stick at it you can find it very enjoyable.  It is retail so it is holidays, weekends, and inconvenient shifts."
good,"Buena empresa para iniciar en el campo laboral, ya que te permite aprender en diferentes áreas. Se le da seguimiento a la capacitación, sin embargo, se cuenta con muy poco material"
good,There is room and opportunity for advancement. There are also good benefits available. Easy to move up in the company. Didn't take me long to move up.
good,"-A typical day at work varied. If it was slow, there wasn't much to do, but if it was busy, you didn't have time to check the clock."
good,a typical day started with setting up the back warehouse in the store so we could easily separate the products that were being taken off the truck. after everything is off the truck we get another one with more food items on it then we take those pallets to the specific area to be broken down stocked and shelved.
good,Customers were friendly more than not. You would develop relationships with those that came in on a regular basis. Managers were quick to help when you needed help. Had our backs when we were following policy and customers wanted to complain. Management also gave you chances in other departments or areas to help you find your best fit.
good,I feel as though it’s a good job could be better good people good stuff good a lot of good I can say the good outweighs the bad  so I will refer a lot of people
good,"Honestly, Walmart is not a bad place to start at. The entry pay is $10 and it’s very easy going(and relaxed) it’s not very stressful. Managers are almost always glad to help you out, and answer any questions you may have."
good,"A empressa boa pra trabalho, único poblema que não tinha benefício, como vale alimentação, ajulda de custo, aí viajava em toda região de Umuarama aí ficava meio complicado eu ficar na empressa"
good,Come in stock shelves help customers pretty basic. They pay 11hr so that is not bad for a teenager but for someone who is trying to support a family it can be difficult
good,co workers were really easy to get along with. Managers understood stuff happens so they would cut you clack or work around your schedule. the only down sides are sometimes the managers are too relaxed and nothing gets done. Then the other downside is you don't get paid any extra for working holidays so it makes it hard to go in those days. Over all its a fun place you just have to be able to handle doing some stuff yourself that's not in your job description.
good,My old job at farmerville walmart was hard and confusing at first  but fun . Only wish they had better communication and better management that willing to help with difficult problems.
good,Over all Walmart is a great place to work and start a career out for someone that like it. I really enjoyed being there and enjoyed most of the associates.
good,I enjoyed working as a cashier. At some moments it was difficult because we were selling bags and would get a lot of complaints on that. I always listened to customers and helped them and got a lot of appreciation on how i connected with people and bagging really well and putting things in their cart.
good,"Walmart have a bonus every 3 months for profit."
good,You’re required to lift and accurately stack sometimes very heavy product in a timely manner. Warehouse style work with decent pay for the required tasks
good,"Walmart is good and bad at the same time. Just like any other place of employment the rules are set. Sometimes things are unfair but its work."
good,Walmart is a very busy company. The line are always filled customers service are very good. It’s taught me a few new things. It taught me about the WIC which had no idea what it was.
good,"Sometimes you get a really good set of managers, and other times you get bad ones. They're good to work for, great benefits, good pay, it's just sometimes the managers don't care."
good,"On a given day at Walmart, it can either be the easiest day of your shift or the most busiest day of your life. Management could be better but that's any job. Depending on your location, job advancement may not be easy to come-by. Overall, I enjoyed my time working for Walmart and would recommend them to anyone in need of a job."
good,the work place at walmart was very stressful enviorment. also the travel time was very far for me. i work a lot of over time. to compensate for what i didn't make on my regular pay
good,A typical day at work starts with opening the wireless department and helping customers that come in with cell phone issues. I also do inventory everyday for the post pay and pre paid phones that we sell. I have learned how to set up post and pre paid phones and also how to run credit checks for my department. The hardest part of my job is not have merchandise on hand when customers come in to make a purchase because we are out of stock or the merchandise didn't come in. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to help my customers and make sure they have everything that they need before leaving my department.
good,Customer focused good work environment. Very stressful at times but also very fulfilling. If you are willing to work hard and stand tall you will promoted and be seen.
good,The pharmacy was very fast paced. This is the kind of work I enjoy. Everyone was very helpful and willing to teach. I got laid off because the company decided to cut back.
good,"While stressful at times when under certain managers, the work space is enjoyable, the people are enjoyable to work alongside in most cases. It pains me that my move was sudden that I had to miss out on continued employment there."
good,Good place to work but no quality of life for manager.  Very willing to work around the lives of the hourly associates but not for managers.  This is a business after all.
good,"I enjoyed being free and trusted to get my tasks done, I enjoyed the responsibility aspect of the job. It was like I was to report to my boss and then carry on my day fulfilling my tasks, then report back to management when completed."
good,"empresa muy dinamica,clientela selecta,revision de procesos y calidad al 100%"
good,"I enjoyed my job there great coworkers and management , room for advancement , dress code changed, the staff was very helpful, made learning fun, worked with you on schedule accommodation."
good,"it was a good job and very relaxing. There were a lot of good workers there, and tea work was great! I think that they should work more with people trying to better themselves."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. It is a very fast paced business and you do need to be able to multitask.  There is not a lot of time for fun time on the job. The environment can get difficult at times "
good,"I learn at Walmart ,how to contact with customer.How to communicate with co-worker.How to help customer .Help co-worker in busy situation.Maintain the quality of work."
good,"It was a fun place to work! I actually loved it there, the other people in my department were fun to work with and you easily made friends! The management although gave you a rough time about everything and didn’t exactly stick to your scheduled breaks."
good,"Management at the time. Great. Responded, supported and helped us to grow. Lot's of opportunity. Only left because I moved. It would have been a almost hour drive one way."
good,"Walmart had a great computer system, which made it very"
good,"At the time of my hire, the management was always there to help me Improve my work style. Everyone was friendly to each other. Retail jobs are not made for me."
good,You get out of it whay you put in it. It takes a great management team to make a.atore work. When the management team is questionable it makes employment hard.
good,Great employer with diverse leadership. If you find a great mentor you can be successful and have an outstanding career. The associates are key to the success of this company.
good,There are things that are great about working there and others that are absolutely miserable. I guess it is that way with a lot of workplaces but it seems like the management just doesn't care enough to fix situations.
good,My experience at Walmart was alright at best. You never run out of things to do. The people you get to help are often pretty interesting. I wouldn't want to make a career out of it.
good,Wal-Mart Canada is very open to opportunities for the right group of people. Those who can respect the team structure of a work place above their individual wants will do well.
good,"I had a great team and Manager's to work with. I stayed busy by choice so I was able to do other things than what I was hired for. I enjoyed it, So I was one of the lucky ones."
good,"Overall it is a decent place to work. It is a very nice place the work for the people because you know who they are when they return. It is a family environment.,"
good,Good on job training can be so helpful and getting cross trained to inhance skills room for advancement is available always lots of management changed hands but open door policy can resolve problems when needed good starter job to get lots of exciting things to learn safe place to work
good,Walmart is a great place to work and make a living. This company offers a lot of benefits for their employees. It is a good work atmosphere and customer friendly.
good,"Largest employer in the world...they do their best. Retail sucks pretty much regardless of which employer. Walmart gets a lot of bad press, but most stores and managers try to treat their employees well."
good,Enjoy working for Walmart. Benefits are good and hourly wage is good for the area.  Some minor issues as with all large retail stores. Would recommend to others.
good,I was appreciated and received a promotion before the end of my probationary period. A lot of good people who are like family.  I like working for Walmart.
good,Since I've worked at Walmart I learned how to interact better with the customers and my coworkers.  I have progressed and know how to solve problems in a timely manner.
good,typically have to start by unloading truck which is very fast paced. once that is done have to run product to the floor and help customer as wee stock shelves
good,"If the pay was better I would have stayed,it was a decent company but I had an opportunity to do better for myself and my newly expanding family. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to afford diapers on Walmart wages. So I gave 8 weeks notice to get them through Christmas and left for bigger and better."
good,I love the employees there. Just ready to do something new.. I have 3 boys and a single mom and wanting something better and to show me what I want to approve of my goals
good,"Hours are not as good , the workplace is slightly unorganized , management and all associates are friendly and easy to work with. I learned stocking process and how to build party trays."
good,I loved working there every day I learn something new. I really like helping out the customers when they have a problem. Also they give you your 40hrs that’s a great pay check.
good,"For the most part we had a good management team.  My immediate supervisors were always helpful and encouraging me to advance.  I started out a cashier, not wanting more but, with the persistance of my supervisors I quickly moved through the departments and became a CSM.  I eventually applied for a position in the pharmacy, and with no experience I was hired and trained as a technician.  Sometimes the customers could be unbearable, but others they were the best part of the job."
good,"Gained Canadian Experience."
good,I loved working there but the management was very rude to employees and customers and didn't really care about anything or anybody but themselves. You do get a lot of hours and get paid well for your job
good,".very stressful job. Handled all the night people and customers. Was very fair and honest. Brought out all the freight at night. And walked with all the mangers every morning, I could handle the mangers when they where in a moode with a smile."
good,Definitely the highest paying job to start off with. Managers were alright. Co-workers were some of the best I had and made working less boring all the time.
good,Walmart is a general large company. Its a fairly nice job environment. The unfortunate part is that as a large company that can easily hire anyone that one the regular team members and associates are easy to replace.
good,"Working for Walmart can be hectic at times,it's a very fast paced environment but overall a great company. They start you off at a decent pay rate, bonus every 3 months if you qualify,discounts,benefits and PTO."
good,Es un trabajo muy bueno y tranquilo con muchas facilidades con respecto al campo de trabajo
good,I really enjoy my job at Walmart. I love stocking and working in the bins. I also really appreciate the associates on my team and our supervisor. Walmart makes sure to hire team players for everyone’s benefit.
good,A typical day working asset protection would include having to apprehend suspects if you see them trying to leave the store with merchandise and doing reports on said incidents before leaving merchandise with Walmart employee to restock
good,Overall its a decent place to work if you availability is unlimited. Hours get cut if your unable to work certain times....which they make you aware of. Managers overall are decent you get managers ever so often that dont want to work with you and are stubborn. Overall i would recommend it for a good start out job.
good,"In a typical day you are talking to a bunch of customers and assisting them in their needs around the store. Working well along side your co-workers is very important in being efficient and accomplishing many tasks. As a cashier, you learn quick and work quick; alway on your feet. They gave us adequate breaks and a nice work lounge to sit and catch your breath. Working in Layaway, we were constantly moving. The atmosphere in the work place is overall positive."
good,Wal-Mart was a very unstable place where there was little communication. Management was the last to help in any situation or work experience. One of worst places to work.
good,"Walmart is friendly and cares about their employees. Its easy to grow and advance with the company, and the financial perks are very benificial. There's never a dull moment during the holiday season."
good,"Em geral e uma empresa boa, mas tem muito que melhorar."
good,Manager made it difficult to enjoy working there. Too much favoritism. Glad to hear manager is not there anymore. Wouldn't work there in that department again.
good,Unrealistic standards set for hourly associates that require management to finish their jobs taking away from actual managerial duties.  Poor work life balance for salary management often times having to skip lunches and stay late in order to ensure task are finished.  Fast paced company that changes daily and provides stimulating challenges.
good,"Training Coordinator there's a lot to do from conducting orientations to making sure the new associates start and finish all of there computer training."
good,Is coming in with a good aditude and be pump and motivated be for you come in to get ready for the night. The hardest part of the job was to stay focused on your work at all times.
good,"I enjoy working at Wal-Mart.  My duties were bag prescriptions, waiting on customers, returns, and mailing out prescriptions. The hardest part was not being to help the Tech work."
good,"I work as a customer host, and it was a good job. I greeted customer coming and leaving from the store. I also checked receipt to make sure they was trying to take an item not paid for."
good,itsproductive but employees are constantly slacking in their work. managment plays favorites. makes every one elses job harder then it has to be. employees offten hide to avoid work or managers.
good,"It is what you would expect, though definitely depends on your location and management if you are going to have a pleasant experience working there. The pay is worth it if you are working retail though."
good,My experience at Walmart was really good the management there was helpful and understanding with students and lifestyle such as sports played through school and also the culture there was very friendly and welcoming with new employees
good,The e-commerce management are great. They get in and work just as hard as we do. The customers are great and they try to tip us but we are not allowed to take tips.
good,Walmart is a decent place to work. Some days are busier than others but it just depends on time of year/month. For the most part everyone who works inside of Walmart are decent people.
good,"I loved working there for my first job, now I definitely see how it could have been a better experience. I never had a day Off even when I requested it , there would always be a reason I coulnd thave it off & they also dont rotate shifts with everyone so who ever already has the good shifts will always have them ! so in other words you work all the badshifts."
good,Great teamwork good hours and definitely friendly and great employees to work with hours are very flexible definitely and very diverse workplace loved
good,I think walmart is a great place to work i enjoy the environment and fast pace the workers are like a family and the pay and hrs are pretty cool and its a very convenient place to shop
good,A typical day at work was fast paced and active. I learned time management working this job. The job culture is customer service based and reflected individual accountability for the most part. The hardest part of this job was organizing with co-workers to find solutions for customers.
good,Walmart is a good company with opportunity for advancement if you apply yourself and learn everything you can.  I had to move or I would still be employed with Wal-Mart
good,"There are good managers, there are less good managers, there are days where you want to pull your hair out from all the deadlines and stress, there are days where things are pretty lax because half your shift didn't call in. The pay is good for retail and nothing is to backbreaking for the average worker to handle, the biggest thing with this job is whether you are competent at dealing with customers, and can deal with the stress of it."
good,A typical day work includes making appropriate decisions about how to manage the daily workload while also planning based on the weekly forecast.  I have learned to manage a wide variety of people which represent unique opportunities.  The hardest part about the job is adapting to constant change as we look to continuously improve our processes by trial and error initiatives.  The best part of the job is working with a variety of people who make for a challenging and also make for great learning experience for an area manager.
good,Working at walmart was an interesting experience. depending on which store you work in and how the store manager manages his store you may have a good experience or a bad one.
good,The start pay is great for a young adult. They do not work with your schedule. So be very clear about your availability. You are standing for 8 hour. So have Comfortable shoes
good,Un lugar en el que puedes trabajar si quieres aprender cosas nuevas
good,Prepares you for anything and everything out there as far as jobs. If you can be in management for Walmart you can manage just about anything. Has shown helped me grow as an adult and become the best i can be.
good,I loved working with all the employees there some were back bitting employees doinganything to get a better job or a job they didnt have to work so hard for but most of the employees were hard workers.
good,"Great company with flexible hours. I have worked for Walmart for 12 yeats, some were fun and others were not that great. I would recommend this place as a great 1st job."
good,"My experience at walmart has been wave-like. Sometimes it had really charming moments, and others downright disgusting. That is just the notion of carrying a job to me. Those kinds of things are to be expected and honored. Walmart as a whole is a rather decent and fair company, but yes improvement can be used in certain elements such as teaching."
good,It was an okay job. We were always getting new management though so that was annoying. the job was pretty stressful and they expected us to work very fast.  I really enjoyed working with my team members and I felt like they knew how to make the time go by faster. The typical day at work consists of unloading trucks. we did it very fast that was my least favorite thing to do. After unloading the trucks everybody went to go stock shelves. If you get the right person to help you stoking can be fun. I liked the few times I got to interact with customers. My favorite part was helping people find the things they needed.
good,Wal-Mart is a good job for a first or later job. There are lots of people to get to know. There is always something to do so you can keep busy. You can relocate to a different position of you don't like the one you initially picked out. The management is helpful. The uniform policy is a bit prude. Their attendance policy is pretty bad. They don't give you much room for being ill.
good,"Because of Walmart, I was introduced to a new career field. I found a job as a pharmacy technician after I got certified. The thing I like the least about Walmart pharmacy work is the uniform. The blue jackets are not attractive and somewhat scratchy."
good,Love cake decorating and taking care of our members great associates feels like a family it’s a great place to work with great benefits room for advancement
good,"A typical day at work for me is working hard and making sure everything at Walmart was perfect. I worked all over Walmart. In the toys section, electronics, food, and cashier. The experiences I learned there were great and it taught me so much. The management there was good but I think it can be better. the workplaces culture was good because they have people working in different areas at the same time and not have one person doing everything. The hardest part of working at Walmart were the rules. They were so strict. Finally but not least the best part about working there were my coworkers. They always helped me if or when i needed it and they were understanding."
good,"Walmart over all was a very good workplace, I enjoyed the work and the pay; Also I enjoyed putting a smile on everyone’s face. The job was mostly laid back and you have your own freedom as well."
good,"Im curious to know how much do cap 2 employees make monthly full time / part time.? Also I want to know how fast can I get promoted from cap 2 to a training coordinator position.?"
good,"Overall a great job, not always the best when it comes to advancing within the company and sometimes shifts would be switched without my knowledge. I could check my schedule at any time with the app, though and everyone was always friendly. I kinda miss it sometimes!"
good,"Se trabaja con buen ambiente, pero hay mucha confusión con las politicas de la empresa"
good,"They worked with my hours, I was pregnant and had to be home for my fiancé to be able to leave for work bc I couldn't afford daycare for my oldest daughter."
good,"I learned how to manage my schedule for the day and plan out what needed to be done, when and how it was going to get done. There is a ton of ways to move up in the company and management for the most part is very easy to get along with as long as your doing your job."
good,"A typical day at work is usually the same routine."
good,I liked working there. I liked my customers most of them knew me wasn’t hard to get alone with others . I loved the work environment. Sometimes they wanted too much out of one person and there wasn’t enough hours for the person to get the job done but other than that it’s a good job.
good,"es buen lugar, el pago es a tiempo. hay muchos beneficios de empresa."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart while I did, the company as a whole is well put together and the management is good. Alot of work required you to work with other employees. Most of the job was customer service and restocking shelves"
good,"The management is the low point of this job, The Job is very easy to start, however employees can be treated unfairly, and hours are spiratic. Benefits are good."
good,Walmart Is A Nice Place To Work In It’s Just The People You a Work With And Some Times Rude Customers I’ll Recommend Money Center As One Of The Best Work Places
good,I really enjoyed working at walmart the security is just bad becasue they dont take your situation serious but i was a team player and also a team leader one thing i can say i will b missed from walmart but security wasnt good
good,Its a job if you are willing to work hard and accept the ups and downs of a work environment you will be fine as long as you behave as an adult. The hardest part of the job will be to deal with the many customer and employee personalities and overall work habits.
good,For the most part its a good work environment.  The only thing is certain mangers would give certain people more work than others. Which isn't fair work should be divided equally.
good,"I would clock in, clean my work area, Zone the shelves. Get the product to stock,and then any overstock went to the back.I would also help customers as needed."
good,Walmart is a very fasted passed job and very busy at time. has many possibilities to move up into management and other departments. you get to meet a lot of different people.
good,At the time I was employed I was a cashier sometimes door greeter. Gained great customer service skills. Learned how to count back cash. Enjoyed the environment.
good,"I liked working at Walmart because it was fast pace and always something to do. The employees always stayed busy and no one was standing around because there was always something to be done. Also, I like working with people because I am a people person."
good,It’s not the best job based on the pay but sometimes it’s a very relaxed environment. There is not much bother from supervisors as long as you are doing your job.I learned how to stock take care of the department cap the best supervisor treated me good and trained me good it was relaxing and hard work paid off best benefits
good,A good company to work for. You can go any where if willing to move around the world! Willing to promote within the company if you are a hard dedicated worker.
good,"Worked 50 hours per week, set hours per week.  Managed GM side of super center.  Work was fast paced but manageable.  High employee turnover in my store."
good,"cet emploie a été une bonne experience en matière de management, gestion de stress, et prise de decision."
good,"Walmart has treated me pretty well over the past few years. Job security, flexible hours, they work with your availability, the pay is pretty outstanding for retail. Highly recommend Walmart."
good,"Not every one at WalMart is treated with utmost respect no matter what the literature says most of the time it depends on the department you work in, I had to take a leave of absence to recuperate from illness at this time I am still attached to Wal-Mart but I cannot return to work because my Physician put it in writing of Disability and I need a RTW physical which they want me to pay out of pocket and am unable to do this at this time."
good,"Work 10hr days, work reports for 2 different departments, have to catch up from the days before every Monday. Management are hardly ever trained in the department they work in. No managers know what I do and what it takes to get it done accurately."
good,It was a great place to work. Stayed busy but wasn't to bad unless we were short handed. Great thing about it was you worked around others and developed friendships.
good,"Pretty laid back job depending on the position, works well with college student schedules. Easy to change and switch shifts. Pay is decent compared to other retail stores."
good,Mangment was nice to work with and very understanding in short notice. Worked with me and my family in some very hard times. The company loved giving back there their people.
good,"Associates & most customers are fun to work with. "
good,j'aimais sa et ces bien chez walmart mais ce n'étais pas pour moi.
good,"Fast-paced environment with minimal supervision once job competencies have been learned.  High focus on customer service, stocking merchandise, and departmental cleanliness."
good,Management I worked withwas usually pretty fair although they wanted a lot out of their stockers and I felt that I could find a easier job with better pay else where
good,Manager's kept you on track. Was easy to know what your job is. Nighttime was hard to get through and people had left over work they didn't complete. Employees were unethical.
good,"1]A place with a very positive work culture."
good,"Well let's see I clock in and I go and grab a top stock cart from the back along with a gemini and printer. I grab a few break-pack boxes for my returns so they don't end up all over the floor. I go to check my return for my departments and I put them away. All while zoning, taking care of the customers, doing top stock and running up to the register when they call for it. It can be pretty hectic especially if it's a weekend or a holiday is coming up. It depends on the day of the week whether or not the store will be busy and what kind of coverage we will have. My coworkers make my day so much more enjoyable. I've been with the company 10 years and yeah I've had my ups and downs but for the most part, it's truly not a bad place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart as a cashier. I was able to interact with many people of different cultures. I LOVED my co-workers there and all of the positive energy that came from them.
good,"This job was fast paced and constant, Keeping customers and associates happy. It was severely understaffed which meant customer service managers were over worked."
good,"I met a lot of good people at Walmart and I enjoyed working for the company, even though the hours decreased at the end of my time their it was still one of my favorite jobs."
good,Good job good people there. They pay good and have good benefits some departments are not easy to run everyday. Get good break times and a place you can make friends with out there.
good,coming to work was straight forward. You sign in have morning meetings and get our merchandise to restock our inventory . Help customers that is not sure of what is needed to where the items are being located in the store. Manage our lunches and break.. Assist customers in cashing out
good,The Walmart team is rapidly innovating to evolve and define the future state of shopping. it is our mission to help people save money and live better.
good,It was a good place to work although it was temporary for me. It was pretty simple work and easy to understand although it was labor extensive. I would recommend to a friend.
good,"Stocking at Wal-Mart consists of pulling unboxed products from the backroom to the shopping floor, stocking them in a timely manner, rotating oldest stock to the front, newest stock in back, and 'facing' or organizing the area you are responsible for. Staff are friendly, and easy to work with. Management allows liberties to do your own work at your own pace, so long as it is done within the allocated time of your shift. Communication is strong between team members, and help is always available if needed."
good,I really miss my friends and coworkers there. Management doesn't seem to get things in order. I like to call it controlled chaos. The pay was decent and the hours were great.
good,This is a very fast paste workplace you have to be on your feet at all times be prepared to clean up some spills you have to be a positive and have a positive mind set in this job field.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, I love make others smile and walmart was the job for me. You meet new people and the work is laid back and break lengths are incredible"
good,Great hours and pay with benefits. Job is only stressful because you get a write up for a lot of stuff. Production was raised to 100% so if it's a 99.97% you will get wrote up! But great coworkers to work around!
good,I love working with customer and having the interaction like working with the people it is a flexible place to work. they work with you with whatever you need
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. They have ample opportunity to move up in the company. The pay is good and they have plenty of opportunities to help in almost any situation.
good,"I enjoy working with most of my co-workers. Some of the CSM's are cranky, but I guess you have to be to deal with some of the complaints. Our current manager, over spent our profit, so we didn't get a bonus in December 2017, so hopefully that doesn't happen anymore."
good,"Working at Walmart truly is a blast, you get your work done but you also get to connect with the people you're working with really well, making you never want to leave."
good,"Deli requires you to work very quickly and communicate as a team. I felt that the employees worked very hard but the managers weren't very nice and they had favorites for sure. The pay is not equal someone could be doing the same job as you, hired at the same time and get paid more. The only good thing about walmart is that you do get your hours."
good,Not too fast paced but could get busy on weekends or holidays. Not too much work on your hands and very flexible scheduling but quite inconsistent with the days you dont have to work.
good,"I have great experiences working for walmart financial shares services ap dept, great place to work but they do not offer part time employment.  Always change going on and layoffs. But the work environment  was great"
good,The pay for the area is competitive. Always knew what I was doing for the day. Fast paced and extremely active which speeds the work hour grind. Company policy is very PC. Some places in the warehouse are hard to make rate and seem unfair but if you can keep a good pace you can do well.
good,"If you are looking for a good start up career, Wal-Mart is the place for you. Not only will you find yourself being challenged beyond your limits, but the skills you'll obtain while working at Wal-Mart will be necessary for any, if not every, job you'll have from that day forward. People skills are a must, and positive attitudes are essential. There is no such things as behind the scenes at Wal-Mart. Customer Interaction is a MUST!!!"
good,"I worked on cash most of the time, but they regularly reposition you so you can be more efficient.  It was easy and simple most of the time.  The hardest part is dealing with customers who are not always satisfied with what you have to offer.  Good environment employee wise though.  It seems really complex at first, and expect to make some mistakes, which many customers will not be happy with, but after 1 or 2 months, I got the hand of being cashier and was able to perform other tasks on the side as well.  Fantastic if you never had a job before."
good,Great place to work. Was a family friendly store. Learned alot of retail from Walmart and met a lot of people I called family. I would go back if I had to.
good,Every day is a different day. You never walk in doing the same thing you learn something new on a daily basis. Walmarr is always looking to bring someone up in the company there goal for each store is 2 per quarter which is an amazing opportunity.
good,Was not impressed with management. Very hard to get hired on full time. Temps not treated well. No thank you for extra work done. Hours not consistent. Can be working all shifts in same week
good,I Loves The Pay But Work Was A Little Hard But I Made It I Think It Was Hard Vecauee It Was My First Job That I Ever Had With A WareHouse But I Would Love To Be Back In A Warehouse.
good,The staff are wonderful to work with. There is a definate feeling of being part of a team. When you get to work you know what the expectations are for the day. You make a plan and carry that out.
good,"Just like any company, Walmart has its issues some locations more than other. The ATL location is working through some pretty sugnificant oportunities  but at least they are working on them."
good,"when i first started walmart everything was going good until i actully got more involved to see what actulluay goes on sometimes other workers would leave during work an never return so there wouldnt be any breaks , i have been in the deli by myself with allot of custumers an nobody did anything"
good,Rest company and environment however they need to really start believing that their competitive advantage is their people and invest more in them... more in their people
good,"I worked there for 22 years in as the Training Coordinator. There were a lot of changes throughout the years, some good and some bad.  Recently pay has improved for new associates but not for long term employees."
good,Walmart can be a fun well fitted environment for its employees it’s about management and how well they keep there employees on trake with there work in the work place.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo solo que su paga es demasiado baja para el labor que se desarrolla
good,The company Walmart at their Trinity Parkway store was extremely wonderful to work for the store manager sometimes could be a little difficult but all of the Assistance supports customer service and regular associates were all a joy to work for and with the availability for advancement is there but you have to pursue it constantly you need to be on top of your game but overall my experience working for them was extremely pleasant and they are all truly missed in my life
good,"At Walmart, if you want anything done, you have to do it yourself and be willing to jump through many hoops. I had to learn through many years of hard work that I had to speak up because no one would for me."
good,"An average day at work would be clocking in, finding a CSM who tells you which register to open, check to see if there are enough bags in the bagging area, signing into the register and making sure your aisle is clean of unnecessary items. Two of the managers at Walmart at the time were very stressed because of all of the people who called in."
good,Fast paced and under time frame but very enjoyable. The customers is great and the majority of the associates is great to work with and to learn and teach to and from.
good,"Convívio social agradável, benefícios que favoreciam os funcionários possibilidade de muito aprendizado , porem infelizmente não ha muitas oportunidades de crescimento profissional."
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart all through high school and college. I was given the opportunity to work in Human Resources, and that opportunity has lead me along the path of a pretty extensive and satisfying HR Career."
good,"Walmart was a great job, although I had to leave due to being unable to receive maternity leave because I hadn't worked there long enough yet. I would love to work in a similar atmosphere."
good,"Didn't mind working here save for the two managers, one of which hates other women and will go so far as to blame the guy's mistakes on them. Management will also force you to work hours you didn't sign up for."
good,"I cant give an accurate rating. As I have not worked there in more than 10 years. What I do remember is a continued effort to be innovative, and a great culture."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work, but I wasn’t getting the hours that I needed or help. I would recommend for anyone under the age of 18 to apply. The job was somewhat unorganized."
good,"Fast paced, mostly friendly environment must be able to smile and not let people get to you or not bring ur own ""bad mood "" to work because you need to have service with a smile. Hours don't split up as in from days or evenings it's kind of all one big shift from am to evening"
good,There is plenty of room to advance in this company if you are willing to endure the politics of retail. The hardest part was the lack of staffing/scheduling throughout the departments. Pay was crazy minimum wage.
good,I was working here for 4 years i leaved a lot with customer service skills and the management system. hardest part is not having time home and working alone at times with no help.
good,"Wal-Mart is a fun place to work and it's very family oriented. Very caring staff. Everyday I looked forward to going to work, instead of dreading going in."
good,"The work itself can be repetitive, but helping customers is a plus. It really just comes down to how you apply yourself and what you're willing to tolerate from others. People make the job and people break the job. I never minded it and the benefits were decent."
good,"If this wasn't just a seasonal opportunity, I would have loved this job. The manager was great, friendly environment, and a competitive opportunity for moving up."
good,"I learned on the job that it is very fast paced and the ability to learn quick needs to be applied especially if you are working in an area of high demand such as dairy, which I happened to work for."
good,Worked for Walmart the last 20 years and good company to work for . Treated me fairly . Salary is fair and the employees are great to work with . Benefits are top notch . Only con is work life balance for management is hard
good,I loved working at walmart from my coworkers to some of the customers that would come in. it is a quick based work enviroment but i loved that because it would help the time go by much faster. i would recommend
good,I'm currently here until I find a higher paying job that's closer to my town. The commute with my car burns so much of my gas and my mileage. I'm barely surviving with this job.
good,"Can't speak for all walmarts, but the one I worked at had great people to work with. It will never pay the bills, but it's a good first or part time job. There's opportunity to grow, if management is a strength of yours."
good,"I loved working at Walmart, my customers my CSM's and the work itself. My favorite part of the day was when I would get customers who would only come into my line for me to wait on them."
good,"I love working for Walmart it’s a job I always wanted but a lot of things have changed since I started, and a lot of the managers there handle and talk to employees any way they so choose. I feel some managers do not give employees the respect we deserve,like they look down upon us. I love the environment overall,the pay is decent and the work is constant but I like to stay busy after all it’s work. I also like the fact that in Walmart u see return customers that are very friendly and also u get chance to meet new people all the time."
good,"I greeted the public as they entered the store,stocked merchandise at "
good,Working at Walmart gave me a new level of respective for grocery stories it can be difficult with the task assigned and the customers but overall I would recommend it.
good,"On a typical day, there is a variety is always something to do.  From making sandwiches in the morning to cleaning at night.  One must be able to complete more than one task at a time competently, to perform well."
good,Wal mart is a good career for structure and using innovation to stay abreast of the retail world.  There is very high expectations of execution and accountability from within.  There are some expectations that are unattainable due to limited labor.
good,Great company but a lot of layoffs the past few years and now mandatory performance evaluation curves in IT.  Feels like goal is to prevent future layoffs and associated costs.  Instead the new approach is to proactively fire associates through performance management initiatives yet these are curve/nbr based leaving some people vulnerable who are actually doing acceptable work..
good,"Wal-mart was very busy and worked towards making the customer first."
good,"it was not the hardest job, but not the easiest. Very physical. but very rewarding. You can have really good days but like any job there can be bad days, just power through them."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. They gave me an opportunity to learn many new things and work with the customers. I liked working one on one with customers and meeting new people.
good,"•Clock in Assign associates their take for the day"
good,"I started with Wal-Mart in 2005, work there for 8 years, before I left and returned in 2015. I like working with my coworkers because they help make it better to me. Its all about who you work with and how you get along with."
good,I like the pace you could work there. Most of the co-workers were fine. The hours were great and some of the management was pretty good. They let me go when my husband had something going on with him and I think that was really nice of them.
good,"Management needs work, be honest with employees and stop lying to their employees, take an interest in their employees and listen to them, there is no job security, you can be fired for the littlest thing, if they dont like you you will be gone shortly"
good,Everything about the job i loved. i worked good hours and was paid good. The only downfall was the management. You are only as good as your management..
good,It was great learned lots and got to teach people on the items they were looking for and how it works as some customers had difficulty understanding how the products works.
good,"Though many of my associates who worked there for much longer didn't seem to agree. I found the work to be fairly easy,  and the breaks are well spread apart."
good,Fast paced workplace where you are production based. Production goals are not unreasonable and the staff is kind and supportive. Management is also pretty understanding and I have yet to have any issues with them.
good,"I enjoy working for Walmart. They give quarterly bonuses, provide for holiday and vacation pay and provide a 401K. The work hours are flexible and my fellow employees are nice to work with."
good,"Walmart is always changing.  New technology and ways of doing business.  If you don't like change, Walmart is not the place to be. Always learning something new."
good,"As long as you do your job you can do well. very strict on attendance, but management is pretty flexible if a special request for time off is needed. ."
good,My experience with Wal-Mart for the most past was filled with stress from assisting many customers at once as expected working at most walmart. You are often flooded with people asking questions or looking to buy items or asking about said items they are buying as well as maintaining your workspace there to ensure it is cleam with the certain specifics to each departments needs. It is very important that you know the details of things within yoir own departments aisles to ensure you can provide the best experience and assistance to customers and their needs.
good,"I had a good time each day I worked. The physical labor was somewhat difficult, but I got used to it. I met nice people and liked my job. However, the scheduling system by the store manager was somewhat discriminatory towards minors. This is why I had to leave, because I was not getting nearly enough hours. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. The most enjoyable was the people."
good,Great co workers but long days and managers are usually unprofessional. pay wasnt enough for the amount of work and they play favorites with the hours that are worked.
good,Walmart is a good job to work I enjoyed working there the customers were nice the associates were nice also some time it seem like there were to many managers
good,has wonderful benefits. A lot of people always want to turn away because its Walmart but the starting pay is good and also the benefits are amazing. plus you feel like a family there
good,"I liked my job. I worked at two different Stores. I did assembly of bikes, BBQs, furniture etc. and Maintenance. I had great mangers, they always listened to me. Left to seek new opportunities."
good,i learned alot about how things work at walmart. how food comes in and how produce are stocked and pulled. i cleaned daily before my shift ended and the managers was some what helpful
good,"Working as AP for Walmart defiantly has it's perks as well as it's cons. It's more laid back then the other positions and you get to have a better relationship with management. The pay is great considering I don't have a college degree. Safety and compliance are easy to take care of. However, making apprehensions can be dangerous."
good,Pretty easy and relaxing job. Everybody was respectful to each other. Some customers will be difficult but nothing to stress about. Christmas discounts was awesome!
good,we work everyday and I learnt much things at walmart. we serve customers very well and we enjoy our work. Iam verry glad  to work at walmart and i like my job.
good,"Walmart was a good job to start with, after a while they cut hours and that is why I left. Overall they have good managers, that work with you for any inconvenience."
good,The people and most of the customers were a joy to work with. You could work in different departments as cover. It was an enjoyable place to work and made a lot of lasting friendships.
good,Spent my days talking to customers about how they viewed the deli and would make changes based on how the customers felt they wanted their service met. Management would be very avoided of the deli for some reason.
good,"The store was doing good and I came in as a dry goods stocker and was moved into frozen goods. Ended up becoming frequently sick because of weather and being in the freezer. Had issues where experienced employees where put and my section and would refuse to work and when a manager would show, would blame the new guy (me)."
good,"Always something to be done at walmart ther never a dull moment when u can relax sometimes."
good,"Good job, faily good pay, long hours, hard work, no paid time off, mandatory to work holidays and night shifts. Work hard more money. Management was very rude."
good,I liked it but to many management changes. The work enviroment was safe and fun. The other associates where always willing to help with any problem solving.
good,"it was stressful...they nit pik at new employees seems to me.i loved my job it was just that some of the managers were very unprofessional,,,seem they"
good,"Empresa focada em resultados,( redução de custos e despesas) "
good,"I just want to do something better, I have a talent I would like to use somehow "
good,Walmart is a great place to improve your career if thats what you want. They will work with you to help promote up and learn everything you can to do so.
good,Hard work with hard working great people. Some of the hardest working people I know work here. Dedicated team that helps one another and strives for excellence. Proud to have worked with them all.
good,Very friendly team oriented environment. Customers are friendly and As well as coworkers and Management very clean and organized. I would  definitely work for this company again. Walmart superstore is the pillar of the community By doing fundraising for local schools also Great with holiday season
good,"The overall time i worked there the management was awful sometimes they will be there when you need them but most times there to busy for the small people to help with the abundant work load which will stress people out or when things need to be looked at by a manager personally."
good,Walmart is a great place to until you get sick. Or you need to call out. They hours are okay for the most part and the employee never mind helping when they can
good,"Good environment, always seen new faces in the area which was nice. Must be a people person in order to be a cashier, always have a great attitude. Some troubling customers but a CM was always there to help."
good,"unloaded multiple trucks daily and then was assigned an isle to stock. management was okay sometimes expected you to do two jobs at once, and tried to make you stay over."
good,Walmart has a great culture and has great career opportunities. Company is centered around its employees. Constantly growing and trying to improve for the customers.
good,"Great experience and work ethics, learned many educational skills and also enjoyed working as a team. Experience new fields in which I excelled and apply in my every day living."
good,"The job itself really isn't bad. Basic organizational skills and people skills are used. but you will often come into contact with some of the worst people you will likely meet in your life, and this will cause mental strain and fatigue."
good,Walmart is an okay place to work but the pay does not seem to match the amount of labor that most jobs intell I personally believe Walmart can do way better than they are when it comes to salary
good,"Dependendo do cargo , o dia passa rápido... Os direitos do funcionário são respeitados , e a carga horária é razoável."
good,I usually have a very stressful work environment but when the customer flow slows down it can also be fun to work with your fellow associates. Great team building and communication building environment.
good,"Walmart was a place of buisness with great management, flexible schedules, and career opportunities. A typical day would be as to help customers look for items. I've learned that hard work will pull off if you put dedication to it. The hardest part of my job was when employees called off. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking items."
good,Overall duties are to follow the planograms of the modular sheet and change and put in correct shelving and fixtures. And make sure your work assignment are completed by the time your shift ends
good,"Hours will drop for a week or two, during hiring/ training times, to give to new hires. Afterward hours increase back to 30-40 per wk. "
good,"People need help with chip card payments. I would walk around & help them, to speed up the process. I was helpful and friendly, most people responded."
good,"i worked for Wal-Mart for 5 years, with in those years i learned a lot got promotions and raises. yes its very fast paced company. there is never a dull moment. management does thank you for a job well done and all the hard work. the only hard thing is to keep up with supply and demand on merchandise. but i did love the challenge."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, they taught me a Lot of things about Retail.. so I could succeed in most any department. I especially love the 10 ft.rl."
good,"Muy buena experiencia en lo personal, se preocupan del trabajador ademas de exigir resultados"
good,"I helped to set up the store in Lemmon Valley before it opened.  The group of us that started out there from the very beginning were like a team, and a family.  That part was awesome. There were also a lot of great customers that frequented the store, and I developed my ""regular"" customers who would always come through my check stand.  It was, however, a very disorganized store.  Also, very stressful much of the time.  It was a good learning experience however."
good,"al igual que en mi trabajo anterior trate con los clientes y los compañeros de trabajo, trabajo en equipo y responsabilidad a la hora de atender al cliente"
good,"I pick and dispense groceries for Online Grocery Pickup. I never know what I am actually going to be doing when I show up and they have changed my schedule many times since I started, but I finally have the same days off every week. You have to be willing to learn and talk to customers whether you are picking or dispensing groceries. Most of the time they are friendly, but you will have customers that won't be happy until they have made you miserable."
good,"Good benefits. "
good,"The comradery was very good.  Nice, friendly people who care about their customers.  Enjoyed working with the customers and my coworkers.  I learned how to balance all the tasks at hand."
good,Walmart is very competitive and fast paced. I'm currently a department manager at a Neighborhood Market. There never seems to be enough hours in the day to complete your tasks.  But I enjoy staying busy.  The only downfall I experience is poor management and their lack of communication.  They work against each other and then wonder why nothing gets done.
good,"Start off the day with a meeting, associates get divided up for tasks, work freight, help customers. I learned that you have to be able to do everything to make yourself of value to them."
good,"I was passed over so many times to women for positions on management.  Then those same women were sent to me to train them for their new position.  Also, managers are too loose with associates.  I would advise newcomers that don't want to work to become friends with their direct salaried member of management.  I did not do that.  I let my work and results speak for me."
good,I worked for this company for over 10 years and in many different positions and stores. I loved the fast pace and constantly changing environment. I enjoyed my coworkers and the team mentality required to complete tasks. Customer service is exciting and there is always someone to help and tasks to be done. Sometimes work/life balance is hard when you are in management because of the demanding hours and schedule. But it is a great job for experience and learning. Most of the managers are great and work together well. The company policies are restrictive sometimes and do not take into account that every store is different.
good,"It was nice working there if you are up late, can walk around consistently, and are willing to work fixed hours. Other then that their benefits are pretty good and they pay good as well."
good,The management sucked and liked to play favorites. I often felt bullied by my supervisors. There was little to no security. Anyone could walk in at anytime and rob you or steal what they wanted. If they stole stuff the associates were the ones who pay for it by not getting any bonuses.
good,Good company to begin work experience & for employment  growth & promoting. Great w. Working w. schedules nomatter what. Only thing that if sales go down over night be ready to get bumped for 30-15 hrs a week overnight babysitting. Now there might be a spot just a matter of first come first.
good,A lot of fun people to work with. Management we're good people and if you weren't they left you alone. A lot of fun people what come in at night time.
good,"Walmart was my dream first job, so when I happened to get hired there as my first job, I was ecstatic. I soon came to realize that while I had fun working there some days, it was a complete and utter nightmare on others. Later at night there tends to be little to no coverage and that is usually when we got the onslaught of customers coming in just before dinner/after dinner. We'd have about two regular lines, the Tobacco line, and then the self-check outs open. Stressful doesn't even begin to describe the day to day activities. Management is very rarely willing to jump on the registers, nor does their ""Open-door"" policy mean anything. Great hours... sometimes. Other times, you are lucky to get any. Managers very rarely have their associates backs which is highly disappointing."
good,"Walmart , is a fun place to work. I help costumers find what they need. I Supervise the Modular team. I also stock cosmetics to fulfill the costumers needs for products needed."
good,A lot of on the job training. I worked as an Optician for 5 1/2 years and learned so much from measurements to troubleshooting. It was a great experience.
good,"You clock in and starting bringing the shopping carts in. When a customer needs an appliance such as furniture,you help them with it.Sometimes the carts are hard to get inside for the crowds."
good,Everybody was so nice and friendly I worked 8 hours a day had two 15 minutes break which went by so fast and then I had an hour lunch break I worked 30-40 hours a week
good,Need better work life balance to retain long term associates. Great advancement if you put in the work. Great bonus structure for salaried management.
good,I was young and just needed a job at the time. I think it is a good job for a young person or even a part time job. I had bigger plans. I work her for a year .
good,"Working as an APA it is hard to progress because there is only one route of advancement to take. However, pay is higher than most, if not all, hourly positions."
good,"Although the work load can get hectic sometimes, walmart expect management to help and solve the problem. this in turn helps managers to make decision based on ground situations, rather following documentations."
good,Great opportunity for advancement to manager position from hourly or driver group. Training provided via mentorship and classroom setting. Family focused culture.
good,"•	Developed, implemented and monitored programs to maximize customer satisfaction. Provided detailed monthly departmental reports and updates to senior management. Addressed negative customer feedback immediately. Effectively communicated with team members to maintain clearly defined expectations. Resolved customer questions, issues and complaints."
good,"A typical work was rather straight forward, and for the most part steady paced."
good,"Tuesday , In Walmart I learned how to stock and assemble bikes and worked as casher in the garden center. The management was great there. Work place was very hard working . finding stuff that you don't know where it is. helping people."
good,Work at Walmart is good and is a good company to work for temporary or even to start a career. It can be challangjmg at times but the pay off is rewarding. Management could improve but overall is pretty ok.
good,Probably a good job to start off and it will fit greatly for those whom are of mature age and elderly. Working nights is great only for people who like working into a sweat.
good,"This company is great to work for but the store I am in has a few things missing to really want to make me stay. Typical work days are throwing freight on shelves and helping customers. I have learned many things from this company including: management skills, improving work performance and ethics in others as well as my self. The hardest thing about the job is that a normal worker gets treated very unfairly but management sometimes."
good,Ok place to work i would have good days and bad but for most part i had a good experience working there. I liked the things they did for the employees during holiday season
good,decent place to work . Some of the management didnt have people skills but luckily you didnt have to see them all the time. coworkers were great to work with.
good,A typical day at work started out by pulling freight to the floor to work it. Customers will ask us for assistance finding groceries and to possibly reach something from the top shelf. It is always a fast paced job from the time we arrive until time to leave. The Cap Team always go to lunch and breaks together because we work as a team. We learn on a daily basis about how top stock is done correctly to where a specific item goes on the shelf. Management stays on your toes to make sure the job gets done. The hardest part of the job is probably getting everything done when there is a lot of freight some days. The most enjoyable part of the job is making friends with the other cap team members and making sure the customers are satisfied.
good,"Empresa transnacional por lo que hay futuro, desarrollo,y  buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,opportunities for advancement if you work stay committed to the job.  Management will notice hard workers and will give opportunities to you.  Not a Monday through Friday job.
good,"Wal-Mart is a structured company with an efficient selection of management. While employed at Walmart, they provided their employees with consistent scheduling. However, they do not have the most flexible hours even when giving two week notice. I appreciate the job, and they provide many opportunities to matriculate to a higher position."
good,Working at Wal-Mart was great. I was there for seven years and got to experience every department and meet a vast amount of people. If customer service is your type of work then Wal-Mart just might be for you.
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work if u like dealing with lots of people and different personalities and attitudes. Training takes time, it is all down electronically and after the training you are prepare for the field."
good,"I love working with my associates and developing them to further their careers or simply provide an enjoyable working experience while they navigate through school. Retail work is ever-changing and challenging, especially with new technology and customers who do not wish to adopt the changes. Time and patience are needed in order to transition customers and associates alike. Being part of a team, working together, delegating, and watching the benefits of hard work are all very rewarding."
good,"Mostly I would start my job by getting a row of shopping carts from the side of the store through a small garage door and pull them in. Next from the start of the shift, 8:00 PM, to lunch, 12:30 AM, I would be full of work checking people's reciepts and overall look for anyone trying to steal merchandise. After lunch things would slow things down to a crawl when no one was around from 2:00 AM to 5:00AM seeing that no one was coming and I often wondered why we were opened 24 hours if no one would come in around those hours. Finally the last two hours 6:00 - 7:00 AM people would come in and get the groceries before the big rush of customer would come in and I would give the morning greeter the job and head home for some much needed sleep."
good,"After a few short months of working as a cashier,  I was offered a sales associate position. I was afforded the opportunity to prove my work ethics and dedication. I received an outstanding evaluation, and would've been considered for a promotion to the management team had I continued my employment. I also had personal family issues during my time off employment.  All of my immediate management staff,  including the store manager were completely understanding and helpful.  One of the best experiences of employment, working for this company."
good,A typical day will consist of helping customers within the h\the home department along with assisting the nearby sections of the store. I learned communication skills and that interaction with customers is important. Managment is well around the store with things always being taken care of by the supervisors/managers. The workplace culture is good and also had a nice vibe from everybody. The hardest part of the job was relocating items and some sales were a bit tough. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with getting the things they need and it makes me feel proud after each sale made.
good,"At one time I was able to work 7 days a week to pay off the immense medical bills for my son's hospitalization.  Now Walmart has decided not to give overtime hours, leaving some pharmacies without an adequate amount of pharmacy technicians to complete the job, or at some times, no pharmacy technician present.  Those coming in the next morning are required to do the tasks that were not completed the day before.  This creates additional stress on the first shift technicians."
good,If I had one issue it's that the person coming in off the street could be started out at the same rate of pay as someone who had worked there for more than a year.
good,"Working at walmart has its ups and downs, sometimes you can have a fun easy day, sometimes its a slog to get through the day and get home. Mostly it was just fine working there though."
good,depending on the manager you work under it is a great job. nice people and excellent benefits. I really liked working there except for the manager over my department.
good,Compensation is low. Relaxed atmosphere. Company offers discounts on purchases.  Health insurance is affordable.  Company offers good investment opportunities.
good,Very competitive company. Customer service is key. I've learned customer service skills and merchandising skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy.
good,Wal-Mart is a good consistent job. On the down side it can be stressful and you need awesome customer service to deal with the good and the bad. I would Still recommend this job.
good,"Beneficial employee salaries and benefits with a work environment that exhibits organization, cleanliness, outstanding merchandise, and availability to shop at your convenience. "
good,It was hectic during the holidays but besides that its not bad. They wirk with what you give them and there's always hours available to work if needed
good,You pick orders as fast as possible and you learn to drive heave Equipment and must work safe and dress warm depending what part your in the mangers there work with you to get you where you need to be
good,"It’s a pretty good job. Paid time off , benefits, and a  flexible schedule. Management is terrible sometimes not all the time. Overall it’s all about you."
good,Some days it was super slow and I had to find things to do and some days it was chaos but that's what I like. Coworkers and customers could be really nice and easy to get along with but then you would have that 1 or 2 that is snotty and rude. Very flexible place to work at; they will work with you. But there are certain times in the year that are too slow business wise so they cut hours. Besides that I liked working there and would go back.
good,"They had me working a lot during my time at Walmart, which made me feel like part of the team. They helped me out when I needed help, they showed me the ropes for everything I needed to know to become successful."
good,"For the specific job, I was paid well enough to live stably, my manager worked around my classes, I always had hours, majority of coworkers were nice."
good,"My Managers are courteous and approachable, kind and helpful."
good,To be honest i got bored working as a cart associate. I usually spend all day doing nothing doing the weekdays. Overstaffed on the week days but understaffed on the weekends. so that kinda sucked. The pay was good tho.
good,"Well, for the most part a typical day for me at the time started out with, hoping nobody called off that day because if they did you know you were screwed. If they didnt then still you knew you were screwed anyway, with t he new system they implemented years back the stocking the majority of the freight is left to the second shift crew and where I worked we had little worked when other stores had 2x the amount of workers. With that you were always threatened with losing your jobs if you didn't perform up to standards by management."
good,"As a cashier the work was very fast paced, especially on weekends. You could choose the hours you wanted to work or have a flexible schedule if your availability was open. PTO is available, you get a raise every year and they start you out at $11/hr now. Management was great at working with you and what you needed and very understanding, but very slow at helping you switch departments. The new management now over cashiers is terrible. You also only get 10% off your purchase (excluding grocery items). Would not recommend being a cashier for Walmart but would definitely recommend working for a great company like this."
good,Fast paced working environment.  Good employees and flexible schedules.  Not enough flexibility on full time work.  Good atmosphere of customer service and customers.
good,"Since the locations of stores and the areas and culture around them can vary so vastly, its hard to get a good review on this company as a whole.  I've been at the same store for 3 years and I've moved from overnight to a department manager with really no complaints."
good,"When ever a deadline needed to be met in any area of the store we pulled the resources together to accomplish the task."
good,I start work by stock milk and eggs. Cleaning the area as I go. Then record what was damaged. Finally I would stock the shelves til it was time to go. That is what it is like for a normal day. If a coworker is sick I will be asked to work mornings or be given extra hours to work. None of this is really a problem for me. The support managers are great to work with and will reschedule me when I ask.
good,Nesta empresa obtive a oportunidade de apreender  vai funções  fui de operadora de caixa a auxiliar administrativo  com a oportunidade  de desenvolver  funções  diversas  .
good,"I believe Walmart's culture is changing back to realize that they have to have happy employees to make happy customers, the corporation is making strides to making it a competitive place to work"
good,"Work nights with Wal-mart is easy-going and fast-paced."
good,"Fun place, decent management pays good, family staff.Laid back great hours learn everything i wanted typically a good job one of the best i had benefits good"
good,"greeting everyone, punching in depending the volume how face we move some busy days some relaxed paced"
good,Walmart is a good employer if your not really looking to advance. They only hire part time but if you ask management for more hours you can start working full time hours after your done training. 12 weeks of 32+ hours makes you full time. Benefits are not shabby but holidays off are rare.
good,Fast paced and always changing.  I'll be honest the weak will struggle in upper level positions.  You have be willing to learn and dedicated to achieving excellence.  The standards are extremely high.
good,"A typical day at work I have to run the register, run the computer to look up past work orders and tires sizes and prices, also run the hand held to write up the cars for service, occassionally work on the cars, Stock shelves, and do whatever I'm asked to do."
good,Just have to be flexible in your availability to get the hours to maintain full time.  Other than that I've had a good time there.  Its really like any other decent workplace.
good,My days working at Walmart were great. I had a chance to help customers out with looking for the items they needed. Management was always helpful and there when you needed them.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, especially when it is a busy day. The customers are treated with respect. I believe when it is a busy day, more lanes should be open to speed checkout time."
good,"Observed safety and Environment rules ensure safety is number one."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walmart. The offered one on one hep when needed and even gave relocation options within the company if need be. Despite the pay, its a great place to work."
good,"Es una empresa en la que se puede desarrollar profesionalmente, considera mucho la estabilidad emocional y familiar, cuenta con un amplio sistema y una gran organización."
good,Walmart provided great benefits and job security with as many hours as you needed in the week. But they lack in assignments to do and the days drag on while you're there
good,it was a good place to work and you get an employee discount if you shop there as well. the people most of them were down to earth and the environment was great.
good,I worked in lawn and garden it was a learning experience as well as a busy and face paced with lots of task needed daily. Liked the associates and management was good
good,"Nice place to work, friendly environment with friendly people. Gets pretty stressful at times, but what job doesn't? Overall, cool place to work. Hardest part of the job is being told to do multiple multiple orders. I'm only 1 person so that makes it pretty stressful. Most enjoyable part is working with some very friendly coworkers as well as customers."
good,"Great place to get started and learn skills for the workplace, or, in my case working with cars.  The pay living in an area with a higher cost of living felt minimal which prompted a desire to move onwards and upwards from Walmart, but I worked with much more exceptional people than the companies reputation would have you expect."
good,"desarrollo de habilidades, descuentos y convenios con otras empresas"
good,Working at Walmart as a Stock Clerk required time management. I learned to complete tasks quickly. The hardest part was maintaining a steady speed to complete multiple tasks before the shift was over. Management was reliable when needed in many different situations and always helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was frequent breaks through the night. Frequent breaks were very necessary for the time spent working and standing on our feet. After a long period of standing it began to become overwhelming.
good,There is always something to do which is great.  No two days are ever the same.  There is a lot required of an associate which requires a lot of training.  Moving up is usually pretty easy of you try and work hard.
good,"long days"
good,"Walmart has great benefits, and compensation plans. The work environment is fast paced. The best part about working for this company has been helping customers, and meeting new people."
good,I work in the cold storage Warehouse. They provide you with the proper gear to keep yourself warm. It was fast paced and you never knew exactly when you'd be done filling orders for the day but they paid you well.
good,"There is nothing hard about the job. I just maintained a clean parking lot, and I gathered up all the carts in the parking lot and made sure the customers had their carts when they came, Also i helped out inside whenever someone needed assistance. I loved my job. I like to work and make people happy!"
good,"I don't know but when i work there it was more flexible hour."
good,good day nice people. went smooth when you know what you are doing. management was all over the place hardest part was being set up efficiently. customers were nice.
good,This store is definitely the best Walmart. The store manager is amazing and is willing to put in time and effort into you if you are willing to learn and grow.
good,"My job was in the inventory and stocking of product. It was a fast paced and high deadline job. It had a lot of physical stress to your body with lots of lifting, bending and overhead work."
good,Walmart was ok to work for since I was in college at the time and wanted to make money.  It was great building relationships with the customers that came in the store.
good,"Very flexible with hours worked, I learned alot working for this company excellent training in areas I had the desire to learn about and to gain knowledge in the career path."
good,"As with any larger type retail store, there is a higher turnover rate. In retail you will work nights and weekends, no exceptions. If you like working as a team and working in customer service field this is a good fit for you. A benefit of the job is that you can in most cases cross train in almost every department. A disadvantage of the job working nights and weekends and not getting time off when you'd like it."
good,"It was great, safe and easy place to work in surrounded by hard working people and nice management. Hours are great, love  helping customers out, safe place and a clean environment for employees and especially the custome and by saying customers they are the main focal point why the employees work so hard and keep a safe environment  is to assist our number one custumer"
good,Great place to learn different attributes. Great job security ensure you can get benefits.Great experience for someone who wants to move up in retail.
good,No day is the same as the last. Learned customer service knowledge and how to handle situations on the fly. Hardest part is when people call in and cause the store to be understaffed.
good,"Working at Walmart was nice. I enjoyed my job as a Cashier, however, they are very particular on there scheduling and it is all computer based witch is not the best way to do scheduling because computers can glitch out, and get everything messed up."
good,The only thing I can say is I liked the people I worked with and some of the customers that I helped in the pharmacy. The work was very stressful and not enough pay.
good,They expect you to work on your feet and work fast. I have learned to don't stop working keep the fast pace. If you need help just ask another worker or manager.
good,"my typical day at work consisted of assisting customer in finding products, or solutions to problems. Every employee was fun to work with great environment"
good,"I moved up quickly with Walmart, the management team at the store noticed my leadership abilities and gave me the opportunity to promote within a short amount of time.   It is fast paced, demanding work within structured time frames.   Depending on the positions worked depends on the demands of the job, both physically and mentally.  It is hard work, but it is fun and is a family environment.  There is plenty of opportunity to promote if you are motivated, energetic and willing to learn new things."
good,"A typical day as work was always fun I enjoy my fellow associates but management didn't have any respect towards cashiers I say cashiers because that's the only department I worked in. When it came down to the working environment it would be freezing in the winter and burning hot in the summer, customers would even complain. Walmart didn't really teach me anything special it just gave me something extra to put on my resume more customer service skills because I found myself working in warehousing a lot.  the hardest part about the job.. was keeping your composer especially when your getting treated wrong other than that I did my job professionally never had a problem out of any of my customers. the best part of the job was helping people from different races, I enjoyed being helpful."
good,you meet new people everyday. There is plenty of advancement whether you want to stay in the same store or relocate. Provide you with the necessary tools so you can perform your everyday tasks
good,A good way to learn customer service.  Met a lot of people.  Learned a lot about my job positions and those around me.  I enjoyed my job however had to relocate.
good,It's a great place to work. There can be room for advancement and benefits. Good management team and co-workers.The job culture is very good and can be balanced.
good,What can be said? I went to work did my job and left. The only interesting part of the day was that it usually was not the same for the most part. You are left to your own accord just make sure things are done.
good,The job at Wal-mart was very fast pace because of the Christmas season.  I am a people person so I do enjoy meeting different folks. I counted it a privilege working for them.
good,"Good team work in the department i worked in, we followed our normal daily routine acting upon each of our roles to ensure the daily tasks run as smoothly as possible without any mishaps."
good,Lots of non-enjoyable days. too much new ideas implemented with not much changes in resources. Mgmt need to understand the passion of the employees is degrading
good,I first started as a temp worked my way up. I always worked all over the store. Everyone is friendly and kind. I learned a lot at Walmart. Clean fast and friendly .
good,"Fun environment. Fun coworkers, most customers are chill. Others are very rude. Based on the hours your working for a day, your break could be long it short"
good,While the work day can stagger at times; you can typically find something to do. Very friendly co-workers and managers although management seemed to struggle. Pay was good for the role and they work with your school schedule or life in general.
good,"I would walk to the back and clock in, and go and find my manager and find out what was on the agenda for the day to see if any tv's needed to be pulled from the back to fill the stock, Then i would work the floor and help customers,"
good,"Learned to manage time and work effectively in a fast-paced environment, learned to efficiently stock and handle customers in a packed environment, learned to pay attention to detail and become more flexible."
good,"walmart is a good company to work for the only problem i had was with some of the managers and associates at my store"
good,The atmosphere is very friendly and positive. Lots of new people to meet. Very relaxed work pace no rush at all. Everyone is treated very fair no stress.
good,I worked for 24-7 InTouch for over 4 years in total. It was a great place to work and learn the customer service skills that I have acquired. The only bad thing about the company was the attendance policy they held. It was not realistic to any one who had family or medical issues after a 5 day. They also required you to work holidays with no extra pay and you would be fired if you called in that day.  You are unable to miss work if you have any emergencies in your daily  life . Besides that they had a great work environment and fantastic leadership. The also gave many opportunities to train and advance yourself.
good,"advancement is mostly seniority based. So there's that, unless you can impress the right people."
good,This place isn't that bad actually. just needs some new responsible mangers and it would be great. No real issues really. only Denver is very high to live.
good,"Nice place to work"
good,Job performance is evaluated by meeting production rates set for processing freight. Safety is a much talked about subject. My managers are very helpful .
good,Worked there 10 years I loved my job in customer service. My goal was to provide customers with happy attitude and great service. When they come in unhappy it was my goal to have them leave happy.
good,Great place for part-time work to help with the costs of school. Able to advance in certain areas of work like from cashier to CSM or ZSM.  Every work day is different depending on staffing.
good,"I  was kept  busy cleaning the bathrooms the break room and emptying the trash .Making my rounds on the sales floor and cleaning up any messes. Checking out side of the store sweeping "
good,"Since I have worked at walmart, they haven't been able to keep a strong manager that can also keep a full-time staff. This makes it very hard on the dependable employee."
good,I enjoyed working there at Wal-Mart.  My co workers were always friendly and willing to work with me.  Managers always seemed to make time and help if I needed any questions answered and very understanding about my home problems.
good,"fun and coworkers were cooperative.Care for each other.There is need for pay increment. Also, Time allotment was too small. There was no enough take home pay after 2 weeks of work."
good,I very much enjoyed my time working with this company. If given the opportunity I definitely would like to be employed with them once again. Id recommend anyone to apply for a job position with Walmart.
good,"stock shelves,clean area help customer if you do work giving to you manger won't bother you.Can do more work than other employees if needed.Have to learn telxon and mc40.Can also bin overstock.Hardest part was when customer upset and yells at you.Just smile and try to help them"
good,I had the privilege to help open a Neighborhood Market. I had a great experience building up new patient accounts and maintaining their business. I was given excellent support for program implementation.
good,Mi trabajo era auxiliar operativo y para llegar a este puesto me costo porque y se un proyecto de como mejorar la empresa en cálida y economía xq los gerente no te querian soltar de su aria de ellos te querían tener a la fuerza y eso pz no era justo x eso uno trabaja duro para que lo reconozcan y ni eso asen reconocen a los que no se lo merense y los que le hechan mas ganas los olvidan
good,not as bad as some say just depends on where and with who u work different job placement available and promotions possible can always learn new things so you wont get bored with walmart
good,Walmart is a great place to work in but I believe Walmart should be more flexible with schedules and protection for their employees from nasty customers.
good,"The hardest aprt about working there, was stocking shelves over the height limit without being reprimanded for it, the work place culture was fairly decent, I didn't have issues with outside customers or m own asscociates. the management for the most part besides the ones that gave me a fighting chance is sub-par at best & could use work."
good,There are certain stereotypes that are in every Walmart. Be prepared for anything. We maintain a family atmosphere. I’d advise working in a Neighborhood Market over a Supercenter.
good,Walmart is a nice place to work for. They were flexible with your scheduling and willing to listen to any and all concerns. It was a real team environment.
good,"Walmart is a great starting opportunity for people who are just stepping into the work force, looking for a career, or just need a stable job. Since (all or most) Walmarts have raised their starting pay, they has made it much easier and comfortable.  They provide a great deal of benefits (dental & medical, PTO, discounts, 401k, stocks, and Sam's Club membership are just to name a few) and they are always looking to hire. They even provide free checking accounts with the store's own bank for those who don't already have one and would like to. They also have the Vet4Hire program where honorably discharged veterans can apply and get hired on quickly. It felt good to be recognized for my service not only by customers but my job as well. This is me second time working for Walmart and it's definitely been good for me."
good,"Outside of some issues with shift scheduling due to the store being understaffed, Walmart was a great company to work for. Management was top notch and considerate, an increasingly rare find these days."
good,"Typical day is busy."
good,"I worked at the neighborhood market in Leonard, TX. I hated it when I found out they were being shut down. I miss my old boss and when they tried to relocate to a different Walmart where I could do the same thing I was doing in Leonard. It was just too far away, I couldn’t do it."
good,its a good place to work and have benefits etc also as long as you are doing your job everything will be fine but some days they will have you to do stuff thats not in your job title
good,I worked for the company for over five years and held positions from pushing carts to salaried management. In that time I learned many customer service skills and how to run a business.  The environment is very fast paced and there is always something to do.The company provides many opportunities for personal growth and career advancement to those who show the aptitude.
good,"Buena experiencia."
good,busy day making sure all clients experience was excellent weather i was working maintenance or on the floor helping the deli with clients making sure clients were served at a timely matter
good,"É uma empresa que ensina muitas coisas, você sai de lá uma pessoa mais responsável e sempre tem gente para te ajudar a crescer na empresa"
good,"Have worked for 10 years at Walmart. I would say that the company has improved drastic, When I first started the wages were below standard but now any associate can make a better living with the current wages. Technology has played a huge component for Walmart to improve the workplace. Great place to work for."
good,"Leadership team awesome knowledge, consistent processes across the network.  Great job promoting from within and does an outstanding job retaining their associates."
good,Good place to work though not many would agree with my assessment. Employees help customers whether we want it or not. Fast-paced yet comfortable to be in.
good,"Overall great part time job, especially if you are a college student, they'll work with your schedule. Great place to gain experience from multiple areas of retail and management."
good,the employees were all nice and spoke to each other they encouraged you to try and progress in your careeer . But you havet to wanna work hard and do good for yourself.
good,Wal-mart like all jobs have ups and down. I like working there but I do not get enough hours and cost of living is high so I think the pay could go up
good,Overall working at Walmart is good for you in the future because it’s a good jobs to begin with because you learn and grow from it. It’s a fast paced working environment
good,You can learn a lot about what happens in retail. So much of what you learn and where you go is dependent on your store manager. Lots of opportunities.
good,My typical starts at 10:00p.m. ends at 7:00a.m. I have learn you can't trust management . respect the individual . the hardest part of my is to deal with the attitude of mangers.the most enjoyable thing is i have a job and i am doing something right for 18yrs.
good,working at Walmart was a job that was stressful as a front end cashier and some of the customers were horrible to deal with but I had the best bosses ever and great people to work with.  The store manager was kind of a pain
good,"My time there was great. It is a great company to work for, especially if you are competitive and looking for advancement. My experience was a good one."
good,When I worked at Walmart I had a lot of friends who I enjoyed seeing all the time. I enjoyed being around the customers and making sure they had a good experience.
good,Good place to work.  People are good.  Has nice culture.  Has cafeteria to buy food.  Has free sodas. Has free coffee.  Has free tea.  has snacks and fruit.
good,I was a rotating relief pharmacist for several locations within a 90 minute drive from my home.  It was difficult at times at the same time is exciting to work in different locations.
good,I enjoyed my time there but i was young and dumb and left at a point in my life where i thought what i was pursuing was gonna make my dreams come true. Also two of my managers there made me feel really under appreciated and etc. blah blah blah. Earthier way  I regret leaving because i barely have any money now and making ends meet are now very difficult. Needless to say its a great job to have when you're young but if you expect to make it a career don't expect to live a lavish lifestyle.
good,"The community was the best part for me, I worked with many friends of mine and created friendships along the way. It is an easy job for teenagers but can be stressful at times. Like any job, it is what you make it."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service skills at Walmart. How to handle situations differently. Management at Walmart is very strict. You have a lot of rules to follow, The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers, and making sure the customers were satisfied."
good,Its a good place to work but it get stressful at times when your co worker sit back and watch you work and you end up have to complete your manager's work.
good,"I worked for 3 different stores, on and off, for almost 12 years. In that time, I have come to hold a certain level of respect and awe for the management teams at each store. From the lowest hourly managers all the way up to salaried managers, they manage to make you feel like you are one of the family. Of all the bad things I could put on here about working for Walmart, they are far, far outweighed by the fact that, no matter how bad your home-life is getting, if you go to your manager and explain what's going on, they will work with you to make sure you don't end up unemployed, as well."
good,I didn't lIke how when they hired people on for there seasonal stuff they choose people who had family working there. The environment was amazing all the associate were helpful and made us all feel like part of there team even though we were only temppray emplyees.
good,Very important role there as a stocker. I mean that without a stocker you never have anything on the selves. espescailly such a great  big store such as Walmart.
good,Good place to work. I deal with lots of people and handle a lot of money.Management is good and caring. Most co-workers are like family. Very low stress and accommodating.
good,"Cashier: You know, your typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart... dealing with cranky customer service managers. "
good,"I'd say the most typical day at work for me would be making production and carrying out daily cleaning/cooking duties. Management was okay, could be better, could be worse. Hardest part for me was waking us that early. Most enjoyable part was the people and their personalities that I got to experience."
good,"If you need a job where you get a lot of hours, Walmart can typically make that work. They aren't super flexible with off time, but that's the tradeoff for getting so many hours."
good,Everyday was fast paced with filling orders. Some days you might have a small order only and some days you had a tall order and hit every spot in the area.  Over all it was a good place
good,It was Nice place to work at there was only one mean person bujt there are always that one person you dont get along with but overall it was a great experience
good,Work was good. Learned team skills as well as always looking for things to be done. I learned about my job and what a days work feels like. It was hard but good.
good,I loved working for Walmart. It was very competitive and fast paced which I loved. Everyone that I worked with was very nice.The managers were extremely understanding.
good,"Having great customer service is a must for this job. The coworkers are pretty cool, and so is management for the most part. They do have a hard time giving people raises so beware."
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart. I loved the customer relationships and the associate that I worked with and for. They were also very flexible with my work schedule.
good,"My first job was gathering carts and bringing them in to the store, I enjoyed doing this because I often worked outside.. After 6 months I was transferred to the back room and helped unload the freight to their areas.  After working for 3 years in this area, I transferred to Garden/Seasonal, here I would keep the plants watered, displayed properly and the area organized. During the various seasonal holidays or back to school, we were given the task of displaying products, keeping them stocked, organized and presentable to the customer."
good,"The work was busy with good employee relations. Always something new to learn or different task per day. Assistant managers were easy to get along with and helpful. the hardest part of this job was trying to keep up with the ever changing roles. The other employees were easy to get along with. I learned how to do order picks and overstock binning, how to uses a telxon and cash register along with gun sales and mixing paint. A typical day consisted of greeting customers, sales, stocking shelves, cleaning, doing order picks and binning overstock that wouldn't go on the shelves. Management was easy to talk to and engaging."
good,It's a wonderful place to work the pay was great the management was bad they will lie on you in a heartbeat. When you would go to higher management about what was going on they would act like nothing happened
good,They see employees true potential and promote them to what they fit best and have the best skills for the job. For example i was employed for a month and was promoted to head supervisor cause of my drive to work at 100% to better the employees and the company.
good,"el trabajar en walmart te proporciona una actitud sociable, ya que, interactuas con personal de todos los departamentos. su visión consiste en ser una empresa líder en alimentos frescos y calidad al igual que contar con personal amable y capacitado."
good,"Listens to their employees."
good,"Great working environment! I love working in a place where co-workers actually WANT to do their job and continue to do it better. Shifts can be short and inconvenient, and some days will have very low hours such as five."
good,WalMart is a fast-paced work place where daily asks and roles are constantly changing. It is important to adapt and learn quickly because you can fall behind very quickly if you do not.
good,Cashiers are part time. Many  positions available. Every position is a different pay. An hour lunch.two 15 minute breaks if you have a shift that is less than 6 hours it's only one break and no lunch
good,"Overall I had a great time working for Walmart. Benefits were not that bad at all. You could get health, dental, vision, life, and even 401 k. Getting in with Walmart Stock was a good idea too. I was a sales floor associate. Which means that I ran a register, stocked freight, completed modular, and helped customers find merchandise. Most of the time the job was very enjoyable. I got along with almost all the employees in the store. Management collaborated pretty well. Most were professional and actually listened to what you had to say. Store Manager ran the store quite well. Summer time and Christmas were the big times for the store. There were many days that required you to move pallets and pallets of heavy merchandise so by the end of the day you would be completely exhausted. The store was 24 hours so, depending on what your job title was would determine what hours you worked. I could work anytime between 7am and 11pm. There would be multiple times where you would go over your hours. Sometimes overtime would be approved and sometimes it wouldn't be. When it came to customers, you would have quite a few that were very well mannered. And then, of course, you would have those that would treat you like absolute dirt no matter what and showed you zero respect."
good,"Wal-Mart for me was a good work place , had great co workers and some customers were really nice . I had 1 hours lunch most days which were great. I would recommend some else at walmart."
good,"Excelente local de trabalho, equipe comprometida e que se relacionava bem."
good,"Good and reliable. Some of the managers a tough to get along with at first but if you are friendly and can get along with others, they'll be no problem."
good,"Each day was different due to what product came in and what the customer flow. I worked a a few great stores in which the management team was supportive yet strict. The most frustrating part of the job is the customers, but without them the job wouldn't be there."
good,"It was a welcoming and engaging place to work with solid pay and hours, however management and the other departments felt like they were disconnected and communication seemed poor."
good,"Working in retail during the holiday season, is not the easiest of things. Dealing with customers arguing about price matching, wanting to know when the next shipment of hot toys will be in and having a fist fight break out because of misunderstandings. The hardest part for me was standing for eight hours a day five days a week. The managers and supervisors were all wonderful. I miss them."
good,"learned a great deal from coworkers. training was largely computer-based, but staff was very helpful as well. management played favorites (a major drawback). very focused on numbers and output."
good,got lots of experience and made lots of friends at walmart. very fast paced and a lot of manual labor. very fast paced and hands on. you have to remember a lot of things in a short amount of time
good,".Good Training of job to be performed."
good,"I love working at my Walmart store and I have a deep relationship with almost everyone I know. A typical day is very busy for my job title but I love staying busy and active. There is always something to do and new to learn. I have learned so much over my years as a supervisor about the depths of running a business and working with a variety of people, learning strengths and weaknesses and finding a balance to get the achievement that is best for the associates and the business. The culture is very diverse but in our store, everyone works together as a team to get the job done and help teach others and new associates. The hardest part of my day is mostly dealing with vendors to get them to work with the store to deliver the results for a business we need OR finding a balance of the work load if we have a lot of associate call outs due to weather or illnesses. The most enjoyable part of my job is staying busy and working with a lot of great people, we are always sharing a good laugh while we work and helping the customers!"
good,"Overall the job was typical from day to day work shifting as demand changed, I learned a lot about managing my own stress and motivating others, as well as how to keep myself busy. The workplace was rather laid back and okay but there were managers that they only seemed to be interested in making my life stressed. The hardest part of the job was more how to appease my store managers and the easiest part of the job was making sure that i did my responsibilities and accomplished what I set out to do."
good,"get there 15 min early talk with others, clock in wait for super to show up from office meeting. Be on time, or else, but wait  to start work. Workplace was easy going, in warehouse. They used warehouse workers, to assist the cashiers when needed."
good,The company is a great place to work but you do have to  overcome the pettiness there . The associates are okay for the most part. The managers are sometimes hard to deal with.
good,Working at Walmart was a great learning experience for me considering it was my first job. I learned lots of valuable skills i will carry into any future work.
good,"Fast pace work with patience and interest. Never lose your heart. cooperate with your manager to achieve the objective as all of us working for the best interest of the company. workplace culture is  in your hand as I always ready to help each and every person.So every body feel a sigh of relief in my presence."
good,It’s better to work there if you are providing for just you if you have a family I herd from coworkers it gets kinda tight but the management is alright and the people you’ll work with on the sales floor are all friendly and as for customers you never know what you might get
good,"The average work day consisted of pushing carts, cleaning the lot and the entrances, as well as making sure lot was prepared for weather if necessary."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart as a baker is stressful but doable. Very fast pace. Hard labor for the woman, as in carry 50 lb of frozen dough to your work station."
good,"Walmart all in all is busy work, and you will have no problem finding something to do.  Generally speaking management is good, but could potentially be problematic.  Family like associates with all kinds of different personalities.  Of course since it's an entry level job-expect the standard entry level of coworkers, some okay, some can be bad.  But Walmart as a collective is pretty awesome for the retail industry, and gives solid benefits for those who want to make a career of the company."
good,Walmart has always been ahead of the curve among its industry.  The advancements in technology are helping it grow.  The micro is not as smooth as the macro.
good,"Working in Emergency Management was very rewarding, we were able to assist our Associates as well as the public. Global investigation I enjoy working with teams to research data for their case."
good,amplio conocimiento y crecimiento personal y profesional
good,"My store was an alright place. Can get stressful with the amount of freight to stock especially during the holidays but stocking was what I got paid to do, so there was no need to complain about that. Never a dull moment, always something to do. Had fun with the staff and some of the management."
good,"I've been with the company for 3 years. Hired on as full time and found the benefits package to be fantastic with options for customization. They have recently even included options for part-timers to get benefits! The staff discount card is a fantastic addition allowing you 10% off everything, which adds up buying groceries!"
good,The pay is good the job is easy and love the people I work with. My only complaint is the poor management and dealing with some customers. The managers are always throwing each other under the bus which makes it really hard to do your job and please all the managers. They barley communicate with each other and take it out on the employees. Other than that the pay is great as well as your co-workers
good,Management is key here. If you have poor managers work is not very fun and you can be written up for little to no reason just to cover your managers back. There are some benefits. If you work hard there is plenty of room for advancement.
good,"Maintenance worker,I cleaned entire store including restrooms,walls. The hardest part of work for the company was changing the schedule without informing us."
good,You need to learn how to be efficient in everything that you do there. If you do not you will fall behind and you will not be successful in your daily duties.
good,"Trabajé 17 años en la empresa"
good,Walmart is very diverse and good environment. Think they would get a better group of people if they paid there employees more .Excellent stock options.
good,"The distribution center was very fast paced, and throughout my 15 years there my peers became some of my very best friends,"
good,the people i worked with were cool i did not like how you had to work on holidays and did not get holiday pay you got more p.t.o over all but its looked down on if you used it .
good,i loved working for Walmart because the pay and benefits were good. i didn't like the management because they were unprofessional. to me it felt like they were more concerned with getting people fired and rehiring.
good,"No day is the same even though the seasons repeat year after year. There is a large change with weather, holidays and even just freight flow as it comes in to what needs to be completed. I get to spend a lot of time teaching and training associates and discussing department performance with them. I really enjoy this as they grow into better leaders and planners."
good,"I only intended to work full-time over the summer, but continued to work part-time for my fall semester while I was at school. I found that my managers there were really nice and appreciated the work I did, so I didn't want to leave. The shifts were 2-11pm, which weren't ideal, but that was really my only complaint about the job itself and that can't be changed since it is based on the times the trucks would arrive. My complaint about the store is that the backroom is entirely too small for that size of a Walmart and was never upgraded when the store was enlarged. This made our job much more difficult and I felt like it put a lot more stress on management, especially during the holiday season."
good,"A empresa e naavilhosa"
good,"Ahí no estuve muy cómodo ya que mis superiores (cercanos) tenian diferencias sexuales pero mi inconformidad obvio no es eso, es el trato que presentaban aveces los supervisores"
good,It’s a nice place to work and sometimes you may have to lift heavy equipment. A person will have good benefits and great pay. They may feed you at times near holidays or no accidents in a certain amount of days.
good,Es una empresa buena para el aprendizaje en servicio al cliente
good,"A typical day would  be, me, team leader to make sure my guys were on task for the day and doing what we were supposed to be doing. There was always something to do if it wasn't getting pallets off of the truck it was cleaning up our station and then stalking the store."
good,Buena empresa para realizar carrera pero en santiago que es donde se encuentra el área Comercial. En los locales de regiones existe un piso y no se puede avanzar a no ser de emigrar a Santiago.
good,Had good managers but had way to many bad managers. Basically you have a whole bunch of chiefs trying to manage when they are still regular Indians. If they had bettwr team work it would be the best job in the world
good,Though the truck was hot and very dangerous it was also so satisfying to finally put that last box on the line. Especially for big trucks. I only left for the simple fact of no health benefits.
good,Me gusta mucho sus reglas de la empresa ya que con eso tenemos mucha seguridad laboral
good,It's a really fast-paced job. You also may have to stand on your feet for awhile. It gets to be fun because as you work there you get a lot faster at what you are doing. Managment is was good. The only thing bad thing is is that you only have 4 sick days or else yo9u are fired.
good,"I enjoyed working the job and the environment but i did not get a long with what i thought was lazy management, the reason i ended up leaving was because the manager basically acted as a “road crew manager” where they would barely do anything or barely help and stack work on already swamped workers"
good,Alright place to start out at if you're young in high school or starting collage or if your kids are in high school. Work a lot of weekends and holidays.
good,Good  company to work for. I gained a lot of experience with working with others. I learned how to stack boxes nice neatly in the trailers. I learned how the company functions.
good,"The hours was very long,The management was not really that great definitely in need of training. There was room for growth and you had some really good benefits."
good,"Working for Walmart was rewarding in the sense that you were part of a team accomplishing a larger goal. We were generally stretched thin and overworked, but it felt good to sit back and know that we did a good job, and our supervisor made sure to let us know our performance was great."
good,"Open-minded environment, with an appreciation for individual strengths. Managerial ways lead to self improvement. The company policies aim to a good performance and reward the compliance towards the BEST way"
good,"It was easy to get along with everyone for me, a lot of people argued with management. I’d say some management does treat you poorly but some would apologize for and and thank you for being understanding. I never had an issue until the last month I worked there."
good,"So many opportunities, working for a great manager and being empowered to do something was a career forging experience."
good,Crosby Wal-Mart night shift is dangerous have no security and sane people comes in 2-3 day a week shoplifting and management turns their head but expect the associat to stop the shoplifter and put their life in danger
good,During the end of the year last year and beginning of this year hours were cut.  There wasn't enough help to run the dairy properly.  That would mean I was staying over my shift to make sure things where done even though there wasn't supposed to be any overtime.  Which in turn I lost time with my kids.  I don't like that.
good,Front end manager is horrible and talks about her associates to other associates. They show favoritism . The Co-Managers are great. But the department managers need work.
good,"Good place to learn "
good,A empresa só teria que fornecer mais treinamentos.
good,my day usually was good but tired I loved my customers and I know most of them felt the same.I worked hard was fast friendly and my co workers enjoyed me especially all my CSMS each booss was great I would still be there if I had not tried the bakery and could be cashier again any CSM would like to have me back. All and all good pay room for advancement. but you should be able to try something first if you dont like it door should be open to go back. The hardst part is working different shifts and late nights. The bst part is meting people and helping them.
good,The team was very efficient and made sure duties were carried out effectively.  I learned to develop myself more as a people person due to customer interaction.
good,Loved working for Walmart there was lots that you can learn and the limits are endless. Working for Walmart can teach you a lot. There are tons of opportunities.
good,"I cant actually give too much detail because I'm still currently employed by Walmart but for the most part it can be a reasonably good place to work, but Walmart doesn't hire anyone on full-time unless the position demands it which unless its a management position of any level or if the job code allows it. From my experience the company is for the most part fair and usually works with you on your availability if they can and they focus on building up their associates who show interest or potential. If you don't want to advance and just kinda wanna be there and you work but you are just there get a paycheck you can but not usually where you would like to work. Most of the departments in the Super Centers require you to be engaged with the customers and fellow associates, and you are constantly stocking and zoning(organizing the merchandise towards the front of the shelf), this allows the customer easy access and keeps the departments in neat and clean form. The hardest part of the job is the semi-constant change in procedures and sometimes policies, which Walmart does to improve the company as a whole which in my opinion(and many others) isn't always the case."
good,"A typical day at work involved zoning, go backs, filling out claims, and great customer service. I learned how to answer phone calls and help a customer through the other end of the line, read UPC numbers, and take care of hazards when I encounter them. My job duties involved being assigned a task and getting it done by the end shift.The hardest part of my job was not having the appropriate equipment to locate merchandises home. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with others."
good,While it is stressful it prepares you for several other industries with in class and on the job training. Lots of tools physical and electronic to track metrics and positively impact store performance.
good,They legit feel like they need to dumb themselves to talk to you which is all around disrespectful. So that's the only negative thing that I can say about Walmart. In fact its the only thing I can say about Walmart.
good,"Walmart has come a long way when it comes to taking care of their associates. The pay, benefits and treatment of employed has improved greatly over the past years."
good,"It is a fun job to work at, but management needs a bit of work in the front. Too much is expected from one person in self checkout area. They expect one person to do multiple things at once."
good,"Good place to work "
good,it was busy and half the time you didnt have enough people to work and that ment you had to do your job and other pepoles.. and some time managmemt would help but not often
good,Trabajar en equipo y buscar los mejores resultados diariamente
good,"Walmart didn't pay well, but it did offer small rewards for the people who worked well.  For example, I was part time but would often receive 30 or more hours.  They offer to move you up if you work well."
good,Easy job just lack of hours and pay. No set schedule  but easy to get hours. Friendly co-workers and management. Would recommend as a first job for a teenager
good,"Easy paced. I worked 3rd shift, but prefer not to work that shift. Learned how to be a cashier. Management was helpful and polite. Team mates were fun to work with. Dealing with grouchy people was a not so fun experience, especially when you do your best to be polite to them. Getting to know people was great."
good,"I did not mind working hard. I just wanted there to be a little less of a demand on my time, and to be able to finish one task before another one was handed to me. It was a great place to work, but being a department manager for Walmart is tough. I'm not sure I was cut out for that position, and the demands that were placed upon me."
good,"I would work overnight at my local walmart. I have had fun at this job, but the management was getting stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people from different cultures."
good,The company is good overall it have plenty opportunity to advancing. I worked there for a while an enjoyed communicating with the customers and it made my day helping others
good,"Quality of management strongly varies from store to store, surprising level of quality expected, kept busy through the work day, promotions are common and encouraged."
good,"Walmart is a productive ,slow paced, and friendly environment which provides great benefits and hire some great people. Walmart teaches you the perfect customer service skills and a great open door policy to speak on anything or to even request for a change of job description."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart for the first 15 years.  After that it was not as good.  I would recommend the place to work, however, I would say to work part time.  The trouble is, now they do not offer benefits with part time.  Over all It was a good job that worked for me as long as I was there."
good,"The job is fast paced and you do meet  friendly people both employees and customers that come to shop. The first day is the hardest because you try to learn everything at the same time. Once you do get the hang of it, it is smooth sailing from there."
good,"es una empresa noble con sus asociados, permite crecer y cree en la capacidad de cada uno, si tienes alguna necesidad buscan el modo de que tengas solución, empresa comprometida con la convivencia familiar."
good,"Walmart has given me many opportunities to use throughout any work environment. It has taught me how to be responsible, and to manage my time wisely in an orderly manner."
good,This job has a production  mind-set that helps you get in do your work fast pace and safe then get off work. This job also have nerve recking cons as far as certain decision  making from management team that at times doesn't make sense for the productive work environment which at times distance  some associates from the production mind-set which hurts the entire build working as a unit.
good,J'ai eu une excellente expérience avec la flexibilité des horaires.
good,If you work well with people and have great punctuality then this is a great job for you. It is a fast paced job... at least in the area I worked which was the deli.
good,"Lo que mas me gusto fue la enseñanza que me dejaron tal como el uso de maquinarias, y la experiencia laboral en una empresa tan grande como es la misma."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people from different walks of life. All working towards the goal of getting all of the freight out that we could on each given night. If we got our area done we were assigned to another department to help out our fellow employees.  You could ask your shift supervisor or assistant manager and they would assist in whatever way they could.
good,Quarterly bonus for associates. Celebrations for all associates at each quarter. For most part staff is highly committed and long tenured. Company continue to change to meet profitable goals.
good,Management was terrible. But the hours were not given deserved. But making friends with everyone was generally easy. The hardest part is the customers. But the fun part about working with Walmart is working with our friends. It never is a dull moment.
good,The hours are fair and shifts have break opportunities. A more or less freedom of pace is applicable. Offers good job security and benefits such as discounts. Opportunities to transfer departments are offered every 6 months so you can change if you don't like your current position.
good,A typical day at work will start off as I CVP items that expire on that day. After that I would open the deli and start helping customers. I learned a lot working at Walmart. you have to stay on top of everything and be quick. the hardest part of working in the deli is not having the proper help. the most enjoyable part is being apart of a big company like that its like having another family.
good,"my store closed,so i lost my job we had costumers that could be challenging at times.at times i found it challenging because of my strong work ethnic,and co workers were more relaxed and slower"
good,They generally hire anyone. The only thing they ask is show up on time and show up for work. That was the main issue they had. The job was hard and fast paced but overall worth it.
good,"if you go in a do what you are suppose to do you usually will not have any problems, If you are reliable and show up for work then they will usually hire you in fulltime"
good,"Empresa multinacional no ramo do varejo, todos os anos ao realizar o balanço se a loja alcançasse as metas todos os funcionários recebiam bonificação."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of, clocking in going to your department and assisting customers, mixing paint and stocking shelves i learned basic customer service skills my department and zoning managers were amazing the assistant manager over the area was remarkable and who was great and able to lead and command respect, the workplace culture revolved around assisting the customers with best possible care the hardest part of that job is during my tennure there there was no opportunity to switch from fulltime from part time the most enjoyable part was my team they helped me through the toughest times and we were all fun loving and friendly"
good,"My job as a cashier at Wal-Mart was not too terrible. One of the most valuable skills I learned was how to deal with a lot of different people with different background and cultures. Can be stressful when you get a difficult and needy customer, but a lot were very nice and regulars."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, unfortunately I was trying to hold down 2 jobs at the time and just couldn't keep up with both. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and most of the mananmgement."
good,"busy, stayed busy, hard to put up with some people but just smiled and wish them a good day. people was nice to work with. management changed a lot. but over all ok"
good,"In the changing world, Walmart is losing its self identity.  In an ever increasing effort to be like everyone else... beat Target, Aldi, Amazon, Walmart is losing the theme that helped propel it to the top.  Simple pricing, helpful and happy associates and its own home-grown style."
good,Learned how to operate a kitchen slash deli environment.full of different meats and cheeses and deli hots foods that I all learned which is which and how to make
good,I would like to give good service to each customer but am under pressure to move people through my line quickly. We are supposed to be attentive and friendly but that can be challenging when we are under pressure to move our line.
good,Working at Walmart was just a way for me to earn money to pay for school. I would recommend working there for that reason. Another reason to work at Walmart is if you like working with people and performing customer service.
good,It is a great company to work for but the management team doesn't always work with you to support you on your duties as a department manager. They are very understanding and flexible with hours.
good,"Upon relocating to the Distribution Center within a few months I found out I had cancer.  I did work during my treatment but I feel that management did not support me during this time.  I feel like more work was put on me and I was set up to fail.  "
good,"Walmart is a great place to work and get good time experience with customer service. The only con the I can think of when working here is when there is a busy day, it drains you a little more. Other than that its a great place to work."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to belong to with much room for career advancement. Wal-Mart is very corporate in nature meaning that everything  from the rules, regulations, and expectations are very detailed and laid out. There's an open door policy at every level of management. if youone shoujld past the ninety day review there's many perks that the company offeres."
good,aqui el trabajo era bajo presión  todo estaba muy bien lo único con lo que no estaba de acuerdo era que  no me respetaban mi hora de comida  y tenias que quedarme muchas veces a doblar turnos por errores de otras personas
good,"Interacción con el cliente, descanso entre semana, promociones etc"
good,Only left due to a reduction of work force.  Would go back in the future.  As long as you are able to adapt to change you would be a great fit.  Management doesn't always follow the guidelines set forth by corporate.
good,I like working at Wal-mart enjoy being there but need to find something better for myself. Working there has given me the skills that I'm ready to take with me to another job that can elevate me to my next level
good,"My direct supervisor or Asset protection manager was awesome. but the actual store manager was completely oblivious to what went on with the security side of the things. After a while it felt like it was the security associates working against the rest of the store. But I also know for a fact that most other stores are not like that at all, and that our store manager is the exception not the rule."
good,"a pretty decent place to work, but it can get hectic at times. one great thing about it is that you get to meet and interact with a lot of different people from all over the world."
good,"At Walmart I learned a lot about teamwork, and multitasking. Not everybody is free at the time of your need so you need to be able to accommodate accordingly. Everyone was very nice, but some were very demanding, not that it was too much to handle."
good,walmart a very challenging job can be tough at times but also a place her friendships are made also gureenteed job title lots of standing on your feet have to be mentally built
good,Wal-Mart is a safe and friendly corporation to work for. There are many pros about working for such a huge company as well as cons. I enjoyed my time working for then and I am ready for a change as well as a new start.
good,"I was hired as a Greeter then moved gradually into stockroom duties after the Holiday rush, required to assist Associates and Customer Service personnel in restocking myriad merchandise."
good,Walmart is an interesting company. Over Night's were great. Management was blended when it came to organization. Unfortunately when going threw computer based learning (CBL) when I finish then it took then over a month to pass me so I could get my well deserved raise.
good,"I worked as a people greeter when i was 18-19 years old. On most days, all i had to do was greet customers and check their receipts. though on other days, i was asked to do other tasks including: pushing carts, gathering trash outside, getting more plastic bags for registers, pushing stocks onto the sales floor, and taking back returns. in short, taking care of any quick and helpful task that needed taken care of."
good,"A fast paced productive work place. "
good,"Walmart has gone through a lot of changes so it has become a task based jobs.  Instead of working in one area, one would do the tasks needed for the entire store as needed."
good,Walmart was a really cool experience I loved working there I loved the team the pay the everything we had a few things to work out but we got there and we got things accomplished together as the Walmart family
good,Walmart is a good place to work but the money is not much especially for the ones that work hard but you do a job because you like it not because of what you get paid
good,I enjoyed the work at walmart and the only reason that I chose to leave was due to personal trouble that was in no way related to the work environment.
good,"it was an okay company to work for, the management at my specific store seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. however, the over all job was good for the pay it gave, I would work there again."
good,"Typical work day was sorting break packs and the stocking shelves, covering the cash register and checking out customers and doing zoning. I learned how to read shelf labels in order to stock shelves and I learned how to do customer service. Management was stuck up and was not very nice and tended to ignore you for the most part. The culture was nice though, Being able to see different types of people come in and see the different things each culture bought was pretty interesting. The hardest part of the job was break pack...sorting pallet after pallet of boxed product was sometimes an endless procedure.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Working ith the public and with the people I worked with there was the grearest."
good,Walmart was a fun place to work for. I worked a closing shift at the Vision Center for years. Was treated well but did not feel that I would advance in the company.
good,"I loved working as an overnight stocker, it was rwlaxed and we worked at a steady pace . I only left the job because it was interfering with my brother's ability to make it to work as I was driving him."
good,"While it is very, very fast-paced, it was the most organized and smooth operating pharmacy that I've worked at. Management is well prepared to handle busy, stressful situations while maintaining customer service."
good,"If you are able to deal with customers and different personalities. You may enjoy your job. The management at the time of my employment was good. They had more hours I could pick up, if I needed extra money. I did not feel over worked or stressed. I loved the discount employees received. At the time of hire. A new employee would receive a quarter more for every year they worked at previous employment. Awesome! This was over ten years ago though, hope they still offer it!"
good,"Just like in any work place you can have your good days and then you can have your bad days."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart but did not like the fact that I did not receive the same pay as the male partners in other stores. I worked with three local stores. I had request a pay raise was declined. I knew I was an above average Associate when I broke the company record of apprehensions in one year, and Internal activity in one year. When I left the company they hired three people to cover the three stores I had been covering. I doubled my pay when I went to another company"
good,The job was a good job there is a lot of Opportunities to move up you meet some good people you get your breaks and lunches on time it was a Pleasant place to work
good,"Walmart is decent work environment that allows for flexible hours, various positions, opportunities to move up in the company, and is a great place for part-time work."
good,"Quick-paced environment, no slacking. Associates constantly fired/hired. Strict policy on calling sick. 3 is max and then you are fired by a computer system."
good,A typical day working at Walmart was unloading the truck and cleaning up around the areas that need it do a a lot of  products on shelves in the back  and the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck somewhere heavy stuff are the parish pries everybody respected each other.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, es una buena empresa para el crecimiento profesional."
good,A typical day at work would be handling customers with certain aspects...helping customers with anything they need...handling money transactions....the hardest part of the job is trying to make a customer happy that day....the enjoyable part is coming to work and making money of course but it’s really what you make it.
good,"When going out to work, so many people look at every detail of a place and if one thing is wrong, they quit. Walmart is a place of business and it will never be perfect or have perfect people. If you are expecting easy, don't apply. If you are expecting everything to go your way, don't apply. If you have a set schedule but want 40 hours, don't apply. (It's not going to happen.) Bottom line, Walmart is a good place to work. People criticize and judge but you won't find a better starter job (and sometimes a full career) elsewhere especially with them raising their starting wage. Work hard and without complaint or don't work at all."
good,"I started out as a cashier in 2013, and by 2015, I moved up to a Customer Service Manager. The job is very fast paced and can be stressful because you are in charge of 40 plus front-end employees. While managing customer complaints, lines, and upper management request. Overall, I enjoy my job. However, we are always short staffed."
good,Great company that needs to work more on HR side at store level. Wish they had a local head office. District manager and BC head office team have no interest in development of management unless a person has networking.
good,would have like to have more hours and and better wage rase for the work you do because a new employee most often makes more money than the person who had worked for a few years.
good,My job at Walmart was was very exciting I loved helping people I loved the environment Its not much I can say but they should pay their cashiers at least $11.00 or better by it being a multimillion company the hardest part is dealing with rude customers
good,"I loved working with the customers and the over-all job experience, I had very good hours while I was employed at Wal-Mart, management was great, and loved my co-workers"
good,"The job was quick-paced at first because I helped open a store, but it calmed down eventually. There's still not much down time though as a cashier. The hardest part of the job was standing in one small area for hours. The pay was okay."
good,"The pharmacy could be confusing to some at times, very mind consuming which kept you busy. i enjoyed working with the team we had, we worked well as a team. I loved the steady pace which made working not seem as bad on the long days. My last Pharmacy Manager was very nice and patient when it come to teaching new associates their responsabilities. I liked working in the pharmacy because it is a somewhat repetitive position to have but new challenges occurring daily from cutomes, isurance companies to doctors offices keep the job intresting. I enjoy speaking with and assisting customers by answering their questions to helping them locate things over the counter or simply having a conversation. I enjoy knowing that I am helping others even if it is something as simple as a conversation."
good,You can advance quickly as long as you are willing to give up personal time.  I had zero experience in retail and moved into department management in 4 mos and salary mgs in 4 years.
good,It was good work place for working as a relaxing and with good environment. Also manager & co manager as well as asst manager with supervisor are good cooperative nature prrsons. Also there was good training program for job & safety.
good,"It was a random workday."
good,It is fine to work but you're told that when you're new you won't get many hours. As long as you stick it out you will get the hours. Of course cashiers are losing hours because of the self-check but that's how things go.
good,ótima equipe de colegas trabalho com um bom horario
good,It's a fine job that you can work.  Love some of the coworkers I work with some workers were not good but not everyone is.  But yes the store I work in I would say some mangers there need to be relocated or let go.
good,"Very customer driven work. Good learning job and multiple opportunities for advancement if available to you. Good place to work if you want to learn many different types of work such as cashier, electronics, automotive, health, crafts, food, hardware, sports and more."
good,Walmart's cultural is very open and friendly. The workers are friendly and are willing to help you when you need it. On the worst days the workers helps you make the day better.
good,hard place to move up but a really good place to work for few months or a year or two while you go to school or save up. the people who work there make the experience better because they are all so nice and it makes it seem like you are always with friends.
good,Uma boa empresa para se começar a trabalhar ou para fase final de sua vida de trabalhador.
good,It's a nice place to work.  We have a lunch room. There are pop and snack dispensers which you pay for. There is a subway in the store.  You can also get hot food inside the store.  You have to pay for it.
good,Face paced and competitive. The company has room for you to grow if you desire. Plenty of opportunities to expand job capabilities in a variety of settings.
good,"I enjoyed learning the assemblance of a brand new store from the ground up and wouldnt trade that experience for anything.  New people getting together at ground level to the completion and pride in a job well done on opening day was wonderful, The desire and good work ethics made the job go quickly as setup was completed."
good,The best place to work? Great people to work with and a lot of fun to be around. Company have a lot of opportunities for the people who love to work hard and take care of the customers.
good,"Walmart was a good work place, there were great co workers the management was great, it offers good benifets .day and night jobs were exciting and fast paced"
good,"Management could have been more involved with the associates directly underneath them. There were plenty of advancement opportunities, almost one or two per month in some cases."
good,"Wal-Mart is a very lively place. If you are looking for something that can be fast-paced, it delivers. That said, sometimes it can get overwhelming due to issues concerning staffing. Management can only do so much, especially with such a large store to oversee. The workplace culture can be fine when it comes to things like benefits, holiday's, and the like but the hardest part of the job is the aforementioned lack of staffing, leaving a person with more on their plate than necessary. You should also have a plan to move up in the company eventually or move out."
good,The Inventory Control job is very fast paced. I learned how to operate a forklift as well as train associates. I was fortunate to work with a good manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a variety of people.
good,Foi otimo o aprendizado q tive na empresa nao tenho muito o q dizer
good,Fast pace improving process so not so much is on overnight crew. Great pay and benefits even for part-timers. My managers were very hands on didn't just walk around watching.
good,lo que mas me a gustado de trabajar en esta empresa es la experiencia que puedes tomar de todas las areas y personas con las que convives.
good,It was an interesting placfe to work at meeting new people was great also. the thing that stands out the most is the different stories you hear by jus having small talk and interacting with the customers.
good,I feel like Walmart is very disorganized and they should communicate better. I also feel like it’s a lot of unfairness and all about making money and using whoever you have to to get what they need.
good,Muita oportunidade de crescimento.  Fornece alimentação no local. Portas abertas para falar com chefias.
good,"I was an overnight stocker, so it was pretty quiet when I was there. I stocked the shelves at my pace and they left me alone. The discount you get to shop there is pretty good to. Definitely worth it!"
good,Not a bad place to start working but u don’t want to get caught up up there . Eventually I would want to leave and find something else to do. But yeah not that bad to start
good,"I loved the people I worked with. I really did, but the managers were so verbally abusive the most laid back person would eventually snap. But other than that its easy work all be it fast paced, But Its a nice way to meet new people."
good,"mind you this was in 1996, the management team was great and family oriented.  We had fun with our jobs while giving our customers great customer service.  I went from being a cashier to being department manager, and was also lead in the layaway department.  It used to be a great place to work.  Now I see the employees don't stay around very long."
good,"Lugar bom de se trabalhar, pessoas simpáticas"
good,"its a good job if your just coming into the job market. The training is good also (only at select locations) all though it takes awhile to move up, its a overall good first job"
good,"My time spent at Wal-Mart was pretty fun. The deli could be very difficult at time, but it was the co-workers that made it all better. The hardest part of our day was cooking and helping customers at the same time."
good,Muito boa de trabalhar. Todos os processos mapeados e os setores bem divididos.
good,"Stocked shelves, had to do inventory on products, using correct transactions for helping customers, and giving the excellent customer experience. The only thing I did not like was the drive in a new state."
good,"The store had a wonderful management team in the beginning. Once management changed, associate morale went down the drain and many people lost interest in the company. Managers had a ""hit-list"" of associates they did not like and therefore looked through a microscope to find reasons for dismissal."
good,"This job kept us very busy changing mods all the time, scanning and fulfilling merchandise constantly and not much customer service.  Learned how to manage employees schedules to optimum production."
good,"Working for Walmart for nearly a year, I saw many different things. There were a large amount of people who enjoyed their work and the people with whom they worked, and then there were those who were actively trying to make it unbearable to be there. The store manager seemed to be a genuine person, but all of managers (assistants included) were relatively new. Only one associate in the back was licensed to use power equipment, and was not there every day. The place was great to be in and I would go back in an instant. However, even with passing supervisory tests and continually proving my capability to perform the tasks of a supervisor or a lead elsewhere in the building, there were never any interviews for the positions to my knowledge (several positions for a significant pay increase were open for several months without being filled). I forced my attendance points to go over the limit to see if it would prompt action in either a positive or negative way, and then negatively I got a response."
good,"I found the store you work at highly effects you workplace experience. One location can have a very different approach to management and employee relations than another location, which can either uplift and encourage employees, or drive them away.  Stores that have structure and can also work with and encourage associates seem to have the best work environments."
good,"I've learned a lot during my time as a pharmacy technician. People are crazy and very demanding at times, and it can be very stressful. The best part of working at the pharmacy is learning all about medicine and having that knowledge at hand outside of work."
good,loved being a cashier love working around people and meeting new people. nothing was hard when checking people out. later went to bakery and made donuts and packing them and put out on sale floor. nothing hard making donuts everyday.
good,"Walmart benefits, 401 k is much bigger than the other company I work. It is stressful when I moved from the other state, that's the reason why i file my resignation coz the manager didn't hear to my flee to change me from other department. I was always a closer in produce area I live 30 miles away from my work I just commute in Bus. I work in produce department. Im only 5 ft tall, a female,I have a hard time stocking the bananas and other fruits, I complained about this cause my shoulders and back hurt so I file my resignation."
good,Es una empresa con un personal sano y con valores en la cual permanecí durante 7 años y decidí salirme para tener más oportunidad de crecimiento económico y de aprendizaje
good,i did several things at this job from helping customers to stock taking and hauling stock from wearhouse to the floor and different dept in the store. would alot of times had to help coworkers in other dept.
good,"great place to work, culturally high and great and understanding management teams ever. good associates and safe environment. learn how to communicate with customers and have a broad knowledge about life in America.the most enoyable part was sharing ideas."
good,If you want a job where you're always doing something then Walmart is the place for you. You will have to Unload both GM side and grocery side then stock the grocery.
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading a truck, moving freight, stocking freight and cleaning. Management tried their best. Good work environment, nice break room, friendly co-workers. Hardest part was getting your aisle done with the time they gave you. most enjoyable was talking with each other and helping out customers and chatting with them and what they have planned for the day and how their day is going. I did learn how to use a electric pallet jack, how to make a bale, knowing how to use a MC-40 and a TC-70, and what everything ,means on a label."
good,Very fast paced.  Very customer service oriented. I learned product management back room inventory management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers in all kinds of circumstances.  The most enjoyable was the people I had the pleasure of working with.
good,"A typical day I would provide excellent customer service,help customers, cleaning belt area."
good,"As a customer service supervisor, it was difficult finding the help we needed when our checkout lines were getting too long. It was very fast paced and challenging, but overall I enjoyed the challenges it presented me."
good,nice place to work but hours are long and very fast paced environment to work management is very nice and will work with you to see that you succeed at your position
good,good place to work and it's laid back. chance to meet different people .i shop there all tha time and I never had a bad experience wit employees or customers. I got along with management also.
good,A typical work day will start off busy but then when 6:00 pm hit it would just go very slow for the rest of the night 
good,The people there are fun and friendly to work with. They would always explain something to you if you didn't understand it or show you how to do something.
good,"Always enjoyed making conversation with the customers as they came through.  Always addressed any issues they had while they were in the store.  Management in front of store was awesome, always fair and accommidating, co-workers were diverse and I enjoyed all of them."
good,"Place associates in the assigned areas to ensure the store gets zoned, have to assume the role of assistant managers. Also have to verify the overstock freight after cap2 stock the shelves."
good,"A typical day at work involved logging into several systems, analysis of the day and what it will be like as everyday is entirely different than the day before. Culture was laid back with respectful overtones."
good,Really enjoyed the teams I worked on.  Everyone was great!  I have made a lot of work friends in my career time at walmart.  One of my favorite part about working at walmart is how everyone is like family.
good,"cashier, greeting customers, no hard part in this job most enjoyable part is meeting all kind of people from different nationality the managers were nice but we at a lot of turnovers  with managers"
good,"On the job training was easy to follow by what fellow associates told me. Asking an assistant managers for help in what to do with certain work related items, questions, etc. seemed to be a hassle or told to ask someone else."
good,"Oferecem treinamentos para crescimento em sua área , com oportunidades de crescimento em diversas áreas."
good,a typical part of my day was to load up trailers with freight. and send them on their way. i learned how to move faster at my job and get things done faster. Also i leaned how to work better with others. the management was very skilled at their job and they always did their best to keep everyone and everything in line.
good,A lot of the job involves repeating the same thing over and over. Not a lot of room for growth but would work there again. Better management and great culture.
good,"The usual day for a cashier: In training they won't leave you until you feel comfortable (unless they have to) :) I enjoy people, so being a cashier you'd definitely get to converse as much as you'd like as long as you keep working. Hardest part was being on your feet so long."
good,This company enables you to advance your career and education. Very proud of my store. We receive compliments daily for the atmosphere we create. Overall great place to work.
good,What does a stalker in the cold food section was a great job they just cut my hours when they bad and it was across town for me to drive but love the job just kind of your own boss just do your job and get it done
good,"A typical night at work (working graveyard) one would stock over 7 hours of freight by lunch (After four hours of work) or otherwise would be reprimanded. Management was tough as nails, but would listen. The hardest part of the job would be juggling a timed grace period to get your work done and helping customers at the same time. The best part of the job is getting to know people. Not only your fellow associates but also the customers that would come in."
good,"Great job as far as hours and pay. You get a chance to move up in the company and the company works with you on your hours. I work is not hard, but you must be able to work fast due to the customers."
good,"a fast pace, customer service oriented and job secure work environment. learnthe in and outs of working a retail job, the hardest part was sink or swim style of learning and training that no guides or tests can assit or answer. the best part of the job (if you are full time) is the full package benefits 401k ect."
good,An overall fun place to work.  Low hours and low pay keep it less than desirable to work for.  Easy tasks and management is for the most part good. The coworkers are cool to work with.
good,"Get lots of skills there, good coworkers, learning how to deal with unsatisfied customers. You should always be busy and have things to do. I learned a lot there, and I will take this experience and training with me where ever I go. I am thankful for the experience, even though I was a temp hire."
good,"This is a good job for people with little to no work experience and they train you for a variety of situations and their solutions. I learned a lot about the company guidelines, state regulations for EBT and WIC."
good,And a lot of Walmart take a ride to Salary and benefits and the Maryland department has been in there only take a few minutes to get there are many different types of people who have a good day at work who have been in the Maryland department of health and
good,Wal-Mart is a very cultured life experience. Wal-Mart is very good place to work if needed a life balance such as school or a second job. Job security is always great with Wal-Mart if you just speak to management. Wal-Mart has provided me with the experience I needed with face to face customer service and cash handling and there is room for advancment if you really want it.
good,fast paced  learning skills .dealing with customers can move up in the work place set mind to it college scholarships the hardest part is not able to satisyfy the customers
good,I learned a lot at Walmart as far as merchandising and customer service goes. I enjoyed most of the other employees that worked there and management for the most part was very helpful and informative. The hardest part was having to work most weekends and all holidays. No family time since most family and friends that did not work for Walmart had weekends and holidays off.
good,"I enjoy most of the people there, real down to earth. I enjoy the challenges the job brings, no two days are usually the same. One of the main complaints I have is being asked to stay past scheduled hours and later not being compensated for it. Most of the time even if pressured to stay, you're then requested to take your overtime off. I've been vocal about further training/advice on promoting to supervisory positions for a couple years, not sure why I haven't been given opportunities, although receiving great feedback on job performance from management and those I work with directly. I'm constantly seeking pointers on what I should do to help achieve goals, and on how to better myself as an employee to further advance my career, even after positive feedback. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing my team and I be successful in completing tasks and being flexible/versatile as individuals."
good,Busy off and on certain times of the day and certain days of the week. I have learned many things. The Managers are nice and friendly and you can talk to them. It is a nice place and associates are friendly. Standing. Meeting people and talking to people and making friends.
good,"Fast friendly work environment, good benefits, and pay. Seasonal overtime is good and steady. Job advancement and raises steady. A good work environment."
good,"Although it did get stressful at times (especially during the holidays), management made sure we got the breaks, and lunches we were supposed to. The CSS are very fun to be around, and made everyday working there a blast."
good,the job was good it was stressful but i got good insured and good hours some the management was OK the place was OK just not the place for me didn't wanna work in retail and i moved and had children
good,Changing pace from day to day always kept things interesting. Wasn't a bad place to work if you knew what you were working with. Plenty of room to grow
good,"Excelente , comprometida transmite segurança e subir de cargo"
good,I work at the paint counter and I zone up everything to make it look nice and also help unload the truck and I cleaned up Walmart pick up things to make it look good
good,"I was Mod Team/Stock position overnights. My Schedule was 10 PM-7 AM, Sundays through Thursdays. I loved it. Fulltime. Our store also closed at 11 pm to the public and opened at 7 am, so I never dealt with customers, if only for an hour from 10-11 pm. Management at this specific location was difficult at times, I did end up quitting, but i loved the work and my position. I would Recommend this position to anyone that's an Introvert or has anxiety issues!!!"
good,Working at Walmart had the most ups and downs at a job I ever worked. Some days management was fair on others they would hassle and rush when you were working your hardest.
good,With that being said as most other companies these opportunities are highly based on what kind of manager you end up with. There are plenty of good managers from top to bottom and there are also uneducated ones.
good,"Culture has suddenly changed...less about the people and more focus on bottom line.   Heavy on top and lean on the bottom."
good,"Walmart has so many options for growth and advancement within the organization.  If you want to be a photographer, there is a position in that field.  If you want to be in construction there is job opportunities in that area."
good,"- loud children and impatient customers"
good,"Manejo sistema storis, y herramienta telxon en p.v."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart I hope to get re-employed.  However with budget cuts the job gets harder , I like a challenge . unfortunately my body doesn't .  If I had questions my immediate supervisor explained it pretty well . I rarely had to go to the higher supervisors . I didn't get the chance to be cross trained. Though they try hard to do that."
good,Simple and decent pay. Doesn’t offer any overtime though. Management was good on the upper level but lower level management was unorganized. Would like to go back.
good,Walmart was always a busy place to work. I loved my customers and employees and being in charge.  I learned how to be in charge and how to deal with taking charge. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the cashiers and customers happy.
good,"A typical day working in frozen would be to organize freezer.After organization of the freezer would be to pull certain merchandise, and unloading trucks"
good,"Responsable, seguro de MI mismo puntual e inovador"
good,"Started  out working in Pets Department. As associates were fired or quit I started taking over their responsibilities. Was promoted to Supervisor of General Merchandise. By the time I was let go I was taking care of pets, inside garden, hardware, and automotive."
good,Muy grato ambiente eso te dan ganas de ir a trabajar
good,"Although Walmart's pay may be average to below average, the benefit package that is included is excellent and makes up for the lower hourly pay. The hardest part of the job was cleaning when customers were still shopping."
good,"Walmart is a decent job, but it's not usually the best paid if you're not high up.  The people at my store were friendly and accommodating.  They listened to my concerns and tried to help if I had a hard time with something."
good,"Walmart was a very productive job. I enjoyed being at the front end getting to communicate with customers, coworkers, and management. It was a fast paced environment. Management maybe could have used some work on their customer service and the way they communicated with the sales associates. They were pretty selfish. The hardest part of the job was to work with a very fluctuating schedule, but I managed it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and learning something new every day."
good,Very fast place.  Something different everyday.  The people are great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is when someone leaves the company.  The most enjoyable is when I get to help someone.
good,"Great hours and great scheduling. The management often condtradicts each other with seperate delegations. Bad communication and collaboration skills. Quite a bit of drama for a retail store. There isn’t too much to complain about, though. Decent place of work."
good,"Be prepared to work work work work work..... Never a boring day at Walmart. There is always something that needs to be done weather it's stocking shelves, mandating a register, or assisting a customer you will be busy your ENTIRE shift. Just remember one thing.....it's Walmart GOLDEN RULE..... C.F.F.  Clean, Fast, and Friendly."
good,"Great place to get experience and learn lots of traits such as warehousing, inventory and problem solving situations how to work as a team become a leader how to take charge"
good,"When I first started working for Wal-Mart, i enjoyed it. As time went on i adjusted to the face-paced work environment. Though I did call out once or twice a month, my managers liked me, for the most part. I could work almost anywhere in the store. I was a very flexible associate who was also willing to work overtime. Although the training provided could be better, they are very understanding when a mistake is made and address the issues. You can't learn unless you make mistakes. I enjoyed the time spent at Wal-Mart, overall. It will definitely help me."
good,Nada muito diferente de qualquer trabalho em supermercados. A equipe era bem formada e treinada.
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you have good management otherwise forget about it. Go find a job some where better.
good,une entreprise qui prend énormément soin de leurs associés! ils sont toujours présent pour répondre à nos questions et nous aider à trouver des solutions lorsqu'ils on le temps. mais les charges de travail sont très instables. une journée tu te doit de courir partout et tu est responsable d'un département au complet sans que personne ne t'aide et le lendemain vous êtes quatre sur le plancher et vous ne savez que faire. je suis quelqu'un qui aime avoir quelque chose à faire. j'aime me tenir occuper donc je trouvais difficile de rentrer travailler pendant 8 heure et attendre que le temps passe.
good,"on a typical day of work I would stock shelves and organize shelves, I learned how to use a pallet jack, management was nice and helpful, the other workers were kind, there wasn't anything too hard about the job, the most enjoyable part was stocking certain areas of the store I liked more than others."
good,Great company to work for great benefits and compensation. Work environment is great hours are ok . Excellent pto Management Team is great to work with.
good,I had mixed feelings when working at Walmart a second time. It was a little more relaxed from the first time when families or couples weren't allowed to work at the same store whereas the second time couples who were dating worked not only at the same store but the same shift. I still enjoyed my time there. One store both times
good,Most of the time very busy short staff . Most of the time only 3 check out lanes was open. Hard to take breaks offered overtime and if it wasn't a busy night sometime could go home early
good,"Working for Walmart was an interesting and enjoyable experience. A typical day is helping customers, to go above and beyond their expectations. You learn something new everyday, that is one of the many advantages to working in retail, you never stop learning. Management has its ups and downs, somebody always has to answer to somebody else. I met a lot of people, co-workers and customers that I will never forget. If you enjoy a fast paced work environment and meeting new people this is a great place to work."
good,As long as you did your job and try your hardest the managers tend to be nice and will work with your schedule. I could always pick up a shift if i needed to but i always got good hours anyways.
good,Walmart has given me the opportunity to work really hard and was able to give the results for almost 25 years.  They set high standards and expectations and my work ethic was what made me succesful.
good,"To complete a day's work is a simple and enjoyable experience. However, the managers were often unorganized and did not set up subordinates for success. Many great associates do not get the support they deserve, making it seem as though they climb the rope they intend to hang them with. An organization can only be as great as the internal contributions and without such, it becomes too reliant upon external factors. Wal-Mart stores are falling prey to the comforts of success. Unless they remember the original dream, great associates will become scarce."
good,"strong company that will be around for a long time.  I was with them for many years.  If it wasn't for a restructure and the elimination of my job, I would have finished my career with them"
good,"My most difficult thing working there was that I had years of experience as a Supervisor and some of the Supervisors there had way less training and experience in Supervision."
good,"Great Company, in 18 years with Walmart o got very good manager and very bad ones too. The advantage is that if you don't like what you doing or your boss you can move to other division, or department, or even to another country."
good,"The job can become overwhelming at times due to a huge amount of customers all wanting a specific type of pizza or item, but the pay is good and most co-workers are chill. You get tip bonus too which adds about $20-50 extra to your paycheck. 4/5"
good,Typical Day would involve stocking shelves and assisting customers. Management is a good crew with drive and motivation that feed into its associates.
good,while working with walmart normal day some time it was busy and some time normal busy i have learn good communication skill because i am working with customer which enjoy most
good,"I was in charge of unloading the trucks. Sometimes I was the one that physically unloaded the truck, and sometimes I was on of the people separating the freight by department/aisle. After that I had to stock at least department. Some of the management was really good. They taught me a lot. The best part about the job would be the atmosphere of the work place. The people I worked with were great."
good,It was fun working in nwalmart...I really enjoyed working over there but due to some family issue I quit over there..But I recommend this job to others..
good,"No real comments necessary goog or bad, but I did like the company, and the managers I worked for. The fellow associates were always good to work with"
good,"Worked for Walmart 16 years, moved up from associate to co manager.  Suddenly going through restructure and effecting associate lives.  Great associates, customer service friendly."
good,You will  learn all about customer service and what it is. You will have some good days and some bad days but at least the pay makes up for it. You have to have an adequate amount of patience.
good,"pay is good, place is kept clean. staff is awesome. you can get the hours if you want it. if you do not like standing this job is not for you. long hours lost of cleaning after hours , closing is the worst shift to do"
good,"Job definitely keeps one busy & time goes by quickly. Learning to prioritize tasks & focusing on activity at hand, some multi-tasking is required and learning to delegate as needed. Communication written & verbal is definitely key in helping things run smoothly. Customer satisfaction is the main focus & is what this company prides itself on."
good,"Walmart was my first job right out of High School. I think working in retail can teach someone so many things, that they don't normally work with or deal with on a regular day to day job. It was an amazing first job and i learned so many things and I know if i ever needed to go back i would be welcomed back with open arms."
good,"Walmart gave me a chance fresh out of a bad situation, so it'll be hard to say anything negative about them. "
good,"At this Wal Mart, the deli and bakery were horizontally across from each other so we helped each other out whenever someone needed something. The management here was lax but the manager over the deli bakery and meat department was very picky with how we did things. The hardest part of the job was assisting customers when we were cleaning up our tools. I liked the people i worked with, always had a good laugh or two during any of my shifts."
good,"A great job, as a sales associate you can work independently, and the managers are always willing to help. Its a job where there are plenty of things to do, so you wont ever be standing doing nothing."
good,"This company offers many opportunities for advancements and learning skills. The store management team are helpful and encourage their employees to advance in their careers. In terms of hardest part, always in a different department if needed, fast pacing and managing the general public. Most enjoyable is the friendly environment between co-workers and management team."
good,"Fast Past"
good,"Working at walmart was good you get to work with lots of great people. I worked in two departments at walmart. The meat and the produce,I aslo got to work with unloading the trucks."
good,"I had a good time working there, of course sometimes you’d get the occasional rude customer. And managers may take their word over yours but other than that it wasn’t a bad job. It was good pay and after 6 months I got a dollar raise. I was making more than I was doing hard labor before."
good,"Area administrativa"
good,Wal-Mart is and excellent place for a first time job seeker. Hires young and energetic students. Diverse culture. Management very difficult. Most enjoyable part of job was customer interaction.
good,"worked alongside amazing co-workers but the work was exhausting and you had to be fast-paced. Management was exceptional, scheduling was fair. The workload was mostly reasonable."
good,"A fast paced job."
good,Great Place to work - left because it was too far from home. Also retail is not my favorite thing. Standing in one spot all day and moving the same muscles is hard.
good,"This job was exteremly fast paced, and sometimes challanging. I happened to love the abillity to do multiple things at once. Help customers, stock shelve and face products, answers phones, and cashier (when called)"
good,Wal-Mart is a fun place to work and the associates are all hard working and dedicated to their services to customers it's a great enviroment. Everybody walks around with a smile on they face.
good,"I think it can be a nice place to work, but i feel as though they do not care for their employees.  The walmart company cares more about making money for themselves than providing their associates with a decent living for their families.  Minus that i love most of my co workers. i get along with all of them.  All of my managers though are very good and there is not one associate that does not work very hard their."
good,"Good place to work. Advancement opportunities. Good benefits. Various jobs and career paths. Lots of different personalities, cultures varied tasks good compensation package."
good,the hardest part was having to wake up at 5 to go in to my 6AM shifts but other than that it was a easy job with occasional stress from the customers.
good,"This was a good job. There is room for advancement, and opportunity. The pay is good, and the employees like to help each other out. It was a great job, and experience."
good,I enjoyed working here. I had to relocate is why I currently do not work here. I would recommend this company to family and friends. I know it is fast paced and that is what I liked about the job.
good,"I worked retail pharmacy for 9 years before advancing to hospital pharmacy. I miss working with the public. I miss the people and the joy in their lives when we are able to help them in anyway. I have worked in 3 different Walmart Pharmacies. The last one, unfortunately, did me in. The management at the time, had no business working in the management position. After trying to work with the higher-ups to stay in my position, the current manager just made life very difficult for me. So being the bigger person in a bad situation; I moved on to further my career. I thank the company with highest regard for giving me the opportunity to work and learn through them. It definitely has shaped me to be the person that I am today! No regrets!"
good,steady work. more relaxed. good pay. weekends we always busy. hated some of the rules they had. the price matching rule was really confusing for employees as well as customers.
good,"Working with Customers and being in a retail environment and just being able to provide customers with a better shopping experience made it a fun,and interesting work place."
good,"I loved going in to see my coworkers every day, just me and a bunch of girl friends having some fun while we completed our tasks for the day. I did end up switching to another location and I do have to say that it really depends on who you work with, also the fact that when I switched, they changed their programs and my schedule wasn't working, resulting in a very difficult time since the managers of the new location didn't communicate with me. However, I did enjoy the pay and the ability to work at my own pace. They accept everyone without any bias against race, religion, sexuality, disability, etc. which felt really great too."
good,"walmart was a really up beat , face work place. the customers was a big reason i enjoyed my job also the benefits. I would recommend working there to anyone."
good,"I have spent the last 10 years as a manager for Walmart. It is truly the associates that have made this company what it is today. It is a very stressful job that is hard not to bring home with you. At the end of the day if you can make someone smile, help your associates feel good about themselves and continue to grow the business then you know you’re a right fit for this company."
good,"Ótimo local de trabalho, crescimento pessoal e trabalho em equipe,gerência amigável."
good,"The culture in Walmart is very customer based. The best managers do not stay with Walmart long because they transfer to better companies. But the positive side of that is that if you are new, there are almost always new positions in management opening up."
good,Day to day work honestly depends on how the customers are. There may be good days but a lot of the time there are bad days and they mainly come from hostile customers.
good,i loved going to workl everyday because it didnt feel like work. always trying to put a smile on our guests face and go above and beyond to help them find what they need
good,Walmart is a great place to work but patience is a key value and sometimes can be stressful. Getting hours can be difficult but not impossible. They also work great around school schedules.
good,started as truck unloder and in three short years made it all the way to support manager.its nice when the company helps you achieve your goals.the managers I worked with were all very hands on.
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity Wal-mart provided and have learned a lot of things about myself and others. Management can be all over the board some are excellent and others not. Learned how to be a good manager, to be organized and time management. Walmart is made up of a wide variety of people which I enjoyed getting to know people from all the areas. Doing write ups and firing people is still the hardest part of the job. Meeting all the customers and helping them find what they need. Hearing their stories and becoming a part of their family."
good,"I was a part-time employee and not for very long, so I'm not sure about benefits or anything.  I liked my supervisors, they seemed to get to know their employees.  Example: I was having a stressful couple of hours trying to get people through my line quickly, dealing with rude or inconsiderate people, cleaning up messes, and trying to get the card reader or register to work.  My manager had gotten a complaint from some woman claiming I ""told her to have a nice day in a rude tone"".  My manager came to me and asked if I was doing alright today instead of getting upset with me.  She said that complaints about me weren't normal and she wanted to make sure I was feeling okay.  I really appreciated that and felt like an individual."
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be a fast working day and time flies very quickly, Walmart is very rarely slow on customers, no matter the time of day. I learned how to stay focused and keep a fast paced work enviornment going. The hardest part of the job is learning to keep up, but it can be done. The most enjoyable part is that you're always busy no matter what."
good,Very fast paced. Lot of daily stress. But enjoy working day in and day out. Always trying to find ways to make things better. Associates are very friendly and will do anything for you.
good,"Es un trabajo estable el cual tiene sus ventajas y desventajas, no es exelente pero si esta pasable"
good,I really enjoyed working there for the short time that I was there. It was very family friendly and the employees were very friendly. The only reason I left was the pay just wasn't enough to live on and the pay raises came very slow.
good,this can place can be a place to work. But it can also be a stressful place because some of the customers can be extremely rude and can say some very hurtful things.
good,competitive and challenging work environment with opportunities for career advancements. Job prepares you for any retail related job opportunities that comes your way.
good,will miss the some of the people I work with just department is to starting to take a toll on my body physically. Wish some coworkers work more in a team fashion.
good,"A typical day consisted of the same thing, which included stocking produce. Pulling in pallets of freight. cleaning up produce department via closing procedure and making sure customers are leaving satisfied."
good,It was okay just management wasn’t always together in decisions or made it really difficult to work under because you would never know who to talk to.
good,"Walmart wasn't the worst place to work, sometimes the management got a little too rough with workers, but otherwise most was confined within each group. Mostly decent, customers weren't so bad and the break times were nice. Everybody was managed by computer so it was easy."
good,Constaba de cobrar mercancía y el buen trato al cliente por lo que necesitábamos identificar dinero falso y o dañado
good,"It was a great place to work in the beginning, but the open door policy is a joke. If you went to management about anything bad that was happening to you the whole store knew within a week. If management did something to you which happened, nothing happened to them but a talking to ( verbal warning)."
good,"At Walmart I learned to be organized and productive. It was a great workplace. The management was great, the employers i worked with were all very nice aswell."
good,"The workplace environment was good, and management was easy to deal with. Most co-workers were easy to deal with. I didn't agree with there leave policy."
good,I love my job working with people & serving the customers. Walmart has taught me so much in the last 2 yrs . I have met so many coworkers that go out of their way to help you make you feel part of the team & willing to help you learn so you can advance.
good,"It was a relaxed workplace with friendly and co-operative coworkers, the work was stressful sometimes but well worth it, good environment overall. 10/10"
good,"Buena."
good,Retail job with Customer Service the most important aspect to the cooperation.  Make the customer happy no matter what can be the hardest part expecially knowing the retail customer is so not always the best.  But it gives one a great oportunity to turn a negative into a positive each and every day.   Talking with and dealing with people everyday is awesome you get to meet and interact with all types of people. This is my fun job - only part-time evenings it helps them out for an evening/closing cashier and gives me a fun thing to do in the evenings.  I
good,"Need better work, life balance. Fast paced, minimal days off.  Fun place to work when the stress level of others is low. Currently relocated, want to look for something different."
good,Gathering carts for shoppers. Relieving other team members for lunches and breaks. Stocking returned items. Providing friendly and helpful assistance to customers. Hardest part of job was pushing carts without cart pushing machine. Enjoyable part of the job was the friendly crew and relaxed environment.
good,Though it was many years ago I had a very positive experience while employed at this company . I had flexible hours that allowed me to be with my children when I needed to be.
good,"Walmart Was a great experience for me , even though it could be stressful due to the lack of team work and management . My Pay was Good and I lovey hours ."
good,"management adds stress to our supervisors, who then add stress to us but other than that. i love the work place. customers can be annoying but the employees are friendly."
good,"Job duties and  hours were extremely flexible, as long as I worked the overnight shift.  It was a good job for a self-motivated individual.  There was always something to do."
good,Management was ok. Its a lot of walking so plenty of exercise on the job. Employees  messy. Management during problems never really solved them like supposed to.
good,"Walmart was an overall pleasant place to work. While I moved from position to position, my managers were all competent and fair in dealing with me and my fellow employees. The pay was acceptable for the amount of work required and the benefits were decent. The workplace culture was friendly and very employee centered, with holidays celebrated and perks like parties and food often offered to employees. The company's attendance policy was extremely fair and forgiving. The most enjoyable part of this job was dealing with customers. Providing a service and executing it in the name of Walmart was enjoyable and many customers responded with compliments and genuine thanks. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for employment."
good,"My overall experience working for Walmart was great, management was helpful and understanding and was a great work environment, the only downside was the distance of travel and closing most days otherwise I would definitely work there again and recommend it to others."
good,"Walmart was probably one of the most fun jobs i had, i miss working there getting to do different things each night really made the time go by, and making new friends is always a plus."
good,I loved working at walmart. Managers understood certain problems and other things made life long friends along with it. Would go hack if worked with hours alot eastier seeing i have a medical condition and doctors appointments.
good,"Supervised all aspects of the shipping & receiving distribution center for a major retail center.  Schedule employees, delegate daily assignments, and enforced company regulations. Track inventories, analyze and report sales data, and coordinate merchandise shipments.  Produced successful results in a fast paced, high volume retail environment."
good,"Some stores are fantastic, and others are... a circus..."
good,"Maintain schedule, personnel for hiring and firing, maintain the sales, customer service, ability to oversee the inventory, maintain associate with personnel and job related situation."
good,"After our daily briefing where we were given our assignments we would would begin work. Sometimes we would be called off of our assignments to help in other areas."
good,Fast pace environment. Wages are not so good. If you like the company giving you random hours to work and random days off this is the place for you to work.
good,"A great place to work but a better place to work if you are offered health,dental,and vision benefits for full time associates. This is not available for part time associates. Work environment is at a slow pace but easy to catch on. Customer service is friendly and fair."
good,A typical day at Walmart is just a day were i worked my best and gave it all i got. I've learned a lot at this place. My managers checked up on me asked me if i needed anything. the job wasn't really not that hard. I enjoyed my job because it was fun.
good,I enjoy working at Wal-mart. I enjoy my coworkers they make the job fun. I enjoy interacting with the customers there and assisting them with their needs. They make the job worth it.
good,"Nesta empresa aprendi muitas coisas era muito bom trabalhar neste lugar, mais as lideranças parecem que não sabiam o devido trabalho e valor dos seus funcionários"
good,"Stocking, Planogram Literacy, Customer Interaction, "
good,There were some consistency but at other time it was unpredictable . did not know if there was going to be a complaining customer for the day or that everything will go smoothly
good,"I was busy at times, but that made the hours pass quickly.  Loved who I worked with.  Overall it was a great experience and I learned a lot.  It is a great place to work while getting through school."
good,entry level job- they trained new guys on changing oil and tires on vehicles. management would work with you when they could. Overall I enjoyed my time with Walmart.
good,Enjoyed working there.  Great opportunities.  It is challenging day by day. Great group of people work there.  Helps you to connect with the community
good,Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe e organizar meu tempo de trabalho
good,"Empresa razoável,mas boa de se trabalhar.Porém ofereçe pouca oportunidade de crescimento pessoal"
good,"Walmart in of itself isn't a bad company, but your experience can turn really sour if you happen to be placed in a bad store. You may encounter employee drama, shady management practices etc. My time working there was fine up until our store  managers were being switched out like tag-team partners."
good,"Easy to get along with most co-workers, competitive workers. Days went by fairly quickly. As long as everybody understands and does their hobs properly the days go by smooth."
good,i work at walmart twice they ok hours was good its was a lot of work just for one person like me the some superviser was ok some wasnt but overall it was ok
good,Its an okay place to work some of the managers are nice and easy to talk to. It sometimes is hard to go to linch or break because of the fast pace working enviroment. They will put you where ever you are needed and they offer a huge discount for working holidays. Its a good place to start out at. Also the beginning of every year you will get a raise.
good,The management sucks at certain facilities. Very cool place to work if you don't let your feelings get the best of you. Very interesting and different customers.
good,"I met a lot of cool people. Employees and customers. I would work there again if I needed to. Everybody was pretty relaxed, unless the corporate people came in."
good,"A typical day at work Walmart consist of taking care of customers with great customer service skills. I learn how to time make customers happy, time management, and money counting skills. Working smart to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is working alone on a busy day. The best part is staying busy, knowing how to do your job, stock,401k, and taking care of customers."
good,"The work environment was amazing, most people treated each other as family. but any sort of improvement in the career was super competitive and highly unlikely. They were super nice about giving days off if you needed them for family emergencies, school and even vacation."
good,"they had a lot of goods there i loved helping people when needed "
good,"As a Wal-Mart associate I work under hardware. I have learned to operate the paint machine, where to place freight, Bin merchandise, and many other skills and responsibility. At times it can be a very fast work environment. Your constantly communicating and moving around the store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable customers. Its not as discouraging though. people are people. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.I have managed to meet new interesting people at the store. Working there is not as bad as I thought."
good,Every shift I would always clock in and go to the back and work on training that was on a computer that everyone who is new is required to take (don't worry it's not hard just tedious). after about an hour I would go up front and clock onto a register and check out people anywhere from 4-8 hours a day with breaks ever 2 hours
good,No complaints with Walmart. I worked as an Asset Protection Associate and moved on to the Meat Department. They treated me very good at the store I worked in.
good,"Empresa de grande porte, com grande rotatividade de funcionários, salários sem diferencial entre os profissionais."
good,Les gens sont pour la plupart amicale et on une bonne esprit d'équipe.
good,The work place environment was a great place to work in it was the management that wasnt that good. scheduling wasnt done to fit the department for coverage.
good,"I enjoy working overnights, downside is having to ask for more days on the schedule. Management is nice to work with and they are willing to work around your schedule if you are working for another company."
good,some store Mgr are good some are bad training was very good some holed jobs they should not have personel mgr was very mean to some super nice to others i like the ones who tried to work very hard for low pay  they wanted to work ane move up
good,J'aime bien travailler chez walmart c'est un espace de travail securitaire et agréable.  Mes collègues  de travail sont sympatique et les condition de travail sont agréable
good,Mangers at Walmart never seem to be one the same page with everyone else therefore resulting in inconsistent information relayed to the the employees. The work is very demanding and you have to meet a task time other wise you will get reprimanded on slowness.
good,you are constantly working except for your break or lunch - their is never any time to breath or relax on the job -- always something to do - it's a matter of priorities but you are always moving - you don;t need to go to the gym if you work for Walmart
good,Management was practical and a typical day at work was tiring . It is a  fast paced work place and if you’re units were not up you’d be sent home . You either worked til you hurt or be sent home without pay .
good,"Walmart was a fun experience, I made a lot of friends there. It was a lot of work to do, but it was easy and made the day go by a lot faster, some customers are rude but you'll get over it."
good,walmart is a decent place to work it steady and stable not so much for growth but other than that its a decent place I liked it but you don't really go no were unless you are in good with management
good,"Un gran respeto por el individuo, integridad y apoyo."
good,the people are friendly and productive.  the backroom is where i worked and it wasnt anythibg like the front its much more harder working back there but is you can work hard its easy
good,"Working for Walmart I learned speed, communication, politeness, patience, Independence, friendliness, also no matter the situation customers are always right. I know all the departments at Walmart, and feel like I don't have the right option's to move forward with my career."
good,I enjoyed working with customers. Be sure to be accurate and fast. learned codes. The staff is helpful and friendly. U can move up in the company if you want within 6 months.
good,I was an inventory Associate but trained in a few other things the job was fun with my coworkers but when management wasn't up to date on things it got a bit hectic
good,"Walmart is a super fast paced work environment..red bull/rock star and monster energy drinks are consumed like water. Never a dull day, associates will run you ragged on mundane issues while corporate(market/region/division) keep the pressure on as well as emphasis on the ever evolving new and better processes. My only complaint was no work/life balance for management. Interestingly enough department managers and support managers/hourly,have great schedules and 40hrs.(OT is voluntary and rare at a well run store). A common misnomer is that associates don't get many hours and suffer low wages. Hard working associates get hours and raises...go figure. Many part timers are students and retired and"
good,"The work is very simple, but requires teamwork. You must be a team player and have good communication and conflict resolution skills. The work is split between team work when unloading trucks, and individual work when stocking shelves. Make sure that you can lift heavy boxes and work in hot conditions for at least 2 hours at a time. You must work quickly and efficiently to get everything sorted in the allotted amount of time. If you appear to be lazy or slow, then your teammates will quickly realize this and pressure you to do better. If your performance falls too low, then management will give you a warning and proceed with disciplinary action if work does not improve."
good,Good benefits and pay. Adequate training...sometimes too much. Fast paced. Promotes a team environment. A diverse group of employees. Room for advancement.
good,Walmart is a good starting point for retail and management is ok. They will try and work with you as best they can weather or not your full time or part time. Not something I would recommend making a career out of though.
good,"Pros: Good starting pay. "
good,"Despite working weekend nights the enviroment was very helpful, and flexible, once i became a full time employee the bi-weekly pays wear challenging for a single parent."
good,"When I was hired, I was told I would be in the management training class and be an assistant manager in 8 weeks. Later the boss of the man who hired me said that the person who hired me had no authority to decide who entered the management training class. The big boss would not even interview me - to teach a lesson to the guy who hired me. I stayed there until a good job opened at Amarillo College."
good,"Associates going over their job title of sales associate: Take responsibility for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays. Sales associates also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products. Plus much more i through out the store. Like I described in my work while in Walmart."
good,Their PTO and insurance system is very agreeing. The atmosphere is very accepting and enjoyable. Job advancement and low pay are the only two down sides.
good,Es una empresa que me ha ensañado mucho... la oportunidad de crecer está ahí siempre y cuando se tengan aptitudes importantes para desempeñar un determinado puesto.
good,"I really enjoyed Walmart, I worked there multiple times. I loved the people I worked with in the front end team. You did not get benefits unless you were working full time. Even if you worked full time hours but your job description had you has part time you did not get benefits. Management was great there, I enjoyed going to work everyday."
good,"Always push yourself to learn more. Set your goals high. Learn about different area of the store, keep your availability open. Always greet and assist the customer."
good,Working at Walmart was great. I worked graveyards replenishing shelves. Started working in mornings as a fashion processor as well as department manager duties. Worked in the UPC office for a year and did all the ordering for the store. Management wasn't that great.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Competitive pay, bonuses and you get a discount card for 10 percent off purchases. It was fun yet a bit stressful at the same time."
good,"walmart was a very good workplace, It was something new to do everyday its just a job full of surprises. I was excited to show up to work and perform my job duties."
good,"Everyday we start we a meeting, I learned a lot about teamwork, my manager was a great person, the hardest part about my job it was overnight, and the most enjoyable thing about my job was the customers."
good,Working at the Walmart environment always was comfortable and always in order.My employees And managers had great attitudes and we all worked as a team during my time at Walmart. I learned great communicating skills By helping customers and also how to organize my stock to be More beneficial for my departments.
good,"My work days would consist of frying chicken and other edible sides. I also maintained my kitchen area, while keeping up with on floor duties. I would slice deli cheese and meats as well per order. I also made subs, salads, pinwheels, catering orders, meat platters, and more."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. They made coming to work fun and helped the time go by faster. There was always something new to look forward to during each shift, from helping customers to stocking goods."
good,I liked working at walmart for the most part.I diddnt like that your co-workers would talk to you like you diddnt know any thing.I did like the breaks you would beable to take alot of breaks if you were working all day.
good,"I worked for several different  Wal-Mart locations throughout my career and all have been pleasant to work for....great team oriented, customer service oriented, fast paced with goal set structure."
good,"As a Customer Service Supervisor I was to run the front end. Great and take care of the customers needs and wants. I also took care of the money pulls from the registers. As I worked at Wal-Mart, I had many jobs including cashier, stocker and customer service."
good,"i worked at walmart back in 2000 and in 2017..the one in 2017 i recently left because they have you fill out your availability to work and they hired me saying my availabilty would be great but then when hired they kept scheduling me outside of my availability. I am also a caregiver to my husband, a disabled veteran so i had to have a certain day off during week to schedule his appointments and i couldnt work past a certain time at night so that i could make sure he took meds and someone was with him and they kept scheduling me past those times or on the days (which was a a consistant day off during week, wednesday) and i couldnt stay. i liked the job itself, i like being cashier and talking to people and helping."
good,all I ever did at walmart was help help the customer s in every aspect of the word in whatever dept. I was in. most of the your co-workers are nice a pleasant to be around and great to work with around cool nice steady place to work
good,I would go back if offered with no hesitation  but they should give at least a dollar raise I loved that job and the people are fun to be around. They work with you if needed as well
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. They will work with you if you are going to school , have kids just about nothing. Long as you can work with them as well. Hoilday season is the crazy but the pay is worth it. Never a boring moment. Always something new to learn and you can move up pretty quick if you do the work. I enjoy my 12 years working there. But I needed a change. Would I go, yes. It is a great company to work for. Heath benefits , flex schedule , manger training program and more."
good,"It's pretty slow in the morning,however I have to cover multiple breaks.I've learned not to over work myself.The management team is ok,I really can't speak on them.When talking to different people of races,thats enjoyable."
good,"This can be a fast paced, fun place to work. It can get competitive from time to time and high stress outta nowhere depending on time of day and customer flow mixed with if there is enough employees to cover all parts of the customers needs"
good,"I stocked on third, so a typical day was pretty laid back. I stayed busy stocking which made my night go by faster. I did not work their long, but I learned that third shift was not for me being that I was attending school. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of my job was working third shift hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was being productive."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to assist customers. The hardest part is have a schedule that is not consistent and hour vary from week to week.
good,The company would be much better if you could advance in the company but they don't want anyone to be full time because they don't want to pay for the benefits for the person to become full time.
good,"At walmart, your work will sometimes go unnoticed. You could work extremely hard but still get paid the least. With a lack of advancement walmart is not a company I'd suggest full time"
good,"Es una buena empresa, pero es demasiado grande y me gustaria algo mas tranquilo."
good,"Walmart dose not discriminate the women works jest as hard as the man in every department, learned to work independently, And safely.to work as a team"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team. Also that management worked with my school schedule which allowed me to continue my education without interruption.
good,My first time working at Walmart was okay but the hours weren't too great at the Walmart I was working with. The management wasn't too great either and my superiors weren't really working with me. If I get hired at another Walmart I'm sure the management will be better but hopefully I can find that special one that will be the start of a career.
good,Walmart is a good place to work. I learned many thing working at walmart's pharmacy for example medication names what the medications are used for and so on. Working at walmart even helped me in school for my nursing major. The hardest part of the job is honestly pleasing the customers but in due time you'll get the hang of it the most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers and managers.
good,"I work in a distribution center so a typical day is shipping and unloading around 120,000 cases on any given shift. I've learned personality and likability go just as far as experience and education. Management is a juggling act of people and numbers to meet the goals of an area vs. the goals of the entire building. The Walmart Culture is one of high performance, and it is how we live out our Values of Service to the Customer, Respect for the Individual, Strive for Excellence. The hardest part of the job is finding ways to stay productive for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part would be meeting new and interesting people."
good,"I felt my Team and myself made a difference in what we did. We worked hard and enjoyed the work. Workplace culture was good but they often would make decisions quickly and laid off staff."
good,Working at my current Walmart is a good experience but at times favoritism gets thrown around and my hard work doesn't tend to ever be rewarded. Walmart in a whole is a great place to learn new skills in a work place such as communications and time management.
good,"Overall it was a great job, a lot of physical work and definitely learned how to do logistic work and gave us good breaks and a long lunch so it was good but the management wasn't really considerate"
good,Working at Walmart was an experience that I’m glad I was able to get. It has taught me something’s that I can carry with me through everyday life. I’m glad for relationships that I’ve established while working there with both the employees and customers.
good,"fast paced, constantly busy. Good pay and good benefits. Friendly environment. paid and unpaid time off. hardest part of the job would be that it is very hard labor so it is not for the weak."
good,Worked with varied customers and employees. working long hours and very stressful enviroment  were a downside to the job. Very good chance to work in many different areas within the store
good,"However as The inventory/UPC I had things differently than other employees. I had multiple duties to keep me busy, interacted with several other employees and management, and it was always fun to help out in other departments as needed."
good,"WAL-MART is a great company to work for if you just need a job that will pay pretty well above minimum wage, but it's hard to promote within the company unless you make the right connections."
good,Great job to advance in. Great benefits. The environment iis very encouraging would recommended this job to asnyone. They have bonus based on performance
good,"I really enjoyed my time there, the other employees in my department were really great and helpful. I would definitely love to work there again if given the opportunity."
good,Walmart is the retail capital of the United States. Very fast paced and busy most of the year. Provides good health benefits and management advancement opportunities.
good,"Friendly and fast passed. Love the customers. Needs to be more friendly to the employees, the schedules are good along with the time off. Mangers are good."
good,I started out working as a truck unloader for nearly five years and I enjoyed unloading trucks and when we were done we took the pallets to the department
good,My typical day included talking to and answering questions in a friendly manner the questions of customers. Ringing up and bagging customers' purchases while making sure that the customers leave with a happy and good experience at the store. I would make sure to keep my work area clean and keep an eye out for any shop lifting or spills that need to be taken care of.
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart, but I would like to try something different and venture out to different opportunities."
good,"Typical day includes, sorting the new freight that arrives off the trucks, and  taking loads to the sales floor to stock the shelves. "
good,"Wal-mart is a long standing conglomerate that has had decades of practice to perfect its internal structure, HR mediations, professionalism, and reliability. An excellent company to work for overall."
good,everyone is productive to the best of their ability and if someone doesnt know something about any aspect of the job at hand there is always someone there to help explain and inform what is to be done next and how it is to be done
good,"I’d recommend it. If you work hard, you’ll get opportunities to advance in the company. They pay decently and have great benefits. I was just ready for a change when I left."
good,Wal-mart was quick paced and fun environment to work in. Everyone got along with each other & was very organized. They based things off team work & alot of work got done that way.
good,Walmart was a fun place to work everyone around you was always greeting you and asking how was your day and all the customers were saying thank you for helping them
good,I was comfortable mostly with what was required and worked throughout the store and promoted to work in the Pharmacy for a time. I would work there again if you didn't have to stay on your feet so much. Office jobs are offered but fairly difficult to be promoted into.
good,Typical day at Walmart was crazy. I learned different departments and how they run things. Management was helpful. Workplace culture was diversity. The hardest part was being pregnant and trying to move things. I enjoyed work with my team member who was from another country.
good,My job is all about time.. time is important. Gotta make sure everything is done by a time before a time and at a time with so much to do with only so much time..its like a game..that i like to play for fun. I get things done.. on time or before time begun..
good,"I enjoyed many aspects of working at walmart, the fast paced, challenges and the meeting new people every day provided a funatmosphere most days.While, i did enjoy many aspect i however thought management could be better at conversing, and coaching there employees."
good,"The business itself is nice, but the amount of help you would have to complete a lot of the work would be minimal. They make you feel a part of a family, so it’s a nice place to be around."
good,I worked in the meat department. I loved the environment wasn’t face-paced but as long as you stayed moving the job was pretty easy. The job wasn’t too demanding.
good,"This being my first job, it was stressful because I never stood on my feet for hours before. but after 2 years I got used to it and managed it. I learned how to work register and work in different departments as well."
good,"Working at Walmart has been an learning experience for me. I have learned to work with many different managers, they each show me different ideas and way to deal with customers and other coworkers. This job have taught me things that i will continue to take with me for job opportunities in the future."
good,"I love it. walmart was my first job and I love the independent job I was doing like cleaning the bathroom, floors, and back rooms. Going outside get the cart was hard but was good because of the fresh air"
good,No one ever knows what’s going on in management. Everything is on the spot with no planning. Customer first scheduling starts in janurary and they basically having you bouncing around on your schedule.
good,"Walmart is a good first job,or a job between jobs, but I wouldn't say it's a job you can support your family on for a lengthy period of time. You can get by but barely."
good,"Pays well where I live in Oklahoma. Flexible with hours. Hard job, mildly incompetent management minus store manager. hectic 50% of the time, and they could hire a few more people."
good,"great place to work, was good people to work with, managment worked with associates, to get there jobs done properly. i knew what i was going to do as my daily assignment ."
good,buena convivencia con los compañeros y supervisores del area.
good,It was a wonderful atmosphere of collaboration. The management was willing to work with you so long as you communicated with them in terms of what you needed to do in your personal life or if you were wanting more hours
good,"A well balanced work that strives off of part time help. Great on providing yearly pay raises, growth and providing advancements for the new staff."
good,"Something  different  every day ,which  makes the job challenging."
good,"great job, good pay, paid time off, great team and management, strict rules, strict production requirements but are easily achievable if you work hard."
good,"Working in the back on unloading truck with multiple people was a handful especially when it takes 1 person to slow down workflow of everyone. Every day for a year was like seeing a new face and they got more and more depressing looking as they came. "
good,"um dia tipico de trabalho e aquele dia que é corrido carregamento chegando com produtor da loja, reabastecer os produtos nos corredores atendendo os clientes com boa educação e ótimo dinâmica para que o cliente se sinta bem e com confiança que ali é o melhor lugar para comprar não só pelo preço encontrado mais também pelo atendimento diferenciado. "
good,"es una empresa que permite aprender mucho, estabilidad laboral, capacitación y ritmo de trabajo"
good,"good atmosphere. Good people and management. There were times when you could joke around and have fun with your job. I mostly enjoyed seeing different faces everyday and I would even have repeat customers because they enjoyed me as their cashier. I like the fast paced person after person, transaction after transaction."
good,"Fue un trabajo sin muchas complicaciones y con mucho apoyo por parte de los directivos y de todo el personal, esa fue la parte que mas me agrado."
good,i work cashier helping people work on customer service money orders car payments stocking shavels up merchandise its a fun place work as team hours i like flax
good,I could probably work at Walmart again.  They definitely have created a strong company structure with potential for advancement. The main reason I left was lack of pay.  I feel that the overnight sales associate that also stocks merchandise and unloads daily shipment trucks should make more than $10.00 per hour.
good,"Started my day unloading the produce from a truck, then I would stock the produce accordingly. After the fruits and vegetables were stocked I would clean up after."
good,Great job to work at but too many employees and hours were decreased for senior employees. Benefits took too long to accumulate due to poor management.
good,Walmart is a decent place to work. It has its flaws like every place but for the most part was enjoyable. Biggest complaint is scheduling. They are always changing your schedule with no notice.
good,"The people at Walmart, are nice and very friendly. The company as a whole, has a very bad turn over on employment. Other than that it is a pleasant place to shop at."
good,walmart is a great place to work considering that they pay you benefits and have to ask for over time which is rare but still and option never the less
good,"Working at Walmart is can be very fun.  The whole store is a team based operation.  If one person messes up on a different shift, things can get difficult for every one.  If you want to move up in the company, do it as soon as you are off of probation.  It isn't that hard to work here.  Management mostly have their hands tied, or they simply forget about you.  But at least personal is on your side."
good,"4 or 5 8 hour shifts plus school is too much"
good,I worked at Walmart while i was attending college so it was the perfect job to go to after classes. There were a lot of college students working there like me so it was a fun environment for me. Management is great. I could pick up extra shifts when I was on break or during the summer. I wouldnt work there now as I have little kids and a family to tend to. You have to have great availability to be able to work there.
good,I enjoyed working there even though our manager would talk to us like we were children. after I got into my car accident I wasn't able to work there because when it happened I didn't have many days off left for myself and they used that against me and my doctor didn't even the sign off the papers I needed for the aftermath at work.
good,Walmart is a productive and fun workplace. Since working there I've gain friendships and made connections with customers that I've came into contact with.
good,"management works more than employees, don't like schedules like you end at 12am and start next day at 5am so then they expect you to do a good job but you will be sleepy, tired and cranky. No overtime and that sucks."
good,es una buena empresa te ayuda pero aveses los encargados del area son muy prepotentes y tienen privileegios para otras oersonas mas antiguas
good,I loved this job until we hired some very unethical new management despite really enjoying my job i could no longer continue to work for them as a felt my manger was punishing me for changing my avialibilty and having to take time off due to and ill family member
good,"Meu tempo nesta empresa foi bom até, mas teve algumas coisas que eles não poderiam ter feito lá que me deixou chateado, mas agora algumas coisas mudaram pelo que eu soube por outros funcionários, esta melhor de trabalhar e o salario esta bom também."
good,I have learned a lot through this job since it was my first job. I learned on how to confidently talk to customers since I was very shy back then. I also gained many experiences and self-confidence
good,Typically told i would start as a stocker but ended up as a cashier.  however was utilizing skills normally a CSR or Assistant Manager would and should do but due to being short staffed I would help out.
good,The company provides good health and 401 k benefits. They work with your time for your schedule they have many different shifts to pick from. After a certain time with the company they will provide you with a employee discount card that’s a plus.
good,"a typical day would be easy at first but there was a problem with people calling in, management wast the greatest. hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and trying to put all of the stock out in a days of work due to people not showing up to work"
good,You are in complete control of your success and advancement. Job opportunities are ever present if you are willing to put in work and time to bettering yourself and advancing your skills in the workplace.
good,It's a large place with lots and lots of people so it is easy to get lost in the crowd but for the most part the other staff and management are great to work with.
good,"Stocking shelves, helping co-workers, unloading trucks. What I learned was how to work with others to get your work done faster. Quiet and slow-paced."
good,"My typical day starts with greeting and helping customers, exchanges, returns, price checks and more. I learned that in customer service its hard to please everyone no matter how hard you try."
good,At Walmart you never had to worry about not doing anything everyday working their was a adventure. you meet new people and you instantly form a bond with everyone you meet. at times you would encounter rude and mean bosses. the hardest part of the job is that you need to understand that the costumer is always right even though u have to bite your own tongue
good,"Hot humid summers and cold timid winters are endured slaving under dirty vehicles in the Automotive Center."
good,I liked working at Walmart because it was giving me the experience of my very first job but sadly was far too cold for my liking and the pay was simply not enough.
good,"A typical day would be right after clocking in and go wait until the staff meeting starts. Be told which station I'd be working in and right we are dismissed. I'm on my way to start stocking and organizing everything onto the shelves."
good,Walmart was there at a time that I needed extra money for the household and was unable to work full time. I was able to move into a position that I was able to help the customer and talk with them more.
good,"I enjoyed working there! It was a stressful, time-stricken environment at times, but I made a lot of friends which made the day go by nicely. Management was difficult at times, but many other times they were wonderfully helpful. Walmart is a nice place to work!"
good,"it was fun. I got to talk to people, help people, meet great people, easy to talk to management, it was truly a great learning opportunity. the only thing to didn't like about the whole experience is that I was let over points. My hardest day was when I to run between three different departments but it was my enjoyable day. I had one customer I helped the way no else could that was happiest day in my adult life."
good,Its a good place to work but could be better.If you want to meet new people you should work at wall mart.However there's a small problem that's the electronic area stay messy..
good,"Training  are very useful. Learnt lot about customer service, workplace environment, safety of workplace. Getting associates on time for training is very challenging sometime."
good,"Worked with payroll on daily basis, power points, special projects, and help associates with their needs concerning to insurance, PTO, Leave of Absence."
good,It was an overall cool place to work. You meet new people everyday but you treat every customer nicely and with respect. Also my co workers was easy to work with.
good,"It is a fast pace job during the day, nights are not so much fast but you have things to do. The pay is good for both day and nights, schedule is pretty much set so sometimes asking days off can be hard."
good,I learned a lot at this job I was a sales associate my job was to put merchandise out on the floor at the grocery department zooned the aisle make sure everything was in place a assessable for customers to find help customers out with anything they needed
good,"If you have the right drive and attitude Walmart can make you a lot of money. Even though I no longer work there it was a part of my life for a long time, and it was worth it."
good,"Be yourself an work your best , I was unloading truck loading truck , operating forklift, operating pallet jack, stocking goods , ensures customers meet there needs"
good,"it was a good place to work, mist people were nice. The could be alot better for the work you do, Most of the time I was doing the work of 4 to 5 people and not getting paid my worth."
good,"high stress work environment"
good,Working at Walmart the shifts are very long unless it’s busy. Management was rude often times. Sometimes if would be the best job I’ve ever had and then some days i would be on the verge of quitting and never looking back. But that’s any job you get.
good,"fast pace but manageable, easy, coworkers are nice and try to help(SOME MANAGERS ASWELL) paid nicely and plenty of room for promotion or raise. would definitely recommend."
good,its an competitive working environment solely because everything is based off production. which is not hard to get long as you comfortable working in an constant pace
good,Great place to work especially for people that love a high paced environment. Opportunity to learn different positions. Management is very professional and understanding. Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that the customer is happy when leaving our store.
good,"Walmart was a fantastic job opportunity , welcoming and very patient and helpful staff members. Overall a idealistic work environment , i personally just couldn't withstand the harsh overnight labor."
good,Very great place to work a wide verity place to work. You might start is one department  then moved or told to go and help another area that you might not know anything about. They you are still reasonable for your home area for job duties. and if you don't get them done then you could loose your job or get written up. for not finishing on time. Great customers friendly staff  great health benefits  Managers are just Okay as long as you stay on there good side.
good,"The area I used to work in was slow, but steady. The store was kept clean, and the departments were always neat. The customer flow wasn't overbearing."
good,"While no company is perfect, Walmart is an excellent employer.  Management is supportive and the whole store - the whole company - is one team committed to success, on an individual level as well as corporate.  The work can be physically exhausting, and sometimes mentally as well since associates are interacting with everyone in the public.  Frustrating situations do occur, but at Walmart the associates always look out for each other."
good,"its no surprise that your just a number with Walmart, I felt that was fine because of the pay. problems were sometimes dealt with very slowly. overall a good place to work"
good,"I have had several years of experience working for this company. Overall, the experience has been great. They tend to take really good care of thier employees. Environment is fast paced and competitive. There is always room for advancement if you are looking for a career with the company."

good,working for walmart was fun and easy to climb and learn new tasks. the managers will work with you to help with any task at hand. the hours were great.
good,Most days is unloading trucks and putting out the items and then other days is just zoning the whole store for 8 hours  most enjoyable part of the job is when there store is closed so we can putbthe truck away
good,"the last 4 years at Walmart I worked in the Pharmacy.  I worked with the pharmacist counting medication, calling customers to let them know their medication was ready.  And I was the cashier to look up customer information on the cash register and take money from the customer.Greet each customer and hopefully make their day pleasant."
good,Una empresas donde se puede trabajar a gusto bajo las normas establecidas
good,"empresa boa de se trabalha ,a gerencia muito boa e liderança"
good,"You don't have a lot of down time working at Walmart. That can be a good thing (makes the time go by fast) but it can also be a bad thing if you can't be on your feet for long periods of time. Generally though, the pay/hours are worth the hassle and you tend to meet all kinds orly different people, which personally is exciting to me."

good,"loved my job at Wal-Mart, fast paced, friendly customers. I learned to help people and give back. most managers were fair, some not. I always treated people with respect, in hopes I was treated the same. I thinking the hardest part of my job was dealing with a very upset customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a customer leave my store with a smile on their face."
good,This job is a very enjoy great enjoyable environment minimum wage pay but overtime is available for full time employees this is a good company to work for just starting out in the work field or retired
good,It was a good seasonal job. The only real bad part was the chaos between assistant managers. I feel like there is too much management so you can be given one set of orders then get yelled at for fallowing them.
good,Management was bad. When I worked at Walmart I had a manager that constantly made fun of me and was rude. He had certain life choices that I would not agree with with my religion but I was very kind to him. He knew what my religion was and decided to take it out on me and it got so bad that I had to leave.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart, for me at least, was fairly easy. I was a cashier, but was able to fil any role as needed. The people were friendly and management was understanding."
good,"Good hours, have great communication with employees.Training is the key to develop good employee and a company that offers that has great results.They care about their employees."
good,I really liked working here. I was always busy. I loved having conversations with customers and keeping a smile on my face at all times. It really helped me boost my self-confidence.
good,"Its a great place to work, especially if your looking for part time work great for college students or for someone looking to make extra money, I enjoyed working with the customers,"
good,On this job I was reliable... Independent... Kept customers happy...on time..planning on making this my place to stay but got termites BC guilty by association by help an employee back and fourth to work...can explain
good,"Nice place to work, good for all types of people, entry level, retired, military, etc. Great place to learn retail, will set you up to succeed in other retail or warehouse businesses. If you want to excel this is the place to work. If you just want to live paycheck to paycheck... this is also the place to work. Anybody can thrive or survive here, what you get out of it is entirely up to you."
good,"It is very fast paced, their expectations of you are high, but there is plenty of opportunity for advancement in my experience.  The only complaint I have is that management knowingly put too much on your ""to-do"" list then penalized you for not completing everything."
good,Working at walmart gave a great insight into how the company runs and had much to teach but management set unrealistic goals for backroom associates to achieve and would often hold meetings to tell associates how poorly their performance was even when performance was running efficiently. Very diverse workplace and many different types of people to get to know from all different backgrounds. Hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines but most enjoyable was the coworkers.
good,"Work until  job is finished.  Learned every aspect of working a retail business includiing but not limited to: front office, loading and unloading of trucks, merchandising, running equipment ,the  personnel.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours but the best part was feeling a sense of accomplishment."
good,"The most important thing about Walmart is Customer service and secure environment."
good,Not much to do around Wal-Mart unless you know the right people everyone is super friendly but its not a very busy store 90% of the time I was walking around twiddling my thumbs then  working
good,"For a person who is either college educated or desire to attend college, Wal-Mart should be a temporary job. There is no cognitive challenge. Everything is about making money (because it's a store) and keeping customers happy (so they spend more money), and that means every worker must do what they can to make those goals happen."
good,"I loved the other associates and managers. The job itself was stressful at times but fast paced most of the time. The customers were your average customers, you can not please everyone but the good customers were amazing."
good,The Job is a decent . I loved working with a lot of people there. My issue was with the store manager. Environment is ok.  I learned alot but i also had customer service experience which made a difference.
good,Typical work day for me was just to unload trucks.  I learned a lot on how to unload the trucks as fast as possible and which type of power equipment you need to do your job successfully.  Hardest part of the job was unloading floor loads.  What made the job fun was the competition between the associates.
good,Management is nice strict on rules its a very friendly active place. To be the employees are nice friendly and caring. Thw work is not hard if u work with a sense of purpose and strive at your best
good,I was a fine place to work sometime there was scheduling problems but other than that wal-mart is a great place to work. Everyplace will have it ups and downs but I think it is a good first job.
good,"It was a good job, very friendly people. The worst part was the angry costumers.The management was great. The most enjoyable part was being able to turn a costumers day from bad to good with just a friendly smile."
good,"Walmart careers as a whole seem stable and secure. However the culture and attitudes to micro manage everyone and everything, often is a bit too much.."
good,"loved that I was always busy made my days go by a lot quicker. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and I miss the family and friends that I made there, made work so much funner"
good,"Es una buena empresa, con oportunidades de crecimiento."
good,I worked in an area where everyone knew everyone so it was very difficult not to become close to your coworkers.  I learned the importance of friendly customer service and how to work through a bad day still with a smile.
good,"-energetic place to work"
good,fill non-conveyable orders and took to shipping to load. Constant heavy lifting. No time to mess around all jobs are quota based. Attendance and Safety is everything. Employee's are responsible for avoiding all accidents.
good,"good relaxing laid back job, do ur work as ask and should remain easy. pay is pretty decent it could be more but its customer service."
good,In my time at Wal-Mart I enjoyed it. As a night shift stocker and a very goal oriented person it allowed me to challenge myself and the crew I worked with.
good,"It’s a good job with good benefits but I’d like to try other jobs. I don’t mind working nights and most weekends, but hope to find a job with more weekends off regularly, and I’d also like to work a day shift at some point."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work because it has a deep culture. There are a lot of great people who have worked there for their entire lives. However, the issue is those who don't like change, will make life harder for those who accept the changes. This mainly pertains to the salaried level of management or higher. I was fortunate because I had a fantastic store manager and a great team of assistant managers who really made me feel welcome and helped guide me throughout my time there. However, I have heard that my case, which I share often because it's been great, is a rarity. After transferring from one store to another, I started to see what they meant. A lot of the times I meet with managers who just pencil whip tasks so they can move on to the next one. I currently have a boss who thinks they know how to lead a team, but the only time things run smoothly is when they're not there. That's why I feel that it's a great place to work, and it can be a difficult place to work. It all depends on what kind of team and store you get."
good,"Loved working with people, Stocking shelves, helping customers, and getting things ready for the next morning. I learned to be a lot more social. I took the job to make myself talk to people. I can now strike up a conversation with almost anyone anywhere. Loved the hour long lunch, helping customers, left for a better paying more hours job."
good,"a typical day at walmart was rounding up carts , helping customers with heavy lifting, sometimes helping the unloaders with the trucks. even though management was poor i made sure i didnt let hat affect the outcome of me doing my job. the hardest part of the job was when the heat was really high or when it was pouring down raining and we were not provided the proper gear to keep doing the job."
good,I loved working there it’s just that not a lot of work going on there less hours and not getting paid enough to make rent.. been working there for about 6 months and they promised us 40 hours or more but only been getting 20 hours
good,Family atmosphere.  Discounts given on purchases.  Growth opportunity available to a certain extent.  Best part of the day for me was customer and associate interactions.
good,"Walmart is an excellent place to work."
good,"Walmart was a place to work for starters. Great for students as well. You can have your schedule fit into your everyday life, such as class, daycare hours, and so much more."
good,"Flexibilirty is great, the pay leaves alot to be desired especially with the new systems put in place to ""track"" employees raises are not given so there is no real reason to stay"
good,Was pleased with how the overnight crew worked.  Pay was fair and the atmosphere was appropriate.  Would recommend Walmart company as a starting job for entry level applicants.
good,Very fast paced and competitive. Difficult to meet production standards. Great training and a great manager. Great schedule and nice to have 4 days off per week.
good,This was a good job for me to start out in. It helped me with being used to work. I like the job because I loved working with the coworkers that I worked with.
good,walmart est une bonne entreprise qui se souci de ses employés et  qui donne de bonne condition de travail
good,Walmart was a great way to gain experience in job skills. They were willing to show their Employees how to perform different job tasked which can help with other jobs.
good,t work i learned how to treat people to keep them happy and how to become a more motivated worker which provides better social skills. with a nice well kept work place the hardest part of my job was managing to work through line interruptions while not upsetting customers and still preforming your requirements
good,Wal-Mart is good job for young people that's attending school. it also can be a good long term job with good benefits if you want to turn it into a career. But I don't feel like Wal-marts the place to work if your trying to provide for a family and live a stable life. But I enjoyed to flexible schedule and freedom. I also worked at my own paste so I was never really tired or wore out unless I worked multiple days.
good,I like working at Wal-Mart I felt that I had job security and I new they had a competitive salary scale.  I think Wal-Mart is a good company if you're looking for job stability and advancement.
good,"walmart was a fun and enjoyable place to work, lots of benefits and perks to the job, over all i enjoyed working there, friendly staff and excellent co-workers"
good,Lost of favoritism is shown in this work place environment. They try to make it seem like they’re the best company to work for and they are for the most part but it’s a joke at times.
good,"Wal-Mart, "
good,"though i was fired for tardiness that i dont feel was 100% my fault, the job in it of itself was easy and manageable. I liked my fellow co-workers, i just didnt necessarily like the customers. Whatever job you're assigned, its easy to wrap your mind around and perform."
good,Be ready to get stuff done and do it right. Don't slack off and pay attention. It can get rough but some managers are very nice and do try to help. I went through tough times and they tried to give me options on how they could help.
good,"Wal-Mart makes it's people work. if you are intentionally slow, lazy and unmotivated, you will not do well with the managers or your co-workers, who have to take up your slack every night. Most people keep it simple by showing up, doing their job and clocking out."
good,Love working with people and making sure the customer is satisfied. Great environment and location and it is a great job. The culture is unique in its own way.
good,"Overall it’s a great place to work, advancement is not as easy to come by. They keep you where they think is better suited for you without seeing if you are better in a different area."
good,At first I thought they were pretty organized.the csm's were not no communication.need to take classes on how to treat the cashier's and cart pusher's with some manners and how and when to use them.the store would run a bit better font you think? I do
good,"Most days I would have freight to work on.  There were always customers to wait on, or ears to pierce. Jewelry and shoe department were under the same department manager so I was also responsible for shoes as well."
good,I learned a lot.  The job allowed me to grow my skill and advance my career. The management for the most part was good but way to much turnover.  I liked the work area and had all the required tools.
good,"Good company to work for , great benefits , upper management can be political at time and have their own people to promote and not seeing other good associate with better knowledge"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for people that are career oriented towards retail, and for younger people that are looking to find a job and get into the work force."
good,"Fun place to work,  short breaks,  friendly atmosphere,  competitive environment,  good learning experience,  open door policy,  easy going environment"
good,"four star,  the most enjoyable part of the job is when I working, a typical day at work clocking, then go to the register star to work, and I love my job because I'm working with public."
good,"I moved around a lot and ended up working for walmart I worked in MS,HI,And two different in Florida. All except for one i had the chance to move up in and was regularly interviewed for management."
good,"Fun place to work but i found the work to be not very fulfilling and the store manager was kind of a jerk i think some of the managers were too easy on some of the employees .i was told to go get carts"
good,"Trabalho no período noturno ,Onde fiz boas amizades e foi um lugar agradável pra trabalha,Supervisor e gerencia sempre cordial e tentando ajudar o funcionário sempre que necessário"
good,I liked working on there very productive and you can have a chance to grow with the company. Very competitive and very easy to learn about the company and the stores.
good,"I was position in different jobs, like cashier, stocking, floors associate, ordering for departments, training other associates, and unloading trucks."
good,"typical day is I see a lot of different people everyday. "
good,"It was a great place to work. I enjoyed the employees and the customers. The hardest part of the job was when there was an unruly customer, or a shortage of staff to help us. The turnover rate was very high there, so I saw many new faces in my short time there."
good,It a great job but Walmart need fix all there store and management.think great place work not all time if don't want to move up in the company.love it
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart in the deli it was fast paced and friendly environment. I would recommend this place of work as one of the best places i have worked for.
good,"A typical day at work would include having 4-9 hour shifts (shorter shifts on weekdays, longer on weekends), the opportunity to meet new people every time you scan items, have interesting conversations occasionally, and meeting new co-workers. I learned a lot from this company since it was my first job. I was very shy at first and I learned how not to be since I communicated with customers daily. The workplace was very stressful around holidays and it really tested my patience but I got through it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my first difficult customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new co-workers that would become my friends."
good,falta un mejor sueldo como tambien mas retroactivos como empleado
good,"Overall, Walmart is a great place to work! I work in the pharmacy, where we tend to stay on the busy side (not saying the rest of the store isn't busy.) We tend to get overtime, which is nice, but also hectic at the same time. Except long lines if you are working the registers in the pharmacy, and don't except the customers to be friendly. Of course, some of them will be friendly; however, most of them are rude, and not understanding of the wait times and the ordering systems. Be a team player, learn to work with different people. We all have different ideas. Communication is vital in this field. Your pharmacy team is your family- that is your support. The rest of the store, is your Walmart family, but you won't get half as close to them as you do, as your pharmacy family. Be ready to be independent! "
good,"The work environment provided was comfortable and friendly. Even if you have a specific position or role you are often moved around to try and complete other tasks. Multiple managers, but this caused inconsistency in directions and some frustration. Managers where very lenient in general because the work was rather simple and always got done anyway. The most enjoyable part of the job was the independent work (if you chose) or the option to work with other associates. The hardest part of the job was definitely finishing one task, it always seemed like someone was trying to pull you so that you could complete another task."
good,"Key role of an associate is to provide excellent customer service to the customers"
good,I would work there again of I could I really enjoyed it the staff are always very friendly you are constantly busy so you don't get bored easy crew to work with
good,I enjoyed most of my time at Wal Mart for the most part. Some of the customers become regular faces you get use to seeing and connecting with. the co workers for the most part are very cool and a joy to work with.
good,Great place to work . great managers. Great employees.really great benifits. Loves the discount card wish i still had it. Overall great job opportunity would return
good,"It's a great place to work, just and few cons that could be fixed. Typical work day I go in check schedule and what audits need to be done. Get with over co-workers to switch over and greet the cashiers."
good,Developed safe and efficient habits to maximize performance. Assisted in creating a positive and safe atmosphere with my co-workers. Maintained a register and duties in multiple departments.
good,As an employee at Walmart you are considered an important part of the company.  Management is fair and considerate of store employees. I learned the customer is the reason Walmart exist.
good,I was slow and needed to work on keeping up so that  was the pressure that lead me to quit.  I dread the box sorting and and the pet ills.... there were nice managers/ assistant managers that were just trying get people  like me to speed up when I felt like I was going about as fast as I could I quit before they would fire me.
good,Walmart I think is a good place to work. I was just traveling to far everyday for the location i was in. They have a 401k and stock options. Along with many perks and discounts
good,"Great place to work, mostly understanding, but for sure have to talk to everyone yourself due to no communication. But over all lots of great people and great benifits and chances to learn"
good,"I love coming to work everyday, I would be busy from the time I walked in to the time I left. Time would just fly by. We would have our frequent patients that would go by and wave to us just to say ""HI"". I enjoyed it. It also was closed to home . The hardest part of working there was when it was too busy and we did not have enough staff. It would be overwhelming."
good,I really liked being able to prove myself and being shown appreciation for it. I also liked the idea of employee ownership and the option to buy stock in the company.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, You make a fair salary and they have an above average bonus package. Hourly workers are compensated well for what they do."
good,"Fast paced, enjoyable on a typical day, I've learned patience, fairness, trust, happiness, empathy, honesty goes a long way. Management has its moments like everyone. Culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an irate customer or associate, Patience and listening and knowing how to handle the situation plays a great role in Customer Service and Satisfaction"
good,"En mandos medios la paga es ""buena"" sin embargo los jefes llegan a ser prepotentes y tener liderazgo autocrático."
good,one down fall is working in one department and getting pulled to cover one or two others. also only working four hour shifts sometimes two to three weeks at a time.
good,Great place to work and excellent for obtaining retail experience.  A company that believes in serving the customers well and strive for excellence. There is a good Health  Plan offered and also a Retirement Payment Plan. Your are also recognized for your work accomplishments through awards program.
good,"I liked working with the customers and most of my co-workers, my manager was fantastic and the hours weren't bad at all, overall, a great workplace!!!"
good,"Was an easy job, really all you do is stock, answer any customer questions, run register.  Not much else to say, show up and they will pay you, you don't even have to try hard"
good,"typical day at Walmart was stocking the walk in, cutting meet serving customers, cleaning as needed. what i learned at Walmart is team work is key, and they treat like family"
good,"Provides a quick paced environment that required multi-tasking. The management can be helpful but no not always know the policies. Job is satisfactory and challenging, and requires adaptability to the daily challenges of a community retail setting."
good,Very friendly and productive facility to work in. Management is fair and work hours are flexible. You can improve verbal communication skills by interacting with customers and other fellow associates.
good,"Great place for a beginner to accumulate experience. I learned a lot over the years, cross-trained in many areas. Depending on the store, management is understanding, and other co-workers are nice and helpful."
good,Overall provides room for advancement but take a long period of time to increase wages.  Training is not consistent throughout the company.  One best way is not practiced through0ut company.
good,Managed men's apparel daily department. Followed daily floor plan changes. Set up interviews for potential employees. Learned a lot more about the retail sales environment.
good,"A typical day at work would be zoning, doing returns and helping customers.  Listen to what the managers have to say and apply them to your work.  Getting to know your co-workers tends to be nice, gets you along with them, and so you can rely on them if you end up needing a bit help."
good,You have to have patience to work here. Management is poor and expects you to have all the time in the world for them. Alot of the time they are short staffed (increases Your work load)
good,Working with the associates gave me great pleasure but some of the management team made the job harder. There needs to be a more positive focus from management when dealing with the associates in the store I was located in. Walmart as a company has great benifits and does a lot for the communities they are located in.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a very good place to be introduced to the diversity we have here in the Unites States. I was always moving, stocking shelves or assisting customers."
good,Enjoyed doing invoicing and saving the company money by reducing shrink and putting more money to the bottom line. Teach and training new associates. Providing the best customer service to our customers.
good,"walmart was a fast and good working job, i loved working with the customers to get them in and out my line quickly and if asked everything they needed and or wanted help with ."
good,"maintained and repaired customer vehicle, workers in the department got along well. managers rotated througout the year sometimes was good sometimes not. was a balanced job."
good,Working at Walmart was a breeze compared to other jobs. As a laborer I found it as getting paid not to be overworked and get some extra pocket money. Walmart is also a great company to climb to ladder if you see that in your future. Management was great for me but understand I speak from a personal experience and not for all regions and districts.
good,"I started out as a cashier. Helping customers with their questions, quickly getting customers out with their groceries.  I was later moved to apparel.  Folding, stacking and organizing clothing.  And helping customers find anything they were looking for."
good,"This is my first time working for walmart,and it has taught me alot. I have been there five years.i really do enjoy working at walmart. Nice management,they care about there employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart and the environment and experience it provided. "
good,"All in all a great experience with a great team of fellow hard working individuals. My time there was excellent. Not only did I love my job I was proud to be an Assemble at Walmart. Wish I could do it again, but my health constraints do not allow for it."
good,I haven't worked in 9 years almost due to my kids having several health issues. i have a diabetic son so if his school calls saying he has to go home.
good,"Overtime depends on need and labor percentage. "
good,"I supervised about seven employees, I provided daily communications for tasked for the day. On a typical day i would place daily orders of store merchandise. Insure that all associated worked safe daily.  The work load was very faced paced. "
good,"everything is relatively good there, but the management is always on edge there. there is no typical day of work there. just because you got hired there for one thing does not mean your going to stay in that department. there is no guarantee for a single placement. the hardiest part for working for them i would have to say is worrying about getting a couching, there are so many things now that will lead up to that, its scary."
good,"You go in and get your work done, whether its cleaning up, finishing freight or zoning. Laid back environment but sometimes stressful on busy nights. Most nights if your work is done and nothing else is needed then they let you off early (on overnights)."
good,The management is laid back while still being firm. My favorite part of the job was working with the people and helping the customers. It was definitely hard to work there considering it was fast paced and you needed to be able to multi-task.
good,"enjoyed working at WALMART.  I enjoy meeting and talking with people.   I feel they do try to accommodate all working class i.e. disable/handicapped, elderly, youth etc.  Walmart has great benefits."
good,Ótima empresa para quem busca tranquilidade no dia a dia profissional. Aprendi muito no tempo que estive contribuindo para a empresa.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Walmart. It was hard work, but the corporate culture was positive and they were reasonably flexible. I only left the job because I moved."
good,"I loved working at the first two stores that I worked at. Great team work in the pharmacy and across the entire store. Our managers backed us it was a great experience. Then I moved to my last store, that was threaten by corporate weekly. I had to deal with people from home office on a daily basis and no one was on the same team. I had to document when I went on breaks and the ability to pump was awful. I was placed in a storage room that did not meet federal standards, but it was all they would give me."
good,"check out customers,greet customers, how to bag items, check out customers asap. red line, keep area neat & clean.Management was great, always a supervisor to answer your questions. Hardest part of job was keeping up speed on checkouts. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people & making new friends."
good,"I enjoyed working for walmart, i worked in the bakery and loved it. Only reason i left was because of relocation and they didnt process my transfer request, which kinda sucked."
good,"A fair and honest place of employment. Great travel compensation, above the national average. Overall a solid place to work and grow within a company."
good,"The company is one of the best places where you can start your career life, because you get to know too many things in the environment you are working at. Its a good way to explore aspects of such a huge employer by trying to work in every possible area of interest."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo siempre estas aprendiendo y muy buena cultura laboral por parte de la empresa
good,"While Wal-Mart as a whole wasn't always an enjoyable job I did learn a lot in my time there. I learned the proper way customer service is supposed to be carried out with patience and experience to better help and understand the customers needs. "
good,"Empresa bom de ser trabalhar os funcionários sempre em alto estima, trabalhando com competência e responsabilidade."
good,"Unless you're not trained on the cash register, you will be used at the register a lot because they don't have typically a lot of cashiers. Staff are friendly as are co-workers. You might get into a routine, but sometimes you will have to do what ever rises, namely giving breaks to other cashiers (if your register trained). You will still have to do everything your required though. During most of the month, you won't have a lot of hours and you have to struggle to get them, except the holidays are given more hours."
good,"Travailler chez Walmart Canada m’a permis de connaître moult systèmes du fonctionnement de travail tout le temps que j’ai travailler avec cette entreprise était un moment de plaisir et de joie. Je me suis senti dans une famille, dans un milieu social très ouverte à la portée de tout les employés sont tabous."
good,"My day at Walmart is pretty flexible.  Wherever I'm needed within the store, I tend to help.  I normally greet customers welcoming them into our store.  I check them out on the register, while providing the best customer service possible."
good,"I work well with others,fast learner, quick paste give good customer service double check my work,stocker,shipping,receaving,on time,help others,and good attendance"
good,"It was an experience working there, I learned alot about floor care. swept, mopped, cleaned bathrooms, made sure spills were cleaned up asap, picked up blue pallets at end of shift."
good,"Although I had quit due to a conflict in a misunderstanding with a manager, the particular Woodbridge, Virginia Walmart had a lively atmosphere where most if not all of the other managers encouraged growth. The fast pace was enjoyed, and it easily allows for morward forward."
good,Start work at 06:00 orderfilling orders to small or too large for conveyor system. I learned many management skills to help me advance at my current job.  Fast pace and demanding working environment.  The hardest part is the constant micromanagement.  Learning how to advance in my career is the most enjoyable thing and the many charitable events each year.
good,"Light hearted bunch of folks. Easy to work around other employees. They do give you two 15 minute breaks in eight hours. Online training on company history , how the store operates, and how to do your job."
good,Im new and this is only my 1st month working. My body hurts and i need to eat a lot in order not to get sick. It can be mentally exhausting as well. You need to be sharp and competent.
good,"A typical day was busy but fun"
good,"Long hours, good pay, mostly good people, some bad as anywhere else, stressful, competitive, lots of classes, good career options, cafeteria and coffee shops."
good,this was a a fun job while it lasted the empolyers & mangers was great to work with well most of them . it was very fast paced kept me on me feet for sure .
good,I enjoyed my time with company. I especially enjoyed all the people that I met. There is a GREAT group of employees there. They do a great job helping customers at least the dedicated ones.
good,"Overall my experience of Walmart has been pretty good. I met some interesting people, had fun, and enjoyed my work. The managers there were exceptional. I really never had any problems there except trying to support myself and family on $10 an hour."
good,It was comfortable with the help. My experience with the company was very  satisfying. I don't have anything complaints. I would have no problem being rehired.
good,"Walmart could be very stressful at times, but it was a good place to work.  There's always room to learn more and move up. Management was great. Walmart offers benefits for full-time associates."
good,"Perform cash transactions, Stock shelves, Inventory control, Customer service, Clean and organize"
good,A typical workday is normally 10- 12 hours. There is opportunities to get licensed on different equipment. Most of the managers are pretty cool long as you get your work done. Walmart has a strong culture geared towards customer satisfaction.
good,"Fast paced when you were busy, very slow if you were not. While the job was simple some customers could make for a long day. Pay and flexibility werent bad"
good,"work was fairly challenging, i did like the fact that they have an academy for all positions available. How ever management was not very professional, store manager as well as co managers, had no people skills, and never engaged with employees or customers."
good,"each department has different challenges and advance opportunities. the other associates are great to work with and are willing to help with someones weaknesses, (department is busy, unable to lift heavy objects, underage to operate machines)"
good,The best part about my job was helping people everyday with their customer service needs and helping them reach a very satisfactory shopping experience.
good,"ping pong table"
good,"When I started I worked as a cashier, The hours were somewhat chaotic. Then I moved to the grocery department and the hours were the same every week. Then they moved me to the garden shop and I still had stable hours. Then at the end of summer they put me back in the grocery side and the hours changed and I was not told of this so I got caned for no call no show because I only showed up on the days I was normally scheduled."
good,"Walmart is a great corporation to work for, the staff is very upbeat and is always looking for new ways to improve the company. I love helping customers and the atmosphere of helping others. The hardest part of the job is the hours, I am flexible but not enough hours are given."
good,I was hired for what I thought was long term with the store being brand new at the time but what I and others were actually hired for was to get the Store stocked and ready for the grand opening only to be let go two weeks after it open keeping only 15 of the of the 50 people hired for 3rd shift at the store.
good,"You will get what you give. Its a large company so there are challenges in communication. Especially when specific directions to specific subordinates are concerned. But if you do what you know you should, then its easy to enjoy it."
good,"foi bom o tempo que fiquei dentro da empresa, pois pude adquirir muita experiencia como pessoas e como profissional."
good,Very fast pace Hands-On job to work at the nights are actually fun the people are layed back  very safe place to work at good people to be around in the pay is awesome as well
good,"Working at Walmart as a cashier, you learn a lot of things, especially about your customers. You would come clock in and get on a register and start checking people's groceries out with a smile. The management would always know how to make you smile or laugh if you weren't already. Of course, there were certain managers that could make you laugh and smile way more than others. But I felt like the only hard things about this job were when manager got onto you because you didn't do something the right way or when a customer screams and curses at you because they don't like that you're not agreeing with them, but you just have to put that behind you and move on. Even with the rough days, there are good days. You have good associates to work with and you have amazing customers who love you."
good,I began as a deli worker and after working hard was able to be deli manager. I enjoyed my time there. My favorite part were the customers. I would have probably stayed but the management above me changed the hours and i was not able to work them at that time.
good,"While working for Walmart it allows for being able to work in different areas throughout the job. There is a possibility of advancement and also a chance to learn different areas in the job that make you a variable asset for the company,"
good,cumplir con el trabajo diario hacer reportes hacer junta con tema de inspiración y reflexión para mejorar el ambiente de trabajo
good,You meet new people everyday and it's easy to get along with co-workers. Walmart has a ll types of cultures and races mixed into one. I would recommend Walmart as a great place to work.
good,Great place to  work  if you have the right person  working with  include management  and associate  yes they treats you well  and so  on  overalls  it's ok
good,"Its and okay place to work. I usually come in and unload the trucks, stock fresh produce, and sometimes order new produce. I help customers and answer their questions."
good,"A Typical day of work was 6 to 8 hours a day with a one hour lunch break and two 15 minute breaks. I learn how to become a better inventory taker and stalker, how to to do Ticket Master sales and ticket printing."
good,this was My first job I retail and I had a blast the I was with was amazing we worked great together. never a Dull moment not to say it wasn't difficult it was very at times but you always felt satisfied with the work you did
good,"Many people that I worked with there had made it a career and had been in multiple positions within the company. During the year I was there, several people went from part time positions to department managers and one department manager moved to a different department management position that paid more. They are supportive about both moving up within the company and transferring to different stores. They're also good if you're like me and only want to work part-time, valuing balance over additional hours. I had no trouble receiving approval for a specific day off requested whether it was paid or unpaid. Their point system for call offs makes it easy to know where you stand; no worries about whether this call off will get you in trouble because as long as you stay within points, you're golden and no one will say anything."
good,i liked working at walmart but the other employees were a downer to me for always complaining about thier jobs or trying to shift tasks off to others a believe in team work
good,fast pace but slow at the same time. Time would go by slow. While you worked fairly fast. Most of the managers are lovely and will work with you and your schedule.
good,"Es una empresa que en los últimos tiempos ha crecido, la cual permite que haya oportunidad de desarrollo dentro de la misma."
good,normal day we get a lot of carts in a day. i learned how to keep the parking lot clean without rushing. the hardest part is when a cart pusher on another shift leaves the garage half empty. my most enjoyable thing about the job i get to interact with people.
good,Productive and fun you get to meet many people of all different cultures in costumers and  associates you learn a lot working as a cashier basic things
good,"excellent management, good schedules, fair to staff. Appreciative, the employee discount is nice. busy, makes the day go by fast. lots off chances for moving up in the company."
good,Walmart was a great place to work. The people around me mad the work place fun and enjoyable. management was outstanding. i was able to learn a range of different roles.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for.  The overnight shift is somewhat interesting to say the least.  Not a job for a family oriented person with young kids.
good,"working with great one on one with some great associates and managers, making sure the cashiers were takin care of. breaks lunches on time working in a timely manner."
good,"I didn't work there long enough to get any benefits or raises from the company because you don't get any of that until 6 months in but the benefits listed were everything you'd expect from a career "
good,"Fast paced environment with job advancement opportunities."
good,"It was very fast paced, customer service was very important! "
good,"I would show up and walk the floor of my departments. Then go to the back and get my administration paper work. Then I would walk back to the floor and get together with my associates, there we would set goals for the day.  I would also ask if they needed anything from me to do their job so they could be successful throughout the day.  "
good,"I have nothing bad to say about my time at Walmart. I worked hard, but was always fairly compensated and taken care of if I needed anything. "
good,"Typical day at work involved helping customers with purchases, and helping them buy phone plans that best suited their needs. If it was a prepaid phone I would set it up for them. If it was a contract phone I would enter the information into the computer and do their contract with one of the carriers Walmart was able to contract phones with such as ATT. I learned that if you work hard and put the customer first customers will appreciate you and your expertise. I had customers who would only come to my Walmart to deal with me if they could help it. Management was a mixed bag sometimes you were dealing with great leaders who cared about their associates, and customers. They were lead from the front individuals who worked right beside you not afraid to get their hands dirty.. Then you also had people who only micromanaged everything from afar. At times it seemed factions of management would form against each other causing morale and fragmentation among associates. Walmart used to feel like a family, and I was proud to be there. Hardest part of the job was getting hardly any shift coverage in a high traffic department. In Wireless which was inside Electronics we had a lot of customer traffic. Management would try to run this area with as few associates as possible which caused a lot of stress on customers, and associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help customers with what they needed done.. Being able to fix whatever issue or problem they had then sending them home happy."
good,"Good company to work for overall. Their focus is on saving people money, and they do that very well. It is always refreshing to hear patients talk about how much you have helped them. No matter where you work, the leaders above you set the tone for your work life. Save for a few, most all leaders were a pleasure to work with and were very clear with their goals and expectations. Positive experience."
good,I really don't have much to say about Walmart except for the fact that i dont work there as of right now and i feel like they are a good company for a reference
good,over all it was a good place it work. a lot of good people there..we had really good management and we all worked very hard .we had to park a little far from the front and if we worked late we had to walk into the dark part of the parking lot to get in our cars but we usually got ff when we were suppose to.
good,"It was very laid back place, people were nice, they would answer questions at anytime you need them to and did a lot of training on computer which was good then you worked at your own pace."
good,I had only intended to work at Walmart for a few months while looking for a better position. The place was decent to work for but there were few opportunities for advancement because those who had already advanced were staying in their positions for a long time. The management was good and they follow strict rules regarding lunches and breaks to make sure everyone gets what they are due.
good,"This is not really a bad place to work, but you must expect to work hard and most weekends and holidays. Dealing with the public can sometimes be difficult, but if you smile and be friendly you can do well. Meeting new people can be fun, and if you like children you can expect to see quite a few and they are so cute! It is important to stay busy (which isn't usually hard to do), and always keep a smile on your face."
good,"Very nice place to work with friendly coworkers and customers, never a day bad at Wal-Mart. I learned so much and would love to find a Wal-Mart closer to my home"
good,"Open register, restock bags, order change, replace receipt tape, scan customer purchases, bag customer purchases, put away go backs, answer customer questions, process credit card applications/payments. The management was really friendly and really great to work with. My co-workers were really supportive and did not want to see you fail. The hardest part of the job was assisting rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was giving back to my community by serving customer needs."
good,Work was fast paced productive but doable along with friendly staff but the management ruin the experience. Employees are not respected by business decisions and are quickly thrown under the bus. Rapid schedule changes and tedious tasks given to the older employees it harder for long time employees as an attempt to swap them for the new less earning new hires.
good,i worked as a technician doing oil changes in the middle of the summer. even though there is a roof over your head it gets hot not only the outside but also when you are facing an engine that was just running at a very high temperature. I don't believe they should pay a bit more for technicians do to the type of work that is being done.
good,Walmart was my first actual job when i was younger and I learned a lot when I worked there. I grew up into an adult and became a stable person into today's society.
good,"The hire you get through the hiring process, the harder it is to move up. Great place to meet new people. They put time and effort into you to grow and learn new things"
good,"Great place to work where your achievements are valued. Corporate culture is focused on the employee's needs first, then the company. I would strongly recommend."
good,A busy fast pace job.  great place to work at.  Only hard part about working is the heat in the summer time.  other then that.  management is ok and i say that because nothing is perfect.
good,"Abilities for advancement are unlimited regardless of education or background. If you are willing to train and work diligently, you can advance and have a secure future."
good,Great company with various job opportunities and provides promotions of choice. They are a family oriental company provides great customer service. I love working for Walmart.
good,"It made your time go by super fast. You were always on the move, never a break to catch a breather. You always wanted to make sure the customers were in and out."
good,Productive and lerning working place; the most enjoyable part of the job is helping consumers.  I enjoy cupcakes and cakes decoration and bakery job en general.
good,"A typical work day at Walmart can be challenging at times just like any other job. Over my 5 years I've learned a lot. I've learned how to become more of a team player. I've learned how to drive issues and getting them resolve in a timely manner without effecting any  employees productions. Management could is my department is great. The hardest part of my job at first was driving issues in a timely manner, but I've manage that part. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the people of Walmart."
good,"The stock position is physically demanding, requiring lifting, carrying, use of ladders, etc. Requires no education, but common sense is a plus. Co-workers are great and easy to get along with."
good,"Fast pace, multitask I learned patience. Management is okay, it can be a little better. The workplace culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is attending to rude and angry customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the multiple jobs I have to do ant serving the customers."
good,"This job is okay if you want steady hours, they accommodate students and work around your schedule sometimes. typically nice staff, expect not to work in the department that you were originally hired into."
good,Walmart overall is not a bad place to work. As long as you have a decent attitude and end up with a decent manager than itll be a great place to work.
good,"Un trabajo de 8 horas bueno no tan desgastante comodo"
good,there's room for to grow and improve. management.. a typical dat at work.. what you learned.. the hardest part of the job.. the most enjoyable part of the job..
good,They are a good company to work for but the hourly wage needs to be hire for all employees. Some of the department managers were giving a work load more than a employee can handle.
good,"I enjoyed the customer service aspect of my job.  It gave me great delight to interact with the customers and my co-workers.    Unfortunately, management could do better in being prepared, organized and transparent.  When there's no communication things can become chaotic."
good,While working at Wal-Mart I advance quickly into several positions of interest.  Anyone looking for a profession in retail would be greatly rewarded with a competitive salary.
good,"Slow paced in morning, understaffed. CSM""s be more active in their role. Advancement available if career in retail is what you are looking for. Most part Management is friendly willing to assist you when needed. Can be a fun work place. Laid back atmosphere. Does get busy during holidays and storms. Just trying to stay busy when working front end  in  mornings is challenge."
good,I loved working at Walmart. It's a fun environment. the pay is great. the friends you make are forever. I would absolutely go back to work at Walmart 100%.
good,"Worked on cars doing oil changes, tire changes and retail sales.  Supervised employees in Tire and Lube Department.  Resolved problems with angry customers.  Processed new inventory and directed stock storage or display on floor. "
good,"There is no ""typical day"" at Wal-Mart. There are procedures and processes that happen at various times. This is a retail environment that deals with many levels of customers on a constant basis. Then there are all of the exceptions to the rule that seem to pop up at various times. Overall company leadership is good and supportive. The company is very technology based and is constantly evolving to meet the needs of today and tomorrow's customers."
good,"A comfortable environment, laid back and stress-free. Good management hours were acceptable pay was ok but certain departments were unorganized. Other than that it was a good job."
good,"Great temporary job for someone in school, I learned how wal-mart system works, management was cool as long as u did what u were supposed to do. I enjoyed the benefits but the hardest part of my job was getting off on time."
good,"Working as an Representative was a pleasurable encounter, Waking up almost everyday looking forward to going to work. The people there were exceptional which made my job much more settle. My year and a half there, I learned how to become a reliable team-player and I also gain the knowledge and understanding of what the company needs in order to be successful."
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar, mas de difícil evolução, pois raramente alguém que já está dentro da empresa é promovido. Eles preferem contrarar alguém de fora."
good,There is a potential to promote and climb the ladder within the company if you are willing to be cross trained and learn roles in other areas and departments of the store.
good,"If you enjoy a high paced high pressure environment, then this is the company for you. There are many great people from all walks of life that you get the opportunity to learn from."
good,Walmart was a stable place/environment to work. I started as a cashier and worked my way up to a Customer Service Manager within in two years of being there. I have worked graveyard and morning/evening shifts and am comfortable with either.
good,Great advancement opportunity with a growing company.  Hardest part is retail business with no holiday time with family. The only day of the year they are closed is Christmas Day.
good,"First, I unload trucks, organize the equipment by department. After, I take the equipment out to the sales floor and stock the shelves. In between I greet customers and help them find anything they are struggling to find. I've learned to interact more with people and how to work at a fast but organized pace. My management communicates poorly with their employees but will communicate with  other managers.. It started out good but over time things started to fall apart. Such as neatness, communication errors, and lack of staff. I really enjoy working with the little team I do have and interacting with friendly customers."
good,Walmat provides great and competitive working environment and great health package but need to improve upon the hourly pay for their associates. That will be one area to consider for improvement
good,"I liked this job, but I would say that I wasn't just in electronic I was all over the store.  Wherever people were need I had to be able to fill in at any given moment."
good,Depending on Store manager and Market manager Walmart can be a very satisfying career.  The company allows plenty of support staff hours. The primary focus is moving to a clinical service and patient compliance model.  As a whole a Pharmacist is able to utilize his / her clinical skills.
good,If you like retail Walmart is the best place to work if you like big challenges.  There is a great amount of room for growth and advancement. The only reason I am considering other options is I want to be home for the holidays and want to spend more time with my kids
good,"You are there to work and get the product on the shelves for the customers to buy. There is a lot of pressure to get  your work completed, while at the same time help the customer find what they want. Sometimes these two aspects of the job are in conflict, but the customer always comes first."
good,Walmart is a great place to work with many benifits. Although sometimes you end up with people who are hard to work for. I have worked for Walmart 3 times and the first two were great the last time was a joke.
good,Good for a first job and pay is good. Friendly coworkers and customers. Diverse company and always keeps you on your feet. Also get benefits while working at this establishment.
good,"Great place to work, you make a ton of money but you definitely work for it. I worked overnights and you basically don't have a social life because all you do is work and sleep but definitely worth it"
good,"I think that where you work is a part of your life that should be looked forward to everyday.  Good leadership is EVERYTHING!"
good,Es un trabajo bajo presión lo que lo hace un poco difícil
good,This was my first real job. it was ok at the beginning but then it got old. to many rules changed day to day.  its a good place to have a 2nd income. or a starter job.
good,"Good pay no benefits would be a downfall for the company. I worked there hoping to move up ib the cimpqny after a ehile but it does not work like that. Basicqlly, its a who you know type of situation"
good,"Walmart offers many different opportunities in career advancement, social opportunities, and overtime. I enjoy wokinng at Walmart it allows me to hone my work skill and better myself."
good,Walmart is a fast paced work environment. I loved working there. The managers always worked with me to ensure that I was happy in my job. I would love to work there again.
good,Establecerme laboralmente en un trabajo y experimentarme dentro del rubro laboral.
good,"overall great place to work. My management was great, but the store manager never helped are section of the store. Always had something bad to say about are department. Didn't help that are department was undermanned and she would not hire more staff for are area."
good,The people were fun to work with. The job is fast paced and interesting. You learn how to do several different jobs. You learn how to manage a team of employees. Their business training program was excellent. Opportunities for advancement and to some extent travel. Salaried based management often do not get compensated for working past 40 hours. The pay could be better for the amount of work you are expected to do. Better stock options could be offered to their employees.Wal-Mart was always cutting back on employee hours to save money often at the expense of customer service. Need to put more value in their employees.
good,"The job is easy and relaxed, there isn't an overbearing or overtaxing amount of work. Associates are treated fairly and schedules are worked to meet needs and demand. A typical day at work had me working in two hour intervals with breaks thrown in equally throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was learning the layout of the store and reading the UPCs to ensure that things were placed in the proper areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all the new holiday and seasonal freight come in. Working here was like working with family."
good,"The environment is great !! They pay is usually good!! Customers are for the most part very friendly, the 10 ft rule is great! Working with various people helps with customer service skills."
good,"A typical day at walmart is very fast paced.  You will never suffer from boredom that is for sure.  If not serving a customer, there is plenty of stocking and cleaning to do."
good,"I loved working for Walmart, love the customers, got along well with the other employees team work. The benefits were great, I would of never left but I encountered a bad Manager."
good,"While it is very easy to make friends here with co-workers and management, management tends to be down your throat about getting your job done even if you are clearly doing your job."
good,i worked in the tire and lube express there and it was a fun place to work with some very good people it was hard work but everyone was willing to help each other out
good,"Great place if you have the right management. Be careful to trust but verify. If you are looking for quick advancement, you must network yourself. It is a competitive market"
good,"I started as a night stocker, and did well.  One of the managers I dealt with often mistook my monotone voice as a negative attitude.  I switched to day shift to get away from him and his condescending attitude.  Otherwise it was a good place to work with nice people."
good,"It is a great job where your will like family with your coworkers. While there tend to be favorites and moving up depending to much on being friendly and schmozing than those who had the job performance, or experience for the job. I would recommend the job because of polices in place that protect the workers. Such as extra breaks,"
good,"The management I was working with at the time was very hard to work with, she didn't really listen to anyone unless you were friends with her. Other than her and a few other people in her circle, I love working there."
good,to me honestly  I think that Walmart is a beautiful clean environment with working dedicated people and some of the best customers around the world. if I can I will work again for the company.
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, enjoyed the wonderful co workers and management. I would really love to work for Wal-Mart again. It's a good job and I love to be a sales associate."
good,"not a normal persons job. you had to be in shape to do my job. on a daily basis 9-16 tons was lifted be hand. didnt learn much from them that i didnt already know,"
good,Slow paced standing still in one spot job. Overall it was okay but i like fast paced. The managent was not that great. Took forever to get anything accomplished
good,The management team needed a little work but overall it was a good place to work. I enjoyed some of my coworkers. The pay was good at the time and my work hours were satisfactory.
good,I really enjoy working there with my customers employees . I serve customers as they needed. Basically serving customers service needs. Working with people is very exciting.
good,"I enjoyed working here. Cap 2 team we unloaded the semis in back and stocked the shelves. From semi to correct cart isle location, was fast paced, do to limited amout of time we had to have the truck unloaded. From there the stocking on the floor was laid back and fun. The Emplyees i worked qith were fun understanding and great to work with."
good,"There is a nightly meeting that overnight associates attend where you learn your assigned area. After you are assigned in a department, you stock the freight on the sales floor or pull carts/pallets from the backroom to stock. You must zone and rotate your stock after you completed your freight unless otherwise instructed. Management is fairly laid back as long as you show effort and complete your assigned duties in a fair amount of time. The hardest part of the job is on heavier truck nights when staff is short and requires extra effort and sometimes a little too much is expected. There doesn't seem to be much room for advancement and they prefer you to stay in an area that you are proficient at. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is definitely customer service as it is rewarding to make customers happy."
good,"basically cleaning restrooms, emptying big trash and register trash, sweeping big floors and do what management and what CSM says, the most enjoyable part of working there was the other associates"
good,"I would work so hard, to make sure everything was getting done before the end of my shift, just for my coworker to be on her phone looking at facebook. I learned to keep to myself and work hard. Don't worry about anyone else, just yourself. The most enjoyable part of this job was the friendly coworkers(For the most part)"
good,"The Walmart that I work at could definitely use some better managers. I feel if they hire you for a certain job, you should be able to do it and not have to do someone else's job."
good,"The cliantele varies but overall its quite a social job. the hours can some times ba a hassle, for example woking a late night and having to start the next shift early in the morning"
good,"encouraging management, low stress, great advancement opportunities, good benefits and vacation time, fair job/life balance, work a lot of weekends, great team building job"
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced."
good,"My job wasn't hard, but not easy when your being asked to be in two different places at once, management needs work, not communicating well with my supervisors up front. Not many happy employees, retail needs to improve from an employer stand point."
good,Walmarrt has GREAT advancement opportunities but terrible management the store manger and most of the assistant and Co managers dont know how to talk to the workers and nun of the support managers do there job they only walk around and create work for some one else to do. Like if you work Electronics and you're area is real busy they will pull you to another area then write you up when you dont finish your mods
good,Wal-mart is an okay company to work for. If you like a fast pace work environment. They will work around your schedule. Over all it is a good place to start working for if you have never had a job before
good,Working at Walmart is pleasant. Walmart has allowed me to pay my bills and live comfortably for years. I am at a point in my life where i want to work with dedicated professionals. I am tired of mediocrity and apathetic employees.
good,We came in and got busy with task of balancing he room and deposits.  Wrapping change and making deposits. No problems with management.  I really enjoyed the time I worked there.
good,Walmart is a job were i would be able to grow and benefits work well with my family. Hardest part of the job was the hours I was not receiving enough hours. The best part is making the customer happy.
good,The associates i worked with were awesome. It was a fun work place with a lot of hard workers. The management needs help though. there is a lot of lazy managers who need to learn to take control.
good,"Walmart was a overall good place to work.I liked everyone I worked with , I enjoyed working with the general public. They paid good and had competive pay."
good,"Tudo na empresa era pra ontem. Ótimo ambiente de trabalho.Tínhamos liberdade para fazermos ações no setor, desde que chegássemos as metas estabelecidas.Tínhamos total apoio do RH, a política da empresa funcionava."
good,"Typical night for me at Bridgeton nj Wall-Mart would me making shore i have all of my new working pallets out on the floor as well as old pallets of overstock,i gather my clothing carts,start to break down my pallets and separate the clothing by departments after that i would often check other departments for stock that may of got mixed up while being shipped to the store..after new stock has been broken down and separated i begin to break my old pallets and stock off of those if needed..The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pallets coming in just so you would not have extra pallets of work the next night..The easiest part was me finally being able to keep up with my work and get done at the time my shift is over.I also had lovely CoWorkers that made my job better by encouraging me to do my best"
good,Wal-mart was fun because of the customers they made coming to work good because we experienced something different everyday. Customer service was always our number one priority.
good,"Hay mucha gente, por lo tanto hay mucho trabajo, sobre todo por las tardes"
good,"Working in the electronics department is pretty chill and can easily become boring if you don't find something to do. Other than that, your typical day involves upkeeping electronics, movies and video game displays, sweeping the floor and running the cash register."
good,"Walmart is a good job for high school or college students. They give you a lot of hours, the pay just isn't enough to live off of with kids and bills. If you don't have kids you'll be just fine though."
good,"I greet customers with a friendly greeting I deal with many different types of personalities as a cashier, I remain calm and handle the situation to the best of my knowledge. I also work at a fast pace and adapt easily to change, I work with cash handling and giving or receiving  correct change most enjoyable part of the job is when I have regular customers come through my line and specifically look for me to cash them out."
good,"I have no problems with my employment with Walmart. I received great hours and I was treated well by all management. If I wasn't so over-qualified for the position, I could see myself there for a long term employment."
good,"The job can be very difficult at times, but overall is a pleasant place to work. The management team can be very demanding , but they are also very cooperative with associates."
good,I build long time friendship and learned a lot of skills. Some of the  managers will work  with you to ensure success  and keep the customers smiling.
good,Competitive work environment w/ little room to advance. The work day is fairly long but the pay is worth the time. A lot of people to work with so new friends are made daily.
good,"This was a second job, I worked in the jewelry department. The most enjoyed part of the job was helping people pick out wedding rings, or Christmas gifts for wives and girlfriends.  Hardest part of the job was standing behind the counter waiting for another customers."
good,"go check to see what bikes may be built.pull bikes to be built,and check for other things to be built for day.then help set up for incomming truck to be unloaded and help crew unload"
good,The job is very demanding. At time it almost seemed impossible to meet the requirements of the responsibilities.  I loved the jo itself until I became department manager. As long as you do the est you cant. you will have great opportunity. This is a jo for a person who can meet the high performance stress.
good,"It was a comfortable place to work and the employees were friendly.  It was a great place to meet new people and learn from them. "
good,"a typical day at walmart was cashing checks,  paying bills, returning items and checking customers out with their goods. "
good,"Ambiente agradavel,aprendi a interagir mais com clientes a parte dificil do trabalho é a atenção para as atividades pois eu trabalhei na area de pereciveis a parte agradável são os companheiros e a chefia que atenderam as minhas expectativas."
good,I enjoyed working their the atmosphere was good. Supervisors treated me with respect and ask my opinion about things. Our work schedules were always posted in a timely manner.
good,"Very diverse and a nice place to work at.  I didn't work for a long time because I had to leave due to relocation but the time I worked, I had a great experience."
good,"Nice place to work, Nice people, Although I do not believe the compensation is fair for the job that is asked. Hardest part of the job is the customer demands, especially on busy days, basic work tasks may no be completed. Easiest part of the day, Staying busy. There is always something that needs to be done. Most enjoyable are the people that I work with. It becomes a second family, and 99.9% are very friendly."
good,I had an overall great work experience with Wal-Mart and enjoyed my time working there. Got along well with management and other associates. The employee discount is really nice because it applies to a lot of your essential household needs.
good,"A typical day in the work place was busy but laid back. I learned how to accurately process guests money transactions in all kinds of payment form, cash, debit/credit cards, vouchers and gift cards. Management team really didn't work together that well. There were the ones that worked very hard and then you had your slackers. The hardest part of my job was I worked really hard in the workplace and overtime and was always on time. However, when I lost child care they were not able to work with my schedule."
good,There was plenty of room for advancement within the company. They offered classes to improve your skills and education as well. Not a bad place to work.
good,Its a good place to get yourself up and running for your independence. But it's not a place that you want to permanently stay employed with for too long or you'll be stuck.
good,I cleaned and stripped and wax the floors . My coworkers were great . The best part of my job is completing my task and getting a thumbs up from management
good,This company has great benefits but the way the manager treats her associates not good. She gives your one task to do and before you turn around she is saying are you done yet.
good,"Decent pay, management will work with you on your schedule, the Paid Time Off program they have feels fair, and the benefits were very competitive. I would say the two places my store needed to improve on was properly staffing the store at all times and having more communication between staff and management, as we occasionally got conflicting orders. Overall though, a good company to work for."
good,"Empresa diversifica, onde aprimorei meus conhecimentos em  instalações de redes de combate a incêndio, elaboração de laudos técnicos, coordenação de equipes, manutenção e execução de obras de prevenção para liberação de AVCB e serviços de manutenção prediais."
good,J aimais bien travailler pour la compagnie mais je ne me sens pas apprécié a ma juste valeur au plaisir de vous rencontrer
good,I received my biggest amount of work experience just from working for his one company. There are several different types of jobs available to transfer to or learn about so I was able to learn different jobs and acquire many new skills and experience multiple working environments
good,I  had fun meeting new people from other places got different stuff for helping the passangers made good tips got to relax once in a while because of the flights
good,I hear a lot of people complain about walmart but my walmart was actually enjoyable because the people that work there are amazing. It really did feel like a second family while working there.
good,Walmart can be very demanding. Walmart are  generally  very busy and almost always have lines customers can be rude at times.a good place to work when your young and need hours
good,Walmart serves as a great company that support many employees who love to work and help make everyone else days easier. I enjoyed working at Walmart I had good friends and co-workers and it wasn't a hard job.
good,"Lots of work in a hot enviorment, too much turn over with associates, not very good training program, pay is too low, to really earn a living, considering the amount of money Wal-Mart makes"
good,"Great place to learn as a first job, however the management doesn't necessarily give pay raises to the hardest workers, but rather the ones who are good at networking with them (life lesson here. This applies to a lot of jobs). Keep a positive attitude and there is great opportunity for growth if you voice your opinion."
good,I enjoyed working for walmart. Walmart offers lots of advancements. If you get full time you are offered benefits. They have programs for all kinds of help if you need it.
good,"Good place to work, good learning and advancement opportunities if you are flexible regarding work timings. People are great to work with at least at the location I worked for (Ontario). I had wonderful managers, I enjoyed working with each and everyone of them. Learnt a lot from my immediate manager and my Store Manager. Both are great guys."
good,I enjoyed my position at Walmart a lot. The job was very organized and it was easy to catch on. If I had to choose a previous job to go back to this would be the one.
good,There are many job opportunities and chances to move up in Walmart. They are flexible with your schooling schedule or need to change to a different shift or department.
good,"Walmart is nice for someone who just needs any job, or is young in the market needing something to gain experience in the work environment until they find their calling. there isnt much room for real worthwhile advancement unless you plan to make walmart your life."
good,"the work is no problem and the training is even easier. The only problem encountered was with my co-workers and my superiors, but that's anywhere you go other than that excellent place to work."
good,"I enjoyed this job. There was room for advancement and I got challenged. The only problem I had was management expected you to do your job properly, of course, but most if the time couldn't tell you the proper way to do it. Management was uninformed in so many things."
good,Awesome job. Wish i could have stayed working there but as with all great things it eventually had to come to an end. I loved meeting new people coming from all over.
good,"You have the chance to work with some really nice people. Most of the co workers will do their best to help you out. You could also have the chance to get benefits such as health, dental and eye. They have a good department pay rate."
good,"Great job to have, exceptional benefits and great pay. Full time employees get their promised 36+ hours a week and possibly more plus overtime if needed. Part time employees mostly work as full time if working over nights. Not many Daytime hours unless full time."
good,"Stock shelves with product check expiration dates when needed.    Most of the management personal was easy to talk to."
good,Not a bad job for someone who can move up into management and beyond or good for making some extra cash but not enough to support yourself or a family on.
good,Walmart is a really nice place. I really appreciate your support. You guys have really good clothes. I love the way you support us. You guys hay good sense of stile. You guys are nice super nice. I buy almost everything I need for cooking. The store smells so nice. Thank You for supporting us Walmart & being. I love you guys. I love the way you love us. I love your julery. I like your food. I love your bedding.
good,"Management is average depending on what department you work in and who the manager is. Work environment is dependent where you are working. Scheduling depends on what manager you have, some will work with you others will try to schedule you by yourself."
good,Working for wal mart is fast paced and is mostly fun depending on who you work with. It can be stressful at times but they pay pretty well. They work with yoy for family matters if you need off.
good,"unloading truck and organizing food from carts. I learned where everything goes in walmart, management was poor. workplace was fun people were fun to work with, the hardest part was unloading the truck, most enjoyable part was working with great people."
good,"Typical Day at my level is performing various business functions, or finishing up projects or presentations and attending meetings. They don't discourage doing things on your own and making mistakes is fine as long as your manager can see the logic. I like that about this place. You get a chance to work with a ton of people and typically they are very helpful."
good,i didn't like the fact that you had to stand at the doors. And i also i didn't like that they couldnt keep enough cashier. I did like team time zone though
good,I love Walmart most of the time I am seeking a management position. and am having trouble advancing. I work night and am seeking days. I also don't get to interact with all the customers.
good,The training for the pharmacy needs to be improved such as you should go to a training class for at least two weeks especially when you are new to pharmacy work not just be thrown to the wolves and basically teaching yourself. But overall I do like working for the company.
good,"Over see cashiers, customer service desk, customer satisfaction, online orders, etc. "
good,"Working for walmart you have to be on top of your. Game a balanced work place  but things have to be done. Managers well mannered  love to help. Be a leader of yourself protect your work place, show great team support  , always friendly to customers, show that you are there to work , help the community save better , live better ,"
good,I enjoyed the honest paying work and the tasks were generally along the same lines day in and day out. I could be sent to do other tasks if there is some downtime or if we are overstaffed. I'd do it again if I could as the people around was what made the job worth coming back to.
good,I enjoyed my job in the pharmacy while I was there...my managers were fair.  I enjoyed my co-workers.  The discounts were fair and had an employee day at Christmas for and extra discount
good,"Worked as a cashier. Scan items, Process customers' payments, Adhere to all safety policies and procedures. Must be extremely patient with customers. Must get a credit app from customers everyday."
good,I liked working for walmart it was fun and always had something different to do. Had to give up my job due to the sytems being upgraded in Arizona and Indiana couldn’t accept my transfer due to changes in their system.
good,go in to work first thing is to clean up the back of building and get rid of pallets from the night before stacking them fifteen high when done report to my department to start putting  frieght  on shelves and making sure department is zoned and free of items that are not in the department.atend morning meetings with the store manager
good,"Buen ambiente Laboral, con una temporada alta de volumen de mercancía por procesar, fomentando el trabajo en equipo para el logro de las compañía."
good,"Unloading tucks, sorting product, and getting it ready to be put out onto the shelves. Management wasn't too bad usually they were busy with other t hings but if you found one you could ask a question and get it answered really quick. Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and sorting the product out. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk and interact with customers."
good,This is a different place to work that is very stern with their employees. This job was fun but also demanding. It takes special kind of people to work here and care about what they do.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, pago de horas extra y estabilidad laboral"
good,"Sin duda alguna es una excelente empresa donde uno puede crecer. Podría parecer un trabajo sencillo pero realmente cada quien aporta mucho para sacar adelante el día ahí."
good,"This was my very first job, I remained there throughout my three years as a high school student. The store manager is exceptional in every way possible. Very kind, very encouraging, and very active in his store - always went out of his way to check in with you and have a genuine conversation. Retail was an excellent way to learn how to deal with customers professionally, as well as learn to be punctual, reliable, and a good team player."
good,this was a decent job to have gave me enough hours to pay for school and also were willing to work with my schedule people there were great and seemed more like a family than co workers
good,"A typical Day at work is what you make of it. At these few places I learned that no matter what any one says or does to always continue to stay positive. Management at these few places was pretty decent. The work place culture has always changed in the few places I have worked. There was no hard parts about Wal-Mart or McDonald's, But at Fed-Ex although the pay was good it required extreme lifting. I would say that would be the hardest part . The most enjoyable part of any job that I have is with my co-workers and my customers because talking & joking are both fun I enjoy to do so."
good,"Walmart is a great place to build your resume, build work history and experience, and to grow within the company as a possible career. Walmart is dynamic in their passive sales to keep the image of ""Always Changing"" by relocating products, reintroducing old products, and always preparing for the major holidays. Great Job security if you just need an income to get by for a short period."
good,"its a place where you can learn and move up, if you know the right person to help you move up. This company goes beyond the health standards for the quality of the products. They have a concerned about safety practices."
good,"Walmart was a nice place to work,I worked overnight cleaning the floors Bathrooms and where the registers were, waxed and moped the floors"
good,Same as before. It's a same Company before 2002 it was only Walmart then after they change it to Walmart Super Center. I learn a lot about Customer service and teller work. i start my job as Cashier then promoted for Customer Service associate and after that i become a part of management and work as a Department/ Merchandise manager.
good,Under staff not enough help and manager doesn't seem to care. When you talk to supervisor they don't get back to you right away. I feel they don't really care
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work, it pays more than most retail, and grocery stores. one of my biggest dislikes was their theft policy. they do seem to care about their customers more than their employees."
good,The pharmacy workflow is designed well. Pharmacist get to focus on patient care while technicians get to focus on their own functions. Pharmacists always gets a lunch break which is nice.
good,"Ok environment"
good,"Very fast paced. I kind of felt like the old management took the time to properly train new associates. Otherwise, still a good position. Must be able to be fast paced and lift, bend frequently."
good,"Depending on the location, the days will be tough. It has its perks, but it also has its downfalls. It can not be explained, rather it must be experienced."
good,"Além do trabalho comum de caixa deve-se fazer alguns trabalho a mais relacionados a organização do caixa, há problemas relacionados a quebra de caixa incluindo o fato de que se houver necessidade de se ausentar colocam outra pessoa no lugar sem mudar o usuário ou conferir o dinheiro do caixa."
good,"I enjoy my Time working for Walmart "
good,A great place to work overall but you must be aware of your actions and words at ALL times. People can take anything as offensive there and use that to their own advantage.
good,The best part of working at Walmart is being able to take off when I need to for family obligations. I average 6 hours per week in paid time off earned.
good,This job has had its up and downs but through all and all i can say i did a great job while working there. My favorite part about this job was the people i have met there and how different every one was and how helpful they were.
good,"Stable employment, good benefits, good co-workers. Boring and repetitive work, but overall experience was good. Didn't have any issues whatsoever with anyone."
good,Wal-Mart can be a good company to work for. The hours are fairly flexible and the pay is decent. They offer great benefits to employees. A good management team is key to a good experience while working for Wal-Mart.
good,very fast pase place to work had to know the hold brack room and were everthing was to be place sand know what number the item go  a wordy was go and this strat unload the truck the work place were like a family the hard part the job was get the truck done at a in a hour half the most enjoyable part the job is that we alway help each other no matter what we was face like if we were short handle we all help to get it done
good,"It was a great place to work, but i can honestly say, it wasn't  for everybody.  i would recommend the job to a friend,  and they have great benefits."
good,"A typical day the company that i worked for would be helping, socializing with lot of people, i leader that working this company you have to be flexible, management i think could do better at fixing thing and working together."
good,So welcoming company good Associates very healthful workplace always willing to help customers as well and Associates when needed able to provide me with the daily things I need to do the job at hand
good,"I'm a cashier. I walk in clock on get on the register and process payments,provide best good friendly service to customers. I wish managers was more professional and more nicer to cashiers, when they help they be sometimes with attitudes"
good,"Goal oriented workplace with and emphasis on processes.  The best part of the company is that it has unlimited possibilities for advancement.  Like in all workplaces, co-workers can determine how happy you are at the job."
good,"A typical day of work consists of walking the store an ensuring general controls are in place. Ensuring that hazardous waste and compliance is up to standard on a daily basis. Working reports, identifying shrink or potential shrink opportunities. I've learned a great deal over the years from my everyday job duties and responsibilities. Working side by side with both management and hourly associates alike is a big upside, especially when it comes to the teaching and training aspect of the business. The most difficult part of the job is to maintain my everyday job functions as well as being needed and pulled to other stores in the market to help out, but still maintain my job duties at my home store. What I enjoy most is teaching and training associates and getting the best out of them and seeing them get promoted and prosper."
good,Trabajar en la empresa es divertido y de amplio conocimiento aprendes rápido y te sientes seguro al desempeñar tu trabajo
good,I have worked in two different areas of the business. One within the office and one on the sales floor. There is room to grow within the company and to be promoted from within.
good,I've worked here for 9 years. They have worked with me as much as possible. I have been trained in a few areas to help out when needed. Always will to learn new things
good,Traditional brick and mortar retailer with designs at becoming a major e-commerce player.  Walmart culture is integrated into everything at the home office (all meetings begin with the walmart or Sam's cheer) and understanding that culture is a key to success.
good,"Every day was different. I had minimum supervision, which I enjoyed  interacted with customers on a daily basis............................................"
good,"This is a good starting place, I would not plan on making a career here. Use it to enhance you skills as a stepping stone to another company to gain more experience and knowledge."
good,This was a good job if you working to grow with the company. The hardest part about working for this job is basically the area in which the store was located. This made it an easy target for shoplifters and we had to keep an eye out all the time.
good,Work in general never had a slow moment. Working hands on was a daily part of the job and management always had new work for you. Willingness to learn is a must in this type of landscape. The management itself was very helpful and a group of good people. The general culture of Walmart is to provide fast and friendly service and this is what I had always strive for. The job did have it's up and downs but the hardest part was definitely the unpredictable nature of it. Such as previously mentioned being able to think on your toes is a must and it can be difficult at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my past coworkers and customers and becoming their friends and making that connection with them in the work place.
good,"I liked working at Walmart but to be honest, I will never work there ever again. It's just not what I want in an job/career. There was too much drama when I was just trying to focus on my work and also they were very unorganized."
good,Working at Walmart wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Management worked hard to maintain the store and sales. The culture was something I looked forward to going into work. Employees got along just fine. I learned a lot from working at Walmart and being that it was my first job ever.
good,"Nice people when beginning the day.for the past 11 months of me working at Walmart I have learned so much more then I have ever did before which is great. Management is very nice they well try to help you as much as possible. My workplace culture is very claim,everyone works great together.the hardest part of my job isn't really much at all I can do everything all fine.The most enjoyable part of my job is basically being able to communicate with my co-workers and doing what I do best at my job."
good,"Nothing terribly special, or notably awful. Go to work, sort stock, help customers and go home. The pay is fair, you just have to do the work. They're pretty lenient, though."
good,"I love my job at Walmart,being a cashier and meet all of the customer  from different walks of life. My co workers are really nice plus the culturally diversity that you can learn from your coworkers is pretty cool."
good,"uma ótima  empresa com muitos benefícios,  porém com poucas pessoas para fazer  o melhor para empresa"
good,"Walmart is a fast paced environment, with nearly unlimited potential for growth and advancement within its stores. There are options for transfers to other stores, so relocating within the company is a huge benefit."
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 4 years and I love it. The only thing I have bad to say is, it takes a while to see good money from walmart. And it's always Good to sign up for their benefits."
good,Very friendly atmosphere.  Lots of work to be completed by the end of the night.  Management was 80% good.  Most enjoyable part of my day was my coworkers.
good,Good work environment. Has opportunity to move up in company. Teach train is a motivated professional development that helps motivate associates.  To always give customers best service.
good,Probaly the best over the road truck driving company for pay & not having to stay out weeks at a time. Many drops & hooks daily. Sleeping each night in sleeper was the hardest part of the day. Some places didn't seem very safe.
good,relatively easy going work experience. I don't have anything bad to say about Walmart they put who they need where they need them. The company in a whole is a place I would recommend anybody to work for.
good,"As all the back end processes were based on Walmart culture so the store operations were run in absolute disciplined manner."
good,Started out as a Bake/Cake Decorator in the Portsmouth location and had a very positive experience in all categories. After having my daughter I switched to the Seabrook location to do third shift because it accommodated my parenting schedule and compensation needs that had recently changed. I had a bad experience with sexist discrimination by management and favoritism after the switch.
good,"Wal mart was good to work at for someone who is just beginning their work career.   Good benefits, good hours...but sorry management. Cahier job was to stressful for me, but at the same time it was also enjoyable.  Meet some really neat people."
good,Not bad at all for a retail job. They treat everyone pretty fairly and are pretty open to moving people around who aren't happy where they are. I would work here again if needed.
good,"Overall Walmart is a good place to work, they give you benefits, the pay of fair, & SOME of them manangers really help you when needed. The only downside is some of the managers were no help whatsoever."
good,"The overall job was good. You deal with rude customers which is typical, its retail. Black Friday was fun to work. Management was decent, pay could be a little higher for department managers."
good,"The managers are all nice. They tend to be a little slow, but everything gets done."
good,l ambiance appris de nouvelle facon de travailler dans de bonne condition
good,"love working for Wal-Mart, "
good,i love working. i been working for walmart almost 8 years. i was a cashier at first than moved on to customer service. i been dealing with bad and good customer. i love helping clients.
good,Es buena empresa pero aveces las personas con altos cargos que trabajan ahí dificultan un poco el proceso de trabajo
good,"The job pays great, but theres days where you have to work harder than other days, due to amount of work. But overall is a great, fair job, and their willing to work with you."
good,Wal-Mart is a more diverse job . A lot more possibility to what you can do for that company . Many advancement possibilities . If you treat them well they treat you better.
good,"A big thing for me has always been knowing where you should be in you're job and working there it was always clearly laid out that you should be doing this task at this time, and done by this time so you can move onto the next task. Management was always willing to work with you to help out any kinds of problems from work issues to out of work problems staff was always very friendly and kind to other associates and customers."
good,"You can make whatever you want of this company. Just like most jobs, it's just a matter of how what kind of work life balance you want. Most managers start as hourly. That's not just something they say. Managers can make very good money. Hourly associates can also make pretty good money. Work hard, show up on time. Really not difficult."
good,"I loved the people that I work with, I just didn't like the management. It gave me a great opportunity to learn how to do new things, and make new friends."
good,"In this job I learn work in team, be responsable, hear every opinion good or bad, be patient, tell my opinion when is necessary, the culture who you feel identify."
good,It is a very enjoyable environment where people can learn a lot. hardest part of the job is when it gets too warm/ cold while you have a lot of customers to take care of.
good,"Es una supervision constante en todo el día desde, ejecución de programas de mercadeo  hasta seguridad alimentaria, personal en el piso de venta y bodegas."
good,"Understanding in home life situations,  up to 40 hours a week but no overtime. After 90 days you get a raise after you finish the computer work called pathways"
good,"You have your good days and bad days, it is stressful but always remember to keep a smile on your face and customers are always right. The hardest part of the job for me was having to deal with all guys saying women can't unload trucks, but i accomplished it and i'm very proud of myself."

good,"get load from dispatcher, inspect truck and trailer after hook up, delivered goods to various Wal-Mart stores from central Texas to Rio grand valley, and east to Corpus Christi Texas. The pay was good , but i hardly had any time off. I averaged 11to12 hours per day. The hardest part of the job was driving on Interstate 35, and at night."
good,"Great Companies"
good,"Cashier, Customer service. Set-up floor displays. Assistance in carry outs. Stocked sales floor. Water flowers. Assistance in store set-up in different city."

good,I very much so enjoyed my employment at Walmart. They treat you with respect and make you feel like you're apart of the Walmart family. I would refer anyone to work for this company.
good,"Walmart is great with dealing with different task. There's always something to do. Management lacks in communication, but they do work very hard for everything else."
good,love the company been there 2 years the I can say that working for Walmart brings a lot out of a person you can learn new things and can learn new things about yourself working at walmart
good,"i got to work in a lot of different areas , and learned about every department which made me feel good cause i knew most questions customers asked. It would get busy but everyone had their own departments to work so it was kinda easy, but always kept busy. Honestly everything was fun to learn, only difficult part was making sure merchandise didn't come up missing. I liked working clothes, it was like organizing a big closet. Management was nice, and understanding."
good,I Enjoy my timeline there ... I worked with a group of friends and management who made it fun . We also received bonus at the end of the year.. Not just management the whole store
good,"When I first started with Walmart I was a cashier, I told management that I'm very interested in moving up with the company and would appreciate their help of opening doors along the way. Couple months later I moved up to be an accountant."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work. The management is pretty good. The only down fall for working for Walmart is you have to work every single weekend.
good,"Empresa multi nacional que me proporcionou  aprendizagem é conhecimento , treinamento ,muito útil para atuar no mercado de trabalho."
good,"at the beginning of my work day i start off either n a register like the other cashiers or at the customer service desk, then about half way int the shift i'm normally asked to suit up and help run the front end. Being a customer service helper has helped a lot in some experiences, especially when it comes to helping other associates and customers."
good,Walmart is a good company.  You have to have a good attendance and be willing to do extra work to be able to move up in the company.  If you excel and do a good job there is limitless potential.
good,"Well paced work days, mostly understanding management, open door policy, and pretty rewarding. Overall a decent place to work if in need of a job quick."
good,I learned marketing fundamentals by while having the ability to work on various types of projects and businesses. Everything centered on putting the customer first.
good,The job is a fast paced environment with always something to do. I enjoy my time when I am at work. The people I work with can be nice; it is a smaller store. The pay is very rewarding.
good,"- Go there Work hard do your best"
good,"Fresh out of college I was given a lot of responsibility. Training is lackluster and work life balance could be better but overall I enjoy my job."
good,"Hardest part of the job was simply after graduating from my area of the company, speaking to managers one on one and trying to move up positions and keep progressing within the company. Honestly felt like when it came to that, no one was listening."
good,I liked talking to the customers and helping them check out. I would ask them if they found everything alright. i took cash and also gave customers change.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is massively busy. You may occasionally stumble upon rude customers, but you'll find that everywhere you go. The management is good, to an extent, but overall it's a job all the same."
good,I started as a cashier and ended up as the layaway supervisor all with in 6 months but the company decided to close their layaway department I was demoted to cashier and they wanted to cut my pay. even thou the choice to close layaway had nothing to do with me personally.
good,"I did enjoy working at Walmart, most of all I enjoyed working in the jewelry section. I loved hearing some of the stories that customers told me as they asked for my help to pick out just the right thing for their loved ones, and I loved putting away the new merchandise and looking at all of the new stuff that I could help another customer find. There were a few really great managers while I was there and some of them took the time to really get to know the other employees. The hardest part for me was the hours because you never knew what shift you were going to get, but I did love working with my coworkers."
good,"They are very flexible when it comes to ask for a day off, especially when it comes to medical appoinments.  I seem to have no problem dealing with co-workers,"
good,"If there's one thing I can say about my time at Walmart, it's that it was an experience. A common day goes simple enough, clock in, greet customers, take my breaks, and clock out. I tend to rely on my supervisors to get my breaks, assigned door, and my schedule, though we tend to clash sometimes if I feel something is not quite right. Despite this, my managers are usually willing to see my point of view, and usually we can reach a reasonable conclusion. The only challenge I faced there was getting hungry or overheating in the garden center, but these were easy to remedy when I voiced my concern. What really made the job for me was the customers and the store itself. Even if it's as simple as answering questions, stopping what seems like a shoplifter, or striking up a small conversation, there are a lot of moments that made my Walmart career enjoyable."
good,"Walmart in general is a good company to work. For an employee, they have benefits for you, discounts, and opportunity for growth."
good,Most of the time we didnt have enough cashiers anf it got really busy. I personally only worked part time but i know they do offer benefits to full time people.
good,we do the most work and get paid the least its a cool place to work if you like slave work i only took it because i needed it thats a job where you want to move up
good,I was a cashier and I loved it. I was only responsible for my register and the customers that came through my line. I was one of the fastest cashiers there at the store. I also had some great customers. They were the best. Management was outstanding on the day shift and a bit laid back on the night shift.
good,"During my time working for Wal-Mart Distribution Center, I experienced the repetitiveness of warehouse work. Also, I experienced working long shifts with decent breaks."
good,"Walmart is very fast-paced, which makes the work day go by quickly. There is always something to be done and the majority of the associates are very productive, making the fast-paced environment an enjoyable one."
good,"The one thing I like about the company. "
good,Best part of my job is working one on one with my associates while teaching and training them to be successful.  This helps with engagement and builds rapport with your associates.
good,If you like to interact with customers on a daily basis & love to work with others then this is the job for you. You will learn all about the retail business & how to provide customer service to all in need!
good,"Nice people, busy, lots of diverse merchandise. Picking set schedules is a plus. Not enough parking and the HO workers think they own you. Something you'll have to get used to is waiting forever in the check out line"
good,"El crecimiento es a muy largo plazo, los sueldos no son tan competitivos."

good,"They train me a lot everyday since I doesn't know anything.Everyday was learning.Manager was mad when the item was unfinished,not organized.People were happy when you know where the items at"

good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. It was a great job. I wouldn't have left if I wouldn't have needed to take care of my sick dad. I worked as a CAP 1 team member and my day to day job was to organize the stockroom and pull outs from the inventory.

good,"Walmart is and always will be a very fast moving environment which I like to work in, friendly faces, and a lot of outgoing and fun people to work with! I really enjoyed the experience"
good,um ótimo lugar para aqueles que almejam crescer na empresa em pouco tempo
good,"The best way to summarize Wal-Mart is that every store is completely different than another. Some stores have great environments that are fun, productive and satisfying while others are miserable, myopic and sometimes downright stupid."
good,Best thing was the bonding with co workers and how well we worked as a team when we were short handed. Upper management considered us the best team he has ever worked with and had the reputation of completing the impossible. Now some management do tend to contradict each other which would cause problems and corporate I'd argue will make poor policy changes that would hurt the entire job process. Other than that it is pretty solid place to work.
good,Great experience with customer service and team work. Always busy and in high demand of workers and help. This job gave me a lot of balance between my life and school. Such a joy working there
good,"Prevención d Pérdidas, resguardo de los asociados,del inmueble y de la mercancía,  resguardo de mercancía alto valor y de área de alto riesgo."

good,"Everyone has a story at Wal-Mart.  You can move into any role you want if you put your mind to it.  As an academy DM I will facilitate class one week and work in the store the next.  "
good,There is always something that needs to be done. I really enjoy staying busy and helping out other associates and customers. A typical day at work is usually very fast paced and busy. It can be stressful but my team and I work very well together. I wouldn't say there is much workplace culture. A lot of people just show up and receive their paycheck and leave. The most enjoyable part of my job is the team I work with directly. We operate as a unit.
good,"The deli is a fast paced place with nonstop movement and work to be done. The number of people who come and go is high, most people don't realize how much work there is to do."

good,"As a cashier you would routinely fix items on your Isle, clean your register, help customers with a smile, get lines cleared as quickly as you can, and assist supervisors where necessary."
good,Working at Wal-Mart as a customer service manager has allowed me to meet many people. I have learned how to be a great listener and resolve complaints from customers and employees. We are all different and have different views but we all have something in common which is to be heard. This position has taught me how to be compassionate and observant. Working at Wal-Mart has its rewards if you enjoy helping others.
good,"I enjoy working there, but feel that local management needs more training on how to promote and train employees and replace department managers when they are not performing as they should or have had multiple compaints against them.  I enjoy talking with the customers and helping them find an item they don't know where it is located."
good,i enjoy working with Walmart its not the best job ever but its a job the customers alone make it worth working there and at the same time they are the reason it can not be so fun Walmart as a whole is a good employer setting the minimum payment above my states minimum wadge is a good thing and moving up isn't very hard if you do your job
good,"Worked at two different locations throughout school to assist with funds. There is a lack of motivation and complacency throughout the organization, two locations were hours apart. The organizational must change to better their employee experience."
good,Job was pretty good. People would show up and not work hard causing more work for other employees. When everybody worked job went smoothly and was well worth it.
good,"Working for Walmart is an incredible opportunity. It is rich in learning experiences and diverse in staffing and customer traffic.This is a dynamic, yet physically demanding workplace. Prepare yourself for a growing environment full of opportunities for advancement and friendships that will last a lifetime!"
good,"When I worked at walmart good hours hard work managers are somewhat rude. Start work as a cashier goes to be a stockmen and help the rest of my shift customer service,  janitor, cart pusher, helped at csm and layaway manager."
good,been there for years good place to start a career great costumers and friendly co workers but management needs to treat there workers better and give out better pay
good,Wal-mart provides good career options. Training is computer based mixed with training from a supervisor that is constantly updated. Jobs provide multi tasking being able to work in different.
good,"Benefits and pay as a salary manager was great. Though I lost my job through restructuring, I still enjoyed my role and the roles I had getting there. I did find the way the layoffs and secrecy behind them was unjust and disrespectful to the staff that have worked there. Many for years. "

good,"I have worked for Walmart, as Pharmacy Tech,  for 3 years. It has been a good job. I am currently wanting to check my options to see what other opportunities are available to me."
good,Management needs major improvement. They also say they don't discriminate against pregnant women but one of the reasons I left was because I had to make a choice quit or be fired.. I let them fire me because I wasn't ready to quit but I also used up all of my sick hours due to morning sickness
good,I love working for Wal-mart. The only reason I want to leave is to find a job in the field of what I am going to school for and that's Industrial Maintenance. The people at Wal-mart are great to work for. I am only wanting to leave to follow my dreams and find a career in a field I love.
good,"I learned department manager rolls, setting mod's throwing freight pricing directing customers, working closely with different people. Walmart in a whole is not a bad company to work for, although you need flexible hours to work here."
good,I was still in school when I worked here. but still had a good time not sure how they are now. It was a good part time job to start with. The management was good also.
good,WalMart Tire(AutoCareCenter) is a challenging and exhausting work environment.  40+ automobiles daily with services ranging from oil change to tire change/rotation to customer service.  No hand holding at this job... YOU must be self motivated and eager to work.. Lots of OT is available and hard work does get rewarded with FULL TIME status quickly..

good,Muy buena empresa cuenta con excelentes prestaciones te apoyan para continuar tus estudios
good,Otima empresa aprendi muitas coisas otimas pessoas ambiente agradavel muito boa
good,"Wal-Mart in Mexico was a great place for me to work. They offered flexible schedules, they worked with you when things didn't quite go as planned. The benefits (not the pay) for the employees are wonderful. This was just an over great place to work. The only negative part was that they only paid $7.25 for you to bust your butt."
good,A typical day of work I spend most of my time assisting customers finding items that they need. I down stack meat pallets in the meat cooler. I maintain the meat wall keeping it stocked and cleaned. My management are great.
good,"A typical day at work could vary, depending on what time of year it was and if we were short staffed, which was very often. Although I loved working with the customers and being around people sometimes the job could get stressful, management changed a lot and we never had enough employees to work with us so it made the job so hard sometimes when it was non-stop busy. I learned to multi-task and how to solve most problems without having to call for a manager."
good,A good place to work. Good benefits and work hours. Walmart has a lower class of customers. Customers can be hard to deal with at times. Work can be difficult only because the company is micro managed. Your opinion means nothing.
good,A typical night begins with a quick meeting going over any special annocuncements and which atea everybody will be working at. The wokplace is pretty laid back and I learned that you must work as a team to get the job done.
good,"...but it can also be stressful, but what you put into it, you will get out of it. The hardest part of Walmart is obtaining the hours you need to make a decent living as an entry level employee, and getting management to follow through on promises regarding advancement in your career without becoming too frustratingly annoying."
good,"Bom trabalho em equipe, aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, boa convivência entre os funcionários, gerencia eficaz e eficiente a soluções de problemas."

good,It was an easy place to work. Fun people to be around .th work pay is really good overall. I've learned that teamwork will help you get a lot of stuff done way faster den you think.
good,It's a constant and stable job. I worked from 2:00 p.m until 11:00 p.m. I worked a lot of overtime and didn't mind it. It's great if you're looking for a place to work immediately.
good,i work in the apparel department and i get 30 hours a week and sometimes they will give you 40 depending how many hours they give. work is always busy can get stressful at times but i get through it.  doing the best i can at my job.
good,I day at would start at 7 am. Where I go in the back room pick in inventory for two departments. Then I could work that inventory or stock for the departments. Then I would walk the department and serutiy the stock that was price value the hardest part was working two department with lack of help management
good,very strict in some areas of the job. expectations are easy to meet depending what part of the store your in. fast paced in the automotive area. overall I believe a good company to work for
good,Overall a pretty good place to work. no problems with managers.  Decent pay and they stay within my availability. The work is pretty laid back and it's easy to catch on quick.
good,Great jobs. Awesome benefits. Good customer service. Nice environment. Friendly people. Hours are good. You get paid for what you worked. Overtime was allowed tremendously. Loved working there.
good,I start at 40hrs and I lked that a lot but after my first check I never received 40hrs again. It was a great place to work .I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Was over all a good job, would Recommend this job to a personal friend or family member. Management over all was quiet friendly and really was just looking for your best interest at heart. honestly, i really liked working there. i was sad when i had to leave, would actually love to go back. "
good,"To be clear--this review is for Distribution Center jobs. It worked very well with my home life, great pay and good benefits. Overall I was very satisfied working here."
good,"I have enjoyed working here. I have watched some of my customers grow and get married, watch their grandchildren grow up and I have seen some of the pass. Dealing with people's photos I get to to a certain point live a little through them. Walmart has quarterly bonuses if criteria is met, a 401, vision, dental and health benefits. They offer life insrance, short term and long term disabilities. They are a good company to work for,but I do suggest that you make sure you I's are dotted and your t's are crossed and always have a paper trail."
good,"My typical work day at Walmart would have been very smooth. Starting the shift it would be slow through out the shift it would pick up. Most days i'd leave work feeling satisfied knowing my job performance was good. The hardest part of work for me would have been dealing with management. I didn't have too many issues personally with management, but I've witness things get crazy. There was definitely a lot of favoritism and fraternization displayed through many on the management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting very sweet customer compliments, and knowing you truly helped someone. People really overlook retail jobs, but theres so much good. The only thing i really learned, that i confidently can pass on and apply to the work force is, ""if you have a problem with favoritism, you must become the favorite."""
good,I did like this job pay checks helped more with bills children etc. The only problem was they werent understanding about baby sitters. I tried my hardest to stay at this job i took 3 buses and did my best but i would take this job again if i could i got paid more than my last job and work was guarenteed.
good,Great company to work for. The company has been great to me and my family. I have been treated with respect and offered leadership and support that has aided in my professional development. Great people and greta culture.
good,I worked in the deli and got swamped daily by vacationers order pounds and pounds of meat and cheese.  My first week working there a coworker lost a digit in a meat slicer and I was left alone to fill ordrers
good,There would be days  where there would be nothing to do and I would have to go work in other areas. I would even ask to learn different areas in order to get more hours.
good,"It is just time for something different and I am able to retire from wal Mart with 22yrs at this store, in the Auto Care Department. I am a very people person. I treat people the way I want to be treated."
good,"Its not the greatest or most fun job but its a job.  You go in, clock in, do your job and leave. In my store everyone seems settled and happy with their job.  I want to promote higher and higher, which is very difficult if you aren't willing to transfer stores. Its just not for me."
good,"Documented items not sold, damage or return to the store and create new vendors for donations established donations of bike to under privilege elementary children, set up regular donations to local churches and central union mission for men"
good,"Very friendly staff, always something to do or work on, lots of customers to attend to, must learn every department to ensure help to customers, steady pay, walmart does provide very great break room and sometimes free food to staff."
good,Walmart  is a great place to work with many opportunities to advance and grow. The management at the location where I previously worked the management were fair and had great attitude to boost morale and positivity to the work place and the associates.
good,Typical day at work is by checking how many people call off that day and how many cases we are going to rec. I learned how a team came together and learn how to help each other to make cases per man hour. The hardest part was having to quit.
good,"It was great working at Walmart! The management there was fantastic as well as the fellow associates. The only issue I have is the hours that they would schedule, and how often the benefits and bonuses they offered which was rare."
good,"would go to the back and clock in then make my way to the front to find my customer service manager and get my breaks and make my way to my till, i would greet customers and scan their items while keeping small talk through the process"
good,"Very busy work place, sometimes stressful due to the day. hardest part about the job working in the different departments not knowing all the techniques because of short staffed."
good,Es una buena empresa con oportunidades solo que falta mejor salario.
good,I think it is a good job for people who enjoy other people and to communicate with those people  in an organization.You have to be people friendly and open mined about each person feelings.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day was talking to the customers when I bagged their groceries. Making the customer leave with a smile, knowing somebody cares, and making them feel comfortable when they come to my line."
good,"add stuff into freezer after counting invetory. learned how to work in below freezing areas, and the workers and mangers made this workplace alot more enjoyable."
good,"My co-workers were friendly. They were very helpful  as I learned Walmart's way of doing things. Willing to train you, Management doesn't stand by their promises. They work with you on scheduling."
good,"It's a great company to work for. However, it's unfortunate when you get a store manager who is about who you are versus what your capable of doing.  Multiple opportunities to move up in the company."
good,Local de muito aprendizagem para a carreira profissional.
good,Expect to work if you are a stocker.  Most of the people were nice.  You are on your feet the whole time.  You get two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch.  The hardest part of the job was heavy lifting and managing the pallets and garbage.
good,"A typical work day for a young cashier would start off by me clocking in and getting sent to a specific register until my first 15 minutes break. Then after returning from my first break I would get sent to another register until lunch break. After lunch hour I would return to a supervisor and they would then give me another register to go to. During this final task I would receive another 15 minute break. After the final break I would work on any task that was given until the remainder of the shift. I would like to add that cleaning, door greeting, and price checking is included during a typical shift."
good,"I would still be working there if it was close to home, but alas it was a 3 hour bus ride to get there, and when i requested a transfer to a closer one for school- i was denied due to the state of how many people were working at the store, an a major management change."
good,"Great teamwork among the associates."
good,As a Walmart associate in electronics I was able to be one on one of my customers and help them very personally and they appreciated that. I was also able to open up on my geeky side of electronics & gaming
good,"Empresa organizada, limpa. E de bom  relacionamento"
good,"There's really not a whole lot to being a cashier that's different than any other places. The nice part was starting out at $10/hr, which for me as a senior in high school was perfect."
good,"Las políticas y procedimientos de la empresa son clave para el desarrollo de las labores y estas propician un ambiente de trabajo armonioso, mismas que Walmart las promueve en cada una de las actividades a desarrollar, procurando siempre el bienestar del empleado, desafortunadamente el salario a percibir por las funciones asignadas es bajo y la exigencia cada vez es mayor."
good,"a typical day at work is me sitting down at an office all day, I have learned in my current position Transportation knowledge, WHS admin and replenishment skills."
good,"PRP es una buena escuela para comenzar una carrera en el mundo de las relaciones públicas, aprendes mucho y amplia tu panorama de vida y profesional."

good,"A typical day at Walmart was to greet every customer with a smile and remember customers are always number 1. Give each and every customer excellent service and complete accurate transactions at register. "
good,it was a great learning experience working for Walmart. You meet and talk to so many different people but it was great. Its even better when you get to know your customers and can call there order with out them even saying a word. the staff was really cool all the ladies and gentlemen were so nice.
good,"While production is of course a main focus of employee performance, management did make sure to provide enough training and development to ensure goals were attainable."
good,Good for someone who is fresh out of high school. Worked 10pm to 7pm. Learned about customer service in depth and how to manage different situations. Workplace culture is okay if you know how to keep to yourself and away from the high school like drama.
good,"lots to learn with the chance to improve yourself and grow in your skill set ."
good,I had health problems and had to leave they put me on the no re hire list because i was in the hospital and didn't show up even though my mom called and explained things to them. they put me on the floor and when i had problems the managers got attitude.
good,Awesome great money if you like to get down and dirty. Lot of hours. Strictly weather based so be prepared for the hot cold rainy and the sleety. As James Brown said is a man's world out there.
good,This job was interesting. U would go in at night and stock shelves. I enjoyed it and the people I worked with. It was hard getting use to working nights.
good,Clocking in going to the meeting following instruction handle business flipping the produce treys and replacing meat where it goes also unload trucks with Dog food
good,"You receive more breaks than most jobs, nice starting pay, easy to promote. Also if one area of the store isn't for you, you can be moved to another department. You just need to be on time for your shifts and not leave early to be successful at Wal-Mart."
good,"Once you join the team to work, you're already dreading the day and hoping for it to go by quickly. Everyone feels the same way but everyone makes each other laugh, smile, and make their own fun together. There will be ""waves"" in which customer's will spill into the store and this usually lasts for at least an hour. Everyone is supportive; once there is a bad time at work then everyone is taking care of someone."
good,"I was able to move forward in the company, from fresh-food maintenance, to deli employee, within three months I was given the opportunity to learn a whole new area in the store, and could not have been happier with where the store had taken me, I can say that most stores do not give you that type of opportunity."
good,"typical day at walmart would be walking the floor to make sure no trash was laying around, making sure everything was stocked on  the floor and giving and completing daily notes."
good,Wal-Mart was a great place to grow my knowledge of Logistics and processes. Was exposed to cutting edge improvements that shaped the industry over a 20 year period.
good,"Working for Walmart was a job I had to help build up work experience. It is a standard retail job just like you would think it would be. Stocking, customer service. It does help you build people skills if you are lacking them."

good,I have learned a lot from Walmart . I get support that I need and any help I need. I work in a very fast pace environment. always staying busy. the hardest part of the job is trying to finish on time with picking and packing . as to where we are being timed daily. the most enjoyable part is working with the people and having a fun time .
good,"working for walmart was enjoyable. i was an overnight stocker, responsible for bringing freight out to the floor at 10pm and unloading / stocking it all before 7am. usually around 7-8 full stacked pallets. good work environment must be a fast paced individual to stock and unload."
good,Working at walmart can be very challenging at first because if you haven't ever dealt with so many people at once you could get confused quickly. The hardest part about this job is maintaining enough open registers a peak times to ensure steady and fast checkouts. The most enjoyable thing about the job is how big of a family you can create with all the employees that work with you. I've learned how to handle my most difficult situations as a manager at this job. Problems can arise quickly but you have to humble yourself and make sure you handle them accordingly so it wont get out of hand.
good,It was a good place to work at. Great environment and the employees are a good to work with. The customers give you the extra lift to get through shifts by laughing and conversing with you while you checking them out.
good,Great place to work lot of ways to move you the ladder. diffrent shift avalible so not stuck on a Schedule so it is easer to get thing done. Great people to work with

good,"Management treats hourly employees bad and sometimes they forget they are people too, if you want the staff to treat customers good and not steal they should be respected too"

good,"I was employed at Wal-mart for 8 years.  It is an overall enjoyable place to work.  You are never bored, there is always something to do, and your hard work and contributions to the store are appreciated.  Overall, management was personable and knowledgeable, co-workers kind and friendly, and customers polite. Great job culture/core beliefs."
good,"A typical day as an associate consists of customers that need help, freight to be worked, and inventory management. I've learned how to be fast paced, to find alternatives to solutions that did not work out regarding customer's issues. I have also learned to balance my stress and communicate better with other associates. Management was great. The hardest part of the job was when customers needed and my department was understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the connections I make with my co-workers."
good,"Good place to work nice coworker you learn a lot, good opportunities to grow and give us discount good customer service and nice product to buy and enjoy"
good,my first day i learned the basics of the store. how its ran. how the employees are close and communicate well with each other. it has a good workplace culture to the store. hardest part of the job would be getting all our tasks done by the end of our shifts. and last the most enjoyable part of the job would be unloading the trucks and moving at a fast pace. making sure merchandise go where they need to go.
good,Banco Walmart es una empresa con desarrollo a largo plazo
good,Working for Walmart is very fast paced. There's never dull moments in Walmart stores. You really have to know how to work with customers attitudes. Staff is friendly
good,"Overall company and structure is good, but when new management arrived to store changes where made but I didn't help to improve store.  Walmart the company is a great corporation just certain management individuals."
good,"Over the five years I spend with Walmart, every day was a challenge and a reward. Customers are appreciative when you are knowledgeable and listen. Balancing school and work was easy with the outstanding management staff. They not only allowed me to attend college while working full time, they promoted it. "
good,It was a good place to work pay wasn't that good but neither were the hours worked. If I had a chance to work full time I probably would because it would pay better.
good,"There are no typical days at walmart. Especially for leaders. New issues pop up hourly and, for many of us, the challenge is our favorite part."
good,overall working at Walmart was a good experience. I would come to work with a smile on my everyday the managers were nice. working on the register was fun as well. customers were always nice.

good,While studying i had to find a job which provides stable schedule and overnight shifts. I found this job at Walmart. I really loved this position. I miss the great people that I worked with
good,"Soon as you walk into the workplace your greeted by smiles of most your co workers, and not the smiles they have to give you true genuine kindness and affection. The managers there are all kind and genorus of your real life (at home) situation, as in if your badly ill or have trouble paying rent and looking at eviction. I learnt so many skills working there like the cash register and working the pallet jack and other heavy equipment"
good,After transferring from Wilkes Barre Walmart I had an expectation that this Walmart would be similar to the previous one I worked at. Even though there are plenty of good days there is also some bad days with it. I know there can be room for improvement in communication between managers and associates in this facility.
good,"Love working there, just management were pretty rude and made you feel less than what you are. I had to quit because my high risk pregnancy and what I did wasn't okay with my doctor."
good,A typical day started at 4 am and lasted until 1 pm. I would be assigned an area to pick in. Usually I was sent to pick the chilled items for grocery pickup orders. I would have to pay attention to dates and search for the item if it was not out on the shelf. The managers pretty much left me alone because I worked hard and they saw that. The culture at Walmart is mixed. There are strict rules to follow such as dress code but you are allowed to express yourself through accessories. The hardest part of the job is when we had 10-13 orders an hour to dispense and we still had picks to take care of when it seemed like you were the only one trying to handle customers out in the parking lot. The best part of the job was seeing the happiness on people's faces as they got their groceries and the relief of them not having to go inside and fight the crowds.
good,"I worked for this company a little over a year. I left only because another company offered me more money. The management wasn't bad and they were helpful. The work environment was friendly, fun. If Wal-Mart gave raises more often they would be the best."
good,"Busy workplace, the day goes by quickly."
good,Good company to grow within. I have worked for the company for over 10 years and have moved from part time to a member of salary The company has allowed me to have proper training and resources that will help me excel in future companies.

good,"The store I worked at was very friendly and all the employees got along, the trouble didn't start until there were new managers transferred in. Some new managers were good, some didn't care about anything, and others were too serious and uncompromising. There were many employees that has been there for 10 to 20 years and these managers were threatening to fire them for the smallest reasons."

good,"I have been employed at walmart for all of a year and i have to stay it was not a bad job, the money was good and the people were decent. The main problems that i had from walmart is that you dont have just one manager you have roughly 8 who all tell somthing different and whew that can get annoying ... Also the change in regulations and rules constanly fluctuated.... And after awile the store just dosent feel the same."

good,"Minimum wage, hard work.  I was not there long enough to get a raise, but I was glad to have a job.  I did not know who my manager was, as the unloaders more or less supervised themselves ."
good,I worked overnight at Walmart for about 8 months .Met a lot of friendly people and learnt how to use most equipment within the first three days. Good work environment and a lot of friendly costumers. Though the time limit given to stock overnight was rough and fast pasted .

good,Unique Experience / Great Place to Start When You Don't Have Previous Background. I would highly reccomend working at Walmart when you are looking for place to start working at in order to help you get back on your feet. Management at the Hammond Location is great too.
good,Wal-mart was great at first. Then after Sam Walton died things went down hill. Policy changed alot. Like associates didn't matter. Also being there really over 20 years I felt they pushed us out.
good,A typical night for me is coming in at 8 p.m. walking the store looking for any opportunities so I can go ahead and make the necessary adjustments to help close down the store. While being overnight I've learned how to adapt to what ever the condition is of the store and still be able to make the correct decisions to turn the store over. The most challenging part of the job is dealing with multiple call ins and having to move associates around to cover for call ins. The most enjoying part of the job is motivating my associates to do their best and help turn the store over.
good,"Coworkers are very friendly and helpful. Managers are very hands on. Walmart also has strict policy against overwork, breaks must be taken. It's very by the book but fair."

good,This was my first real job and it's a good place to start. Lots of training and will help you develop a lot of necessary skills you will use in all jobs. The management is pretty good and the discount and perks around holidays are a good bonus. Lots of flexibility to advance to different departments or positions. Hours were good too.
good,I handled all cashiers on the over night shift. I also was in charge of changing out all the money in the registers & the ATM. A typical day for me was going around the entire store picking up things from different departments that didn't belong and take the product to the correct area. I also took care of customers and answered any questions they had. There were some managers who made an everlasting impression on me and some who did not. The hardest part about my job was adjusting to the over night shift. The part I enjoyed about my job was the customers and the associates. I have always loved meeting new people.
good,"Walmart is a wonderful place to work at from the environment, management, to our loving loyal customers. The hardest part of the job was learning to drive the fork lift but now that i know how to drive it i love doing it."
good,"I enjoy working for Wal-Mart. There are plenty opportunities for advancement and time to make the most out of each customers visit. There is a lot of physical work with unloading trucks and stocking merchandise, but at the end of the day, you know you had a good days' work in."
good,It was good working at Walmart and the manager was great but the only drawback was that I had to work third shift which was from 11 pm to 7 am.  It was difficult to find rides to work at that time but I was always there and on time.
good,Working for Walmart has been a rewarding experience. It helped me through grad school and beyond. There is great opportunity for advancement at Walmart

good,As Asset Protection I enjoyed my work.  It was my job that got me terminated in the long run.  They wanted results but were unable to allow me to do the job in some degree.
good,"Very productive place to work , very fun and busy environment, the job is easy to understand and most associates are easy to get along with, there were alot of great in store activities to engage in, they treated you like a family even outside of work."
good,"Once you are hired you have a job for life. There is never a shortage of hours, however management does not work very hard. Sets the stage for poor employee work ethics."

good,"Although I would still rate my experience at Wal-Mart positively, I would say the hardest part of my position was that there was not a standard training program to ensure I was given the necessary tools and knowledge needed for my role. I also worked nights which was not ideal for my job/work life balance. The most enjoyable part of my role was that it was a challenging role."
good,"At one time it was a good place to work.  But with current management it is not.  Benefits and company culture are still good, but individual stores may not be because of management at that store."
good,Working for Walmart was pretty decent. The managers did as much as they can to help the customers and associates. It pays rally good and also gives good hours. The work was really easy nothing to complain about and always had help from other associates.
good,I like to work there because of the interaction with customers and coworkers. I worked the overnight shift and you have same shift always but any change was advise to you with at least two weeks notice. also the supervisor was a really good one.

good,"Walmart is a good stepping stone job that will give you good experience to allow you to move on to other jobs in the future. I learned how to work tires and complete oil changes, and made good friends of some of my coworkers."
good,"Being a good stocker takes hard work; it is a physically demanding job. There is a lot to do in a short amount of time. But you learn the value of time, how to prioritize, and how to sweat."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. The staff is super friendly and definitely makes it a good place to work. I worked in the Cosmetics Department and then stepped up to Housewares and Furniture. A typical day in the life for me is working my perpetual inventory screen, price changes, merchandizing, providing a clean and well stocked department(s)/ and store, responding to customer requests, maintaining a safe and clean work area."
good,"The cashier position is good for a customer service focused job.  I enjoy our location, people, and customers.   Management was flexible with my available hours.  The only issue is trying to trade hours for time that isn't approved off.   The hours you work based on availability may not be consistent."
good,"One day of my work is most of the time when I am in grocery  customer service, returns the goods, help me improve the english, colleagues and I get along very well, the hardest part when we can not please the customer. The most I like about work is to attend and be able to help clients and colleagues who only speak spanish."
good,"Money canter was kind of slow in mornings but by mid day it got pretty study. We cashed checks, made out money orders,paid utility bills, and sent and received monies. Management was good. Customers were good for the most part. A few could be a little difficult. I like to follow rules and it was and it was hard working with the ones who don't because then it confuses the customers and makes it hard on everyone else. What I liked most was working with the people, most coworker and customer were very pleasant."
good,I learned how to be patient with customers that were irate. I enjoyed  the various people I got to interact with while checking them out. Sometimes management would be late with breaks or lunches however.
good,buena capacitacion laboral comedor muy economico horarios accesibles y cero valor al progreso laboral buenos tratos a nivel personal y cero defensa ante el ataque de un cliente

good,A typical day at work would consist of doing maintenance around the store. Anything form cleaning to waxing floors. The most enjoyable thing about this job was that I got to try something new.
good,Do everything correct the employee's are watching you. Stay focused always be on time that you were schedule. Speak to everyone and stay out the way.And get the job done.
good,"Good company to work for if you like retail. Most positions are part time, but they work with  you to maximize hours available and shifts. Quarterly bonus was a nice perk"
good,"I was greeted everyday by employees who cared and valued their job. Everytime I walked into walmart, I almost felt a sense of joy. Each manager was respectful."
good,this is a good company to start off with and get your feet wet. it will get you in the motion of entering the job world. there will be a lot of dealing with unhappy customers as it is a very big store and not everyone can be pleased so easily.
good,Its cool i like the people the atmosphere the experience altogether. Never a dull day at walmart i'll tell you that! The people you meet are glorious!
good,The staff makes a point to be kind to one another and customers. we get it done we do safety from oshea and texas state we do what it takes to save money and live better
good,each day was full of learning experiences. I enjoyed the job and some of the people I worked with but sometimes you get some worst days what place doesn't have it just do your job and enjoy your day.
good,I thought that Walmart was a good place to work the benefits and pay were really good. And the work was consistent and fairly easy. I liked the hours and the availability.
good,"Wal-Mart was an excellent place, but the management was poor as well as the co-workers there. I had several jobs working there(Photo-Lab Tech, Stocker, Cashier, LayAWay and Customer Service), which was great, but the team I had was very slow and poor. The hardest part of the job was dealing with slow co-workers and rude also, the best part was helping the customer's with all there needs and making there day better."
good,Pretty much how you think Walmart is. Underpaid and tasked with working multiple jobs. Made some good friends though and it always had interesting people coming through
good,"Wal-Mart has changed a lot since I worked there, but benefits are good, pay is much better, stock matching options are a great benefit, there is plenty of room to grow in such a large company, job security is high, and you can get steady schedules and many hours."
good,Great place to work management is very nice. Pay is very good and if there long enough benafits is worth it.never had a problem with anyone there liked my shift.
good,The people I worked with and the customers I met throughout the day made the job even more worthwhile. meeting the other workers in the company really made being there enjoyable.
good,"walmart was great"

good,My co workers are amazing an even in other areas they are nice an kind an helpful. The manager is awesome an he trys an helps you an what ever you got in your personal life.
good,Its a good place to work your first job but I wouldnt suggest making a career out of it. The one I worked at had great managers who actually cared for their employees.
good,"This was my first taste of corporate real estate.  Lots of work to do, handling up to 80 properties over 4 states as Wal-Mart was in a massive expansion mode.  The job entailed working with local officials, retail companies, real estate brokers and construction contractors, not to mention the Wal-Mart Real Estate Committee."
good,this can be a great job but when you are going through store managers like crazy you find that you have managers that are too big for thier shoes.  I loved that job and loved helping people but when I got blamed because a dept did not make money since something was out of season I had issues.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers. "
good,Good place to work if that is what you gonna do other wise dont even batter to work there. I do believe that they need good managers or at least if they can guide you at your job.
good,"Everyone is like family,  its a fun place to work, I filled prescriptions, interacted with customers. "
good,This place was cool to work at they didn't really take it into consideration if someone wanted to move up in the company and try and change jobs. They we good at making sure everyone got their breaks on time but majority of the time they forgot.
good,It's a good place to start working and can become a full term career if that something you would like to make it. The advancement is quite possible if you work hard and proficient enough for it.
good,Very friendly people to with and the work her is very straight forward and easy. You also get a small discount on anything you buy here. Overall was a good first job experience for me.
good,"Su manera de trabajar es diferente, pero al igual la gente a cargo no esta lo suficientemente capacitada."
good,"Assorted Activities"
good,"WalMart has a strong culture, but some of the things are kept in the dark and not communicated from management to employees. As some people try to be transparent, others will hide."
good,"Retail manager for 14years. Ran retail stores for 12 years as store manager. 11 yrs Target then with 3 yrs with Walmart. "
good,"Empresa buena en general, con beneficios personales, desarrollo de talento, más falta gente con tacto en los puestos de nivel alto."
good,Walmart was a great place to work. They work with you on your hourly schedule they teach you different things about Walmart you never knew. They have great benefits once your there for 90 plus days
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. if you need a job than go with Walmart. they are great if you need to increase your house hold income. you have to work around their schedule and they will not work around yours.
good,"A typical day is high paced, customer oriented. You have to be on your toes which is very nice because your not in one spot your always on the move. Customers demand the best and if your on your game it makes the day fly by."
good,The job was physically demanding but was well worth it. Hours always flew by when working because there was always something to do and stay busy. I would definitely like to work there again.
good,"Tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo, bastante organizado, llegar y cada departamento al cuidado de sus responsabilidades, la mayoría de las personas son amables y bastante pacientes para capacitar sobre las actividades que se realizan. Se aprende a trabajar en equipo, ser proactivo, tratar con socios y sus necesidades de una manera muy amable. La dirección depende del área puede ser accesible o no tanto, los colegas suelen ser amistosos, quizá lo más complicado es el rebote de horarios. Me encantó el ambiente con mis compañeros de trabajo y lograr las metas propuestas."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to have job security being that anywhere you may want to move to there will always be a place you can transfer to. Benefits are not good at all but its better than nothing. A lot of work a lot of hours and not enough pay.
good,Wasn't a hard place to work. Only did a couple of jobs there and its was ok for the time spent. Never worked for a place that big with the different outlooks of other employees.
good,"The Walmart had a recent management change so I cant use my contact anymore. Outsourced leave of absence program that made me lose job multiple times. Other then that, it was a lot of fun working there. I tried getting a job there again but was told that I failed the ethics test. Fishy."
good,"As a manager for Wal-Mart, I had the opportunity to learn and grow from my peers. I loved the time there and maybe one day will return. Management, however, needs to improve. What made me so good at management is i learned from others how not to be."
good,"Go to work, go to our startup meetings. When finished go orderfill for about 3 hrs. You then get a 20 min break before another 3 hrs roughly then go to lunch. You get finished for the night whenever the routes we had are done. I learned how to stack freight very well. Management team is not the best. They make a lot of mistakes but they do at least seem to care for the associate for the most part. Most of the people there are really cool. Hardest part of the job is the day is and day out lifting of heavy cases. It becomes strenuous on the body very quickly. I am 24 and starting to have back issues after just 2+ years. Best part of the job was working only 3 days a week."
good,"Working at walmart as my first job was a great experience. They paid well more than 2.00 over the minimum wage which is difficult to find in that area. I really did enjoy working there, I would work for walmart again."
good,"A typical day at work involves managing money, assisting customers as well as other employees. Learned different procedures with customer service. The workplace culture was mixed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was friendly staff."
good,"Love the people I work with!! Management in our store is good. The raises are weak and only once a year. It's hard to get noticed by upper management when you are on the front end, leaves you feeling stuck"
good,"Pretty nice coworkers, laid back, hardworking people, pretty decent management... it's just too bad so many people overlook Walmart because of what some of the customers/employees are like... not every single employee or customer is weird/crazy etc. There are some very knowledgeable people who work here and I like coming to work."
good,They were ok to work for but they wanted to write me up for being poor at production even if i picked up speed and they were not letting me transfer to another part of the store
good,working at Walmart i learned plenty of skills and met a lot of friendly hard working people. I also learned how it felt to work with a team and also learn to work independently.
good,"At certain times you do not more from your register due to customer volume. Loved checking out customers, but I would like to have done more. Most of the supervisors were good."
good,very laid back job and easy. its hard to stay on your feet for 10 hours straight without having knee problems. i enjoyed most is how laid back it is depending on what department u work in
good,"The job itself is not bad, the stress can be troubling, the drama between workers causes a lot of stress. It is hard to please management, as the harder you work the more they want."
good,"Walmart provides the ability for individuals to advance their career within the company.  Many Associates including myself have accomplished this based on their work ethic, their ability to adapt and change based on the company's needs."
good,"Walmart was a decent company to work with. The problem with working with Walmart is the fact you rarely do what is within your job description. As a cashier, I was spending a good chunk of my time on the sales floor.  Overall I made several friends and always enjoyed clocking into work. I would still be with Walmart if they wouldn't have let me go, but apparently my school schedule wasn't worth working with."
good,"Horaires de travail de trois fds sur quatre. Faire du 6-7 et parfois 8 jours en ligne. "
good,"Fast Passed, The hardest part was lifting at times do weight of boxes.  The best Part was the Training my staff of new products.  Most enjoyed making customers smile."
good,Como meu primeiro emprego fui instruído a fazer muitas coisas diferentes e consequentemente aprendendo coisas novas.
good,Wal-Mart was a good company to work for. I started as a part-time cashier and ended as an assistant manager. We did have fun there was almost like a family enviroment
good,The most hard part of the job was to deal with people that were very impatient or had food stamps card that didn't have any money on it but they calmed it did. The easiest part of the job was to basically cashier knowing how to deal with money and check people out accordingly.
good,"My experience with Walmart was pretty decent overall. The pay was decent, coworkers knew what they were doing when it came to performing job related tasks. Management was decent, although my department manager knew nothing about the department he was in charge of."
good,A typical night we would take 15 minutes to do our stretches and cheers which was fun. Check our schedules and it was never too hard. we got 2 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch. My favorite part was the coworkers that I worked with were friends.
good,zone department by myself 10 aisle to be exact within 5 hours because my hours were being cut my department was understaffed we were never schedule to work together for the zoning always alone or everyone in the morning and one person in the evening  to do everything. Work was always left over from the first shift for second shift to do because it was a department manger so it didn't matter but if the associate left the work from the morning for second shift the associate would get in trouble.  some Management and store manger are HORRIBLE don't really care about the opinions of their associate like they say they do. co worker are awesome everyone is nice and we acted like a big family they are funny and grow on you
good,"I met a lot of wonderful people whether it was co workers or customers, the work really keeps you on your feet and active. You get to be productive all the time."
good,Hit the floor running and work hard.  Always have management teams to lead you.  At the end of the day always had a sense of accomplishment in getting my tasks and work load done.
good,"as a security officer at walmart was never a dull moment, everyday was an adventure, everyday we had shoplifters, panhandlers, and rude customers, my job was to help the LP's in the store with the shoplifters, as a officer at walmart i had to do a lot of customers with was no problem, i enjoyed my job at walmart, but had to move on to better paying jobs."
good,"a typical day at work is fast- paced during the weekends, i learned how to be quick on my feet, some of my managers are great at their jobs, the culture of the work place is very welcoming, the hardest part of my job is dealing with the drama from teens, the enjoyable part is driving the forklift"
good,A typical day at work was making sure all the produce in the vegetables and fruits was clean and fresh. I cleaned the areas to ensure customers had a satisfactory visit to the store. Made sure to help customers when they couldn't find something. Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people find things.
good,"Walmart has its ups and down, but overall I've enjoyed my time there. Management is friendly and the hardest part of the job is staying on your feet during the shift. Management will work around your schedule to what best fits you. The most enjoyable part of Walmart is the culture they've built."
good,I did all bakery.  Transactions of sales. Order entry for custom cakes.  Customer service. Hardest part of the job was the odd hours scheduled it conflicted with personal life.
good,Amazing individuals while working at Walmart but the pay is a little low for all the stuff you have to deal with but the benefits we're good but the pain needs to be better
good,"Es muy buenas empresa con valores instituidos desde su fundación en EUA, con buenos estándares de excelencia y servicio."
good,"Simcoe Walmart has a great management team, with energitic associates. Looking to move around and help out in other departments?  Management can show you how. Looking for help with something you need done in your department? Anyone will help you, as long as you help them too. You get what you give, no matter how people think of you.  They pay you based on your experience, which was great. Overall, i love working here, and i love who i work with."
good,"Walmart is my favorite job. I loved going to work. I was a cashier and the people I talked too. I actually got to know some of my customers. They offer medical,dental & vision. I personally don't have anything bad to say about Walmart."
good,It was decent place to work when it wasn't busy and when there was enough staff. Sometimes it would get stressful when we were short staffed or when I needed help and no one was there.
good,"Walmart has nice incentives, but your customers will try to run over you and downplay you, as if you don't know 'YOUR' job, and will quick to use the phrase ""customers always right"""
good,"I am  working as a CAP2 Supervisor . I been working as a supervisor for almost an year. One of the hardest job in walmart. Have lot of stress. But I enjoys it. I don't know why?, maybe because i like to work hard. Management is quite okay. 4 days work ,3 days off, thats awesome."
good,"It was my first job, it was a good one to start with, people are nice and helpful, and the work was satisfying.  Management could be pretty lax so long as you were doing your job or showing that you were doing your best.  Often you'd be transferred to a position more to your ability if you couldn't cut it as cap 2.  My only real complaint was management at times seemed to forget the value of its workers, not all management, but some."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for.  Hours were okay and pay was reasonable. Company offered good benefits and retirement plans.  Duties were to stock merchandise during early morning shifts.
good,Its fun to help others. Every crew member works together to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the costumer feel love and appreciated
good,working is not a problem cause it always something to do but management need to pick up on communicating better with other fellow workers on how to do the job and training as well is not good. needs help with training workers to know and learn how to do he task the right way and finally the number 1 problem is management have a lot of favorite and it make others feel highly uncomfortable
good,Excellent work environment. Wonderful management. Opportunity for advancement. Excellent learning environment. Caring associates with team attitude. Benefits available only to full-time associates.
good,I liked working there but some of the policy's are not that good and it has its down fall with it .I would send people to work for them but you will work for your money
good,"Management at Walmart can be overwhelming, due to the lack of communication amougnst the employees. Although they are very attentive when it comes to meeting the customers needs."
good,"Awesome starter job! I was able to gain plenty of experience in multiple departments! Employees are always ready to help where they can. Hours maybe cut. That would cause a shortage of employees, but also present the opportunity to gain more knowledge of your position and others."
good,"Management was poor, but excellent technology that is sufficient in assisting customers. The best part about Walmart was the 9.00 an hour pay as a cashier."
good,A typical day at work is always eventfull your always going to learn something new from the customersand laugh and have a good time management was always there to help and answer any questions the hardest part was not being able to make every customer happy and the most enjoyable day was talkingand meeting new people everyday.
good,"Uma ótima empresa unida , a gerencia é espetacular sempre se dispondo a ajudar os demais colegas de trabalho"
good,Stocking shelves was fine you had to be pretty fast though they expect you to get 60 boxes an hour so you only can take 1 minute per item to find where it goes and stock it properly.
good,"I loved working here and would gladly work for Walmart again. I used to be under Walmart's CAP team 2, unloading trucks daily and stacking the freight onto pallets, stocking grocery aisles, taking pallets of freight to the floor. There, I learned how to use a pallet jack, how to stock and stack boxes efficiently, and general work ethics, being my first job. Management sometimes made life a little rough, but we always got what we needed done and felt good about it after we went home. Workplace culture, very White and Hispanic/Latino heavy. Hardest part of the job was when management was feeling moody, they'd assign us to a useless task when there was work to be done and we'd fall behind and really need to pick the pace up. Most enjoyable part of the job was feeling satisfied with myself and actually happy when I went home, exhausted and sore but looking forward to doing it again."
good,"Loved the job, but no one worked with my availability. I had a set availability due to baby sitter scheduling and was always scheduled outside of my availability"
good,You have to be able to adapt to change. They might put you in any area of the store at any given time. Must be able to remember detailed instructions and work at a fast pace.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work for.  I advanced quickly,  and would have advanced even further if I had stayed.  I left to start a family.  Multiple areas to work in."
good,"Empresa com princípios e comprometida com valores com seus associados,parceiros e clientes."
good,Fast paced but enjoyable work environment. Always learning from management and other employees. Love completing task throughout day to ensure customer satisfaction in the morning.
good,"The warehouse's have many positions and shifts to choose from, but do not think you will get out easy. It is a harder job than most, but at least they pay pretty well. Average benefits and time off work. Many of the associates I work with or around me have been at my work or with Walmart for 5, 10, 20 years and counting. Do not expect to ""move up"" unless you have a degree or know someone."
good,Greeting customers and assisting them with payments of cashing out at the register.  Training new associates.  The hardest part of the job is getting sufficient amount of hours per week.
good,"Working at store level was a whole different experience, but Home office was wonderful. I have never had any issues and the work culture and benefits are great."
good,Gostei de ter participado dá rede só realmente sai por motivos pessoais
good,"La información semanal y mensual siempre maneja los mismos indicadores los cuales son cuestionados a cada gerente por no dar los resultados objetivos, en este puesto aprendí a ser una persona altamente confiable, discreta, responsable, la rapidez es parte esencial del puesto, manejar y comunicar efectivamente con mi equipo de trabajo (subdirectora de operaciones, gerentes y subgerentes de 13 tiendas del estado de veracruz), a dar solución a problemas en el menor tiempo posible para no afectar la operación de las tiendas, aprendí a liderar personas con puestos ejecutivos (gerentes y subgerentes), el compañerismo y el trabajo en equipo siempre dará mejores resultados, la parte mas difícil de este puesto es depender todo el tiempo de la información que se les solicita a cada tienda  la cual no se envía en tiempo y forma, lo que mas me agrado de este puesto, es ampliar mi mente sobre como manejar el negocio de autoservicios apegado a indicadores para lograr el objetivo planeado, retroalimentar mis conocimientos con diferentes áreas corporativas, solucionar problemas y dar el mejor servicio a nuestros clientes."
good,A great place to work. Great environment not stressful. Management was professional and easy to work with. Easy work to do on a daily basis. No one hovering over if you're doing your job.
good,"atmosphere was busy, and customer/employee friendly"
good,"It was a great job to do while attending school, but I personally could not have done it long term. I was able to advance quickly, pay was ok, great summer job."
good,"Typically I would come in to work. I worked in automotive and my fellow peers, Dept Manager and Assistant Manager were very friendly and helpful and made the day very fun to work. Any where else in the store can be a little stressful depending on where you work. Most managers don't come to help when you need them too and many of the other associates can be rude or don't do what they're told."
good,I liked working there. I did the fun raising events.i worked whenever I could. I would get called in slot and I didn't mind. I would've stayed but I got sick and it prevented me from working. They aren't hiring anymore they are on a freeze.
good,I have enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I feel its a good place for young people starting out. I am just needing something better suited for me and my kids.
good,Liked working at Walmart friendly management employees was nice good working environment if you're into retail and like helping people I liked doing customer service
good,Being a cashier is an extremely busy job. I worked so hard for so little pay. You have to have excellent customer skills and a lot of patience. Your communication skills have to be outstanding and that's what I had.
good,"Management in my area was interesting. If there was a question, you would get various answers that would just lead to more questions. However, the associates were kind and is what made the job enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. It was a good job. The hardest part of the job was working in the heat. But, i eventually got used to it. I enjoy working outside, and also helping customers."
good,"There was a lot of work and I liked it because it kept me busy and made the day go by a lot faster. I liked unpacking boxes and stocking shelves. I learned how to run the register but it was very easy, and there are magnets you have to use to open some of the stuff that's locked up."
good,"Environment was great, co-workers were amazing, and pay was good but the only down fall were the high maintenance managers. They stressed easily so it stressed the employees. Other than that it was a good job, thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
good,I worked overnights stocking. This position was not for me. I did not like working overnights. Management was also very poor. The pay was decent for this position.
good,my time at Walmart was a good learning experience but the mangment wasn't the best to much micro managing and all the mangers would tell you different things
good,"While working at Wal-mart, I retrieved shopping carts, restocked out of place and/or returned items and filled in for door greeters/inspectors and cashiers. Management was organized and proficient, but the scheduling is unstable with low pay."
good,"Walmart has good benefits, nice coworkers, and good management. I feel like mangement listens to my concerns and tries to address them the best they can. Most of my coworkers are personable and decent people. Also, the benefits are good such as health care, vision plans, and dental care. Being understaffed and having grumpy customers are Walmart's main issues. They never hire enough employees to run all the different departments they have. Some of the customers become impossible to deal with when their orders are not made correctly. Also, changing departments is hard as well because a person has to be replaced first."
good,i learned team work and customer servise skills. Everyone worked very well together. My oly problem is that i couldnt find hours that worked for my family.
good,The job can be very laid back  & easy going depending on your department. Work can also be long and stressful depending on how many people is on shift
good,"Nice to work for although if you are on the in crowd moving up the ladder can be difficult. It helps to know and be close to individuals in higher positions. Seniority doesn't count when trying to move up, it's who you know and not what you know."
good,"Great place with great people, always have an opportunity to move up and further your career. There is always something to be learned and room to grow"
good,"Algunas veces te toca laborar más de 8 horas e incluso laborar sin hora de comida."
good,"I enjoy my actual work, I get frustrated that I can not promote internally. I am expected to move. I like the set hours and guarantee of hours, raises for the last three years have not been up to par."
good,"Considero que no walmart.com tive a oportunidade de aprimorar meus conhecimentos em gestão de pessoas, por ter um time relativamente grande e com diversos tipos de perfis; onde o programa de mentoring que eu participei meu ajudou nessa ""caminhada""."
good,A typical day is easy if you come in an do what's expected. Management is very good if you do your job. The only down side to the job is the pay an hours your not allowed to work 40 hours or more
good,Provided Knowledgeable Intel for great customer satisfaction. Delegating task to work more efficiently. Provided customer service in other departments when needed. Making sure every customer has a great experience. Adjusted to company changes.
good,"Walmart is the best of the large chain retail pharmacies. The system is very easy to use and the work environment is very good. However, they are slowly implementing a great deal of metrics into their pharmacies which is very similar to Walgreens. Hopefully, this is for the better, but I have a feeling that patient care might suffer in order to reach these newly implemented goals."
good,"friendly, and easy going work place. communication was good, a lot of team work. reasonable hours and pay, wonderful scheduling. clean building and great atmosphere."
good,"Es una empresa comprometida con el cliente, pero en algunas ocasiones lo que fallan son los encargados de área."
good,"Usually at work, I am on the cash register at almost all times. I love to work with people though, so I do not mind talking with all of my customers and asking them about their days. Although, with most places of employment, there is always going to be at least one customer who is grumpy and tries to ruin your day. You just have to thin, out of 100 people that I see a day, is one person really going to mess that up?"
good,"La cultura que manejo la empresa de Walmart de México y Centroamérica es muy interesante ya que te enseña a ser mejor persona en un ámbito laboral, la empresa se preocupa por la integridad de sus trabajadores tiene muchas cosas que se deberían aprender"
good,"Working for Walmart is a good place to start, its a good company and managers are always nice, Not enough hours. Enjoyed the fast paced environment, makes your day go by faster, also the employees are usually very friendly. Didn't like the hours, there was not enough."
good,"A typical work day was to clock in, talk to your respective manager about today's to-dos, and then start working on your checklist.  Once you are done, then you maintain your current work space and help around if needed."
good,Unloading the truck deliveries was really difficult but the male employees never made me feel obvious for being a petite female. They proceeded  to find job duties I would be more comfortable and efficient doing.
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work. You were given the chance to learn new skills while working there, and things were good environment. There were some things that didn't go well, bc they didn't understand that you have family, and family comes first."
good,"A day at work for Wal~Mart was never dull and boring, there were many things that were taught to me about the business and the equipment that I would be using while working there."
good,It was really laid back. the people I worked with was really nice and cool. I good HRS so I still had time for me and my family they pay good you get good benefits and what so its an good company to goo with.
good,"Being a prototype store, the store is ever changing in the jobs and job tasks. It a great place for flexible people looking for different experience. This store also provides plenty of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Walmart offers you advancement opportunity to management without a college degree provided you work hard, come to work, and follow rules.  Negative aspects are that you don't get benefits until after 1 year unless you are made full time.  And they have a point system for absences.  (only 4 absences and you are terminated.) I have been there 3 years and only 1 absence a year but I have seen people there over 10 years be terminated for 5 - 6 understandably good reasons for being absence get terminated."
good,"Management was very laissez faire, did not work much, sometimes would leave me with too much to do on my own. Wage was lower than what I signed for and I had to fight to get it changed. Other wise was an excellent place to work."
good,"4 shifts"
good,"Work is constant one order after another,rest and then another order    "
good,It's a great work environment and the people are awesome. If you have another job they really work with you. The customers are garrented to make you smile. This is great for anybody.
good,I liked my customers iliked my boss trusted me to do my job efficientlyhe made it feel like I was family too i liked making the customers feel important
good,always working stock and doing customer service. friendly atmosphere and easy placement in different areas of the store. bad part of the jobs is about how you can do so much and still be unrecognized by management.
good,"Associates there are very nice, great place to meet people and become a more social person. Work during the week day are usually nonexistent and will usually just consist of stocking and cleaning. "
good,"Daily work started immediately when you clock in. I learned supervisor skills, and how to manage multiple workers under me. I enjoyed working with different people, who had different skill sets."
good,"I would understand getting a week off for one death. However, when three people very close to a person die and they ask off for a few weeks off without pay due to extremely horrible circumstances, you would think they could give it to them. "
good,"Love my job and the other associates i worked with. Management was always on different pages. Pay isnt much,but for the kind of job you do you cant expect much. Advancement is there,but if you want it you have to work for it."
good,Wal-Mart gives decent benefits I was only seasonal but its an alright place to work for a first or last job but black Friday is hard and you may have to stay to close up.
good,"Esperar el arribo de las unidades según el planning, todos los días se aprende algo nuevo ya que cada es distinto, el ambiente entre coordinadores el cordial, lo mas dificultoso es cuando por ejemplo el cliente tienes atraso en su operación de mas de 24 hras y lo que mas me gusta que todos los días te relacionas con personas distintas."
good,Carry out daily task as assigned and other miscelanous tasks that are added to the daily routine as needed. Great job to start a job career; there is potential for growth and the knowledge learn can be transferred towards another employment. Good facility that is goal oriented; communication is a must.
good,"A typical day at work would be described as hectic, Having to kill your freight that was received, Binning what ever over stock you may have. Days can get very busy and time will pass quite quickly. I have learned a lot about shipment problems and ordering processes. The hardest part of the job is the daily paperwork that needs to be completed weekly. The part i love about my job is the co-workers i have."
good,They are an awesome company. I wish I still worked there. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Breaks were acceptable. The should accept doctors notes..
good,Liked seeing regular customers.Customer service was great doing different things.great place to work.our new boss was really great.Good place to work.
good,"At the beginning of each day, we would set up the backroom with freight pallets and food/ pharmaceutical carts. Freight would be unloaded off the trucks and unto their designated zone to be stocked. Once all freight was unloaded and organized, our next step would be to pull the freight out onto the sales-floor. As CAPS associates, our services also went to stocking freight, aiding other employees for different assignments and helping customers with any inquiries. The overall work environment was consistent and steady."
good,"Walmart as a company has poor management and organization. The pharmacy is slightly its own entity so circumstances were better. Great group of people to work with, like family. Customers difficult to deal with more times than not."
good,I Really Liked It Even though it Could Have been more of  a Better Work place. I liked the work I did even though it  was a challenge I liked the challenge though. If I had the chance I would work there again.
good,"I have a great time working with the other people that I do. The management has a high turn over rate, but there is always room for advancements in the Walmart community."
good,"This job was very interesting if you like to constantly be on the move this is it . Sometimes we would stay out of the floor , late at night we would help out coworkers with stocking shelves"
good,"fun place to work, very friendly co workers, loved to help the customers and greet them, u dont just work in 1 area you suppose to stay in your area or near it but they will try to put u on the other side of the store and then u have to run back to your section if they call for help or if a customer needs help"
good,Would work again if the opportunity presented itself. You learn a lot with this company sense you work more then one job. Great opportunity for anyone.
good,"the staff was excellent when i worked in Georgia compared to the one in Texas. But the hours over all were horrible, they would not let you work a full 8 hour shift. In Texas they'll label an employee at part time and always give them full time hours but that means they dont get the benefits."
good,Good company with interesting and challenging work.  High caliber people.  Company provides many opportunities for growth and learning.  Demanding work and size and scale of company results in one never running out of high priority work initiatives.
good,"Working here helped me advance my customer service skills in some of the most intense situations. "
good,At this company my responsibly was the manger the meat department. I made sure that we had all the needs and know how to do our daily tasks. Working here i learned how to lead a team and work with up management. The hardest part of the job was not having a full staff to do daily tasks. I really enjoyed the way the customers smiled after u help them find what they was looking for.
good,"I have recently found i need more mental stimulation  to succeed. WalMart is a constantly changing company, with differt leaders all the time. They also have to many chiefs not enough indians."
good,"On most days there was plenty to do so time passed quickly. Management offered necessary training and I liked being cross-trained for various jobs.  However, being a greeter when times were slow was too boring for me."
good,"Walmart always had friendly employees when I worked there, and the managers were strict, yet forgiving.  The only downside was working in the toys department, but that's always hectic."
good,Working For walmart is hit or miss. Working for the company its self is great with good benefits. Its the store managment that can make or break you experience. the overall company will take care of you.
good,managers are always there for the employees to talk to when you have a problem. Also they will do everything in there power to accommodate your needs.
good,"Hands on experience and on the job training at the world's largest retailer. Many opportunities for advancement in a very diverse number of fields within the retail industry. A typical day at work was fun and friendly by co workers and mangers. "
good,"I actually really enjoyed working at Walmart and had the opportunity to advance my career. If I had the chance to go back in the management field, I wouldn't hesitate."
good,"I was never trained as a department manager, I was expected to either learn as I went or already know what to do. My first day I was immediately sent off with my mc40 and expected to do my new job. And there was no room for error or a grace period for being new to the job, it was do it right or face the consequences, an intimidating way of thinking when you have no training outside of the computers which did very little to truly help. I did end up learning a lot and am thankful for the assistant manager over me because she did her best to help me, but the constant stress over being spread too thin and not having enough time in a day to to all that I needed to do, as well as not having any help to handle the minor things that could be passed off and lighten my load, made it too much for me to handle any longer"
good,I loved this job. i stocked the baby area and it was great. It's a workout. The managers were pretty good and helpful. Coworkers were awesome. I didn't have any problems. I just have a family and stuff happens.
good,"The employees were always nice and out going.  They were helpful in showing me ""the ropes"" and created a family like atmosphere which was great.  I loved being part of their bakery team and learned many new skill sets which has furthered steered me in the direction of food service."
good,Working with the team I was with was very rewarding because I was able to expand my mind to new ideas and actions. The immediate management was amazing and I felt like part of the team which I have never felt at any other job I have had.
good,"In this job you are required to have lots of patience"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me clocking in, break down pallets, clean aisles,remove and degree and out of date packages. The job itself was quite relaxing and productive; gave me a reason to wake up and enjoy my days on earth (working)!"
good,"Had to carrying out own freight for the department you worked in, highly expected to get a huge portion of merchandise to be done 30 minutes prior to clock out, poor management with an exception of one"
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal Mart! The atmosphere was friendly and positive. I enjoyed learning about what I do and perfecting my craft. Overall, when you are interested in something you will perform well at. I can honestly say I loved it!"
good,"Trabajas bien,el sindicato esta muy presente lo q arruina todo progreso"
good,"Its hard to get full time status but they will give you lots of hours. Great employee perks. Training was long but beneifical to do the job. They do a lot to help employees and give back with lunches, discount, etc. I would work there again however, my back cant handle it."
good,Love my store and the people I work with. Great opportunity to advance really fast.  But Walmart needs to work on the new scheduling system. It is horrible
good,"I worked at three Walmart stores. Two of those stores were in Kansas, and one was in Arkansas. I learned great skills from my time with Walmart, such as inventory management , merchandising, and managerial experience. Management is very hit-or-miss with assignments and professionalism within the company. Managers in smaller, ""hometown"" stores in the company tend to have less drive and commitment to excellence, while bigger stores more carefully acknowledge workplace culture guidelines. The best part of working at Walmart was helping people.Satisfied customers positively affected the bottom line, and helping to the best of my ability was enjoyable.The hardest parts of my career with Walmart really weren't that complicated at all. But without going into complex details, I faced situations to help me become a better manager on a very regular basis."
good,"Walmart has given a lot of people opportunities to grow their career and learn how to be a leader.  This was my first ""real"" job and I learned how to be acceptable, lead people and grow."
good,I like the fact that Walmart has a good insurance plan set up for the associates. Offer full time positions and friendly co workers as well as the customers.
good,"The work was fast paced, challenging and rewarding. The people that work there were the greatest, compassionate and caring. Management staff were all, easy to talk to, easy to follow instructions with. "
good,Has been a great place to work with a lot of opportunities for growth from entry to middle management.  You can really start a great career in retail.
good,I was fortunate to meet a lot of great people while working at Walmart.  Been there have given me the ability to grow as an individual and learned a lot about working in a big environment.
good,Make sure your ok with hard work and doing lots of different job titles. It would of been better if full time and benifits but over all was not a bad job
good,"Upper management was hard to deal with ,but for the most part company was good to work for I wish I would have started with them in there early years before they started with all the rules and guidelines ."
good,Good work environment. Flexible hours. Coworkers are helpful. Management was acceptable. Competitive pay. Job training was accurate. Job security was a major plus.
good,Ambiente cordial. Respetable. Abiertos al diálogo.
good,"Working the cash register and helping customers find their items. That you must work hard to get the benefits of a good company. Management is good. The work environment was great. The hardest thing was work less than 15 hours a week, which made me have to get another job in supporting myself. Meeting new people and getting paid."
good,Working at Walmart has been a good experience. I've met a lot of helpful people. It was very easy for me to get promoted. I've learn lots of different skills. It's a very good work place overall.
good,"estabilidad laboral buena, con exelente plan de creecimiento, salario justo, buen ambiente de trabajo,buenas prestaciones."
good,"es buen trabajo con buen sueldo, pero con preciones laborales."
good,Fast paced environment and always different each day. Hardest  is completing tasks with minimal help. Required to work every holiday except Christmas.
good,"I've been working at Walmart for about 5 months. All I have done while being here is being demoted even though I did not want to. I tried to fight it as well as I could, but they didn't really seem to care very much. But over all, if you get into a place you like, Walmart could be a good place to work."
good,opportunity to work much but are treated more as property than people. Was not shorted on hours but management was not understanding of circumstances and treatment of employees when they are not around.
good,Everyone was welcoming at Walmart. The work was difficult. The environment was very bland. The work is slightly tedious but goes by very quick due to the constant movement and energy used to do the job.
good,Very demanding in a logistic manner.  Having batch schedule to meet deadline on a daily basis. Very structured environment.  Associates have a voice in the way the building operates.
good,"Walmart is a pretty good job, its a nice fast paced job for people who don't like to just hang out in front of computers. The job keeps you busy for most of the day."
good,"Easy to learn and move up the ranks great store with dedicated associates. Needs to be updated for the area, store is old. Many great activities in the area and fine dining."
good,"Was a decent starting job, a good experience builder. I worked inventory, garden, as well as cashier positions. How ever if your transferring to a new Walmart out of state they do not always honor their transfer approvals."
good,"Great place to work at, good people, qnd steady work flow, you knew what to expect each day. Only bad part is some managers or supervisor will break and bend company policy to there benefit and have you fired or moved before any backlash could happen to them"
good,"Working at Walmart had its ups and downs. The ups would be the two minute breaks and 1 hour lunch, you got to decide between which hours you wanted to take them. The downs was probably the work load which was sometimes too much to handle by yourself, but on normal days it was quit easy and fun to stock the items."
good,I think companies like Walmart should be able to pay a little more for what the associates do for them. The work that the employees put in far more than they return in wage or benefits.
good,Aprendí mucho para crecer en el comercio...y son muy bueno respetuoso...y un clima muy agradable
good,"The customers at Wal-Mart keep your job interesting."
good,"I began my employment at Walmart at a time when my husband was out of work.  I started on graveyard shift and because of my work ethic, I was promoted to Department Manager where I was in charge of ordering, design and cleanliness of the office supply department.  The training at Walmart was excellent!"
good,"This is a great place to work. Management is friendly, professional, and upholds the walmart culture and beliefs. They are understanding and helpful. The team assists each other and are team players. The compensation and benefits are reasonable. Training is provided and further training opportunities are provided is wanted or needed."
good,Walmart gives it's associates the oppirtunity to better themselves and to move up in the company. It allows you to choose if you want to stay in the position you are placed or if you want to move to a different department or just up in the department that yiu are already in.
good,"Good place to work for friendliness, customer care, benefits, and workable hours. Wal-Mart works with you when you have disabilities also. They make you comfortable."
good,A typical day at Walmart was focusing on making sure boxes were checked in and inventory was restocked. I have learned at Walmart is definitely independence and time management. Walmart is very diverse different people all around. I enjoyed the people I worked with it can become a family like environment at times.
good,"Help customers,order merchandise, stock product."
good,Agradable pero no crea un equilibrio para tu vida personal y laboral
good,"It's a great job. The only problem I had at the store I worked for, is that they didn't respect privacy. You call to tell management something and by time you make it to work, it has made it to the front end."
good,"Walmart tends to get back reviews. I started in one city with them, and when I decided to move to another city, they transferred me to a store near my new home. When a family member became ill, they put me on FMLA so I could care for the family member. They didn't have to put me on FMLA since I was part-time. They were good enough to do it."
good,"Great for people in all different areas of life. From students to middle aged workers as well as elderly, Something for everyone with fair expectations and goals in mind. Open door policy saves a lot of headache and drama from happening."
good,A typical day would consist of Putaways or in other words inventory stocking. Or you could be doing Replenishments which basically were; making sure pickers had product to pick. Awesome company and a great team to work for.
good,On a typical work day I can expect to see daily regulars and meet new people who quickly become regulars. When I wasn't cashiering I was pushing carts and helping stock shelves. The people I worked with were always great and helpful as well. Management worked with you to help you out and the best part of my day was wrapping things up and seeing how much I actually got done that day.
good,Typical day is assisting customers and cashing them out. Best part of the job seeing the customers face after they get what the needed.  Learned to be fast paced in a busy environment.
good,Good place to work. Fast paced and always changing. I was on the sales floor and enjoyed meeting and talking to customers.its a pleasure to serve customers and be helpful to them.
good,The job itself was stressful. It was alright if you have a lot of perseverance. The management was quite poor. LOTS of favoritism. So give it your all.
good,"Walmart gave me an opportunity to provide customer service, which I really enjoyed. I have been in management for about 7 years and learned a lot about employee relations and how to deal with different situations. Workplace culture is positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was work-life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the community and working alongside some great people."
good,"Overall, I did enjoy working here. It had its ups and downs, but the good did outweigh the bad. Good breaks, good hours, great people, overall a good work environment. If you are looking for something that part-time, with decent hours, and that isn't too difficult then I would recommend applying at Wal-Mart."
good,I loved working for the company but I just hated doing the same thing every day. Management was pretty nice and you sort of came to work and did your own thing.
good,a regular day at work is fun when you are able to interact with people around you and deal with the customers needs. i have learned how to stock shelves and organize the shelves.
good,"En estos 10 años he aprendido muchas cosas, desde reposicion, trabajar en equipo, llevar a cabo diferentes planes de accion comercial. Creo q lo unico q hoy en dia me lleva a pensar en otro lugar para trabajo es tener menos carga horaria."
good,"Wal-Mart is one of the best employers I've worked for because they do accommodate the associates needs regarding scheduling and education. The pay is above the minimum wage as well and based on experience. You're also given two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch, if you're scheduled a full shift which is normally 8-9 hours. No absence is excused regardless the situation, unless it's the death of an immediate family member. There's a point system, once points have been tallied to the max, it causes an immediate termination.  "
good,I like meeting new people and helping them out .it was a great experience for me to learn something new overall great place the hardest part was the machine down and didn't get trained to fix it
good,Pretty good company to work for. Management was understanding and was always helpful when needed. Needed more staff to complete duties that needed to be done though
good,"A good place to work.Normally the shifts are filled with inspections and troubleshooting electrical cabinets, conveyers and automated sorting machines."
good,i love to go to work everyday i like to deal with the customers i always have a good day at work i try to make a positive day everyday i learned how to topstock paaperworks reports inventory as well mamgemant looks out for they employee has an open door policies...the hardest part is not enough help besides thats it fabalous the most enjoyable part of the day is clock out and go home
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Wal-Mart. The staff is friendly, the pay and hours are good, you are always busy so time doesn't drag. I recommend working there."
good,"This company has taught me how to have patience with co-workers and customers. I mostly work in the Tire Lube center changing tires and oil, occasionally a battery or two. When not working on vehicles I spend time in the hardware department, zoning and putting away stock. Over all haven't had many complaints about the store, lovely people to work with and management is easy to get a long with and always understanding."
good,"As an overnight CSM I didn't do too much other than making sure customers were happy and the stockers got all the freight on the shelves. Very simple job, worth the pay, great benefits. Very affordable insurance. Dealing with the day time management was never fun though. Lack of communication and overall rude attitudes lead to a very poorly run establishment. Everybody on the night shift was very easy going for the most part, not too much drama. Typical day would be to come in at 10 pm, no cashiers and the evening CSM already left. I have to clean and ensure the customers get rung up quickly while also helping other customers on the self-checkouts. Before midnight I would make sure that any extra registers were checked into the money recycler and take the money out of the lottery machine. At midnight I would switch over the registers and self-checkouts to start the new business day. Throughout the night I would stock the register aisles, get the carts inside, and put up any re-shop that I found. If the managers needed me to do anything for them, such as stocking or zoning, I would do that for them. Around 3 am I would get an hour for lunch. Around 6 am the first cashier would show up and I would either have them get directly on a register or they would go help finish zoning. I would get off at 7 am, go home, eat, sleep, shower, then go back in at 10 pm. I worked 5 days in a row with 2 days off after. Tuesdays and Wednesdays became my weekend. The hardest part would be that I never got to see my family or friends because I was always sleeping when they were awake. It was hard"
good,I actually enjoyed being a cashier at Wal-Mart.  I just wish they paid more and that customers weren't so rude all the time.  A few managers would ask you to stay longer and if you decline they would sometimes try to use that against you and make your job harder (use favoritism).

At the start of the job I would clock in and sit in the breaker room and the managers would give a motivating speech and tell us about profit margins vs last year's and how good the store looks. Then tell us what area we will be working in for the night how it's looking and what to do. Next work freight and/or zone the Iles of the store. Once done with freight clean up and go to the next thing. I would work 10pm to 7am, 15 minute breaks at 12am and 5am, and lunch from 2am to 3am."

good,"Depending on your position, the typical day varies. If you are a cashier, you do that until you leave with a break every two hours (for a full shift). If you work on the floor, you are given different projects depending on priority and helping cashier when it is busy. You learn great time management skills. The management is good about communicating and getting back to people about inquiries. The workers there are close and refer to themselves as a ""Walmart Family"". The hardest part of the day is deciding which project has priority; if it is a busy day you won't necessarily get all your projects done. The most enjoyable part of my day was being able to know what was expected of me and work without being supervised."
good,"Great healthcare, flexible hours, job security, no problem requesting off when needed with proper time given. Although some management could use more training on how to properly confront an employee on an issue."
good,"Training had alot to wish for but alot of the tasks are self explanatory. Managers are not too strict, but still get work done in a timely manner. i would work for this company again."
good,Empresa boa de se trabalhar ambiente agradavel  gerentes competentes
good,"Like any other job, it does have its boring days. The non-boring ones can get pretty eventful and fun. Your management team can really make or break your experience though."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart when i was there. I was able to meet new people and communicate with all different races of people. It's a good place to work and become more than just a regular associate. My most enjoyable moments were meeting all my customers and giving them great customer service, making sure they leave satisfied. For me being a cashier was an easy and self explanatory to me so there really wasn't a hard part about the job other than calming down customers that was having a bad day . Which isn't a problem for me so , i can't really say there was a hard part about the job. The management there was good , they really cared about their employees. The made sure you knew everything you needed to know before they sent you on the floor. Working at  Walmart I learned that teamwork is the key to getting everything done , you can't do everything on your own."
good,I worked on the toy department and got to see all the new toys for the year. I always got first pick of the Matchbox cars for my son and the newest Barbies for my daughter.

good,Walmart is a great place to work if you need some money coming in. They provide a steady schedule and extra hours if needed.
good,"Pretty simple job, they ask a lot of you but depending on your manager, the job can be kind of relaxed. The company is constantly changing  so keep up with what the company is doing because it can affect your job, or possibly get you fired. If the people in the place is willing to work with you, then no worries. Basically depends on if you're a good worker or not. Do what you came to do and get out of there. Personally, not the best career option, but it can be done."
good,The experience I gained from working at Walmart I will use to achieve my goals at another opportunity. Overall it was a great place to work and I will cherish it.
