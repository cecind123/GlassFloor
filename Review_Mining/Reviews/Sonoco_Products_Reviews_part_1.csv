rating,review
bad,Managers are always worried about the product and dont seem like there there to worry about well being of employees. There is no smoking on property so if your a smoker you have to leave the grounds
bad,"Ótima empresa para trabalhar, pagamento em dia,faz reunião constante com os funcionários sobre segurança do trabalho e etc!"
bad,There lighting is almost 100 percent gonna make you blind and it pretty sad that they don’t even supply you lenses for your hood I had to come out of pocket every few days
bad,"Not a very good place to work the plant manager josh has no manager skill and does sneaky behind your back stuff so there is no raise. And the office lady jody dockery lies on paper work , hours and steals company hours So my advise is not to work for sonoco in Carrollton Ga"
bad,"This place is a joke, they don’t care abou your work life balance and even if you want to move up you better make sure you are considered “cool” to the rest of the people there because it’s like high school all over again with the drama. You’ll be working long hours with no respect from anyone while they literally stand around doing nothing or goof off at work. They will promote someone who knows someone before they promote the person who works hard and has the willingness to move up"
bad,"Working isn't fun at all because their equipment are all scrap and very old.. they don't perform."
bad,"if they dont have a rule for something they will make one up"
bad,I would not recomend anybody to work there the managers dont care about the employees only about how much money they can get. They dont give you paid sick days. You have no retirement fund and they work you 12 hour shifts 5 days a week.
bad,The job was ok at first but the person over ateendece was not capable of doing there job was accused of missing 20 day when in reality I missed 3 besides that it was decent job
bad,do not work in that place they do not have good benefits the bosses are Mexican and they do not want to let people only do they want they do not have good benefits they only help those who are family or friends of the supervisors those are the ones who have better positions do not have sickdays they only give a 2.5 percent of your increase check per year work or not that is what they give they are always pressing you for that they are looking for people because they are not going to because they are not good
bad,New management took over a year ago and had to go over their head several time to get issues resolved which seemes to upset the new plant manager it was a hard job streuous and very hot
bad,they lack a lot skills and they don't respect anyone they really didn't wont do the job the right way and never honest eith people as they should be not a good a job
bad,sonoco recycling is the worst place to work they make you work in below zero temperture they pay is herrrible you work 70 to make a god check i wouldnt advise anyone to work there
bad,Very bad experience night manger was horrible no one never listen about him very rude never had anything nice to say to anyone choose who he likes and dislikes
bad,"The machinery is so out of date they cannot repair it, nor are they even attempting to. Constantly run out of parts and supplies, just this week we ran out of resin to extrude. No accountability whatsoever. The list is endless as to why they will never fill these positions."
bad,have you work for 14 hours and dont care about your body or anything will never work for them again will never tell a friend or a family member to work for them
bad,I managed a crew of my own. Conducted safety seminars and worked very closely with my team. The hardest part of my job was any time I had to deliver any bad news to my employees. The most enjoyable moments were the days I was a great motivator to my team.
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,Work place was a very energetic and caring environment. Employees always eager to learn knew skills. I managed a crew of Ten or more on the daily basis. From day to day basis I performed a variety of skills and task which lead to a great production report.
bad,"Very demanding employer, Everyday is stressful, quality is poor, equipment is old. Mechanics don't fix anything so it makes the job even more difficult."
bad,Typical day included overseeing the quality of products on my shift but often being ignored when I would bring quality concerns to my supervisors.
bad,"Fast paced work and overwhelming workloads, no balance between work and personal life, working with heavy machinery and need to be  aware for personal safety."
bad,not the best place no one looks out for anything it a warehouse look be for you move never would work there anymore and the boss is always late
bad,"Does not matter how long you worked there or how hard/good you did your job. More like ""popularity"" contest. Like being back in high school. Not a ""yes man"" so did not go over well with new management. They say they want to ""grow employees"" NOT true."
bad,"I would not recommend any one to work here they spend more time trying to find what an employ may have done wrong instead of working on things that should be important to the company's benefit example : New Supervisor did not last 2 months because of the fact they spent more time running her down for not writing teammates up for anything  Instead of the Improvements that have been made. They do not have good benefits and could care less what's going on,  The hard working employs they treat disrespectfully So they lose them and the bad ones they promote ...Confusing!"
bad,"The work it’s self is not hard, fairy easy but can be fast paced and frustrating. The supervisor only cares about production, that’s understandable but when it’s comes to the hard worker nobody seems to care. I did not care for this workplace because the superiors did not care for the workers. If you do want to work here... Good Luck."
bad,This place is a sweat shop.  You would better off to go work for devil  himself. Managers are worthless and do nothing to keep certain employees in line they do and say anything they want.
bad,"high turnover, poor communication, outdated processes, uneducated people in managerial positions. punish people for low production :( "
bad,"It was a great job at one time untill the shipping and receiving management took over the recycling department, after that it went down hill , after three years the employees had a Christmas bonus that went from 30 to 300 a piece which was steady climbing when management took over demoting employees and miss handling the inventory the just was to stressful to continue to work there but over all it was a great experience"
bad,This facility only has one real customer And the management is doing absolutely nothing to keep up with the current demand of this customer they can't even reach a 77% delivery rate when their only customer wants to grow by 15% in the next 5 years The machinery that this company has is so outdated the quality of the product delivered is embarrassing Management is so one sided and plays favorites there is absolutely no chance for career advancement My advice to you is if you're thinking about working care think twice as long jabbity of your job will be very short lived thanks to a very narrow minded Inept do nothing who no accountability for your own mistakes Managers
bad,"I did not enjoy this job at all due to the fact that I was not able to work enough hours to cover my daily expenses. co-workers and managers were rude and it seemed like there was always workplace drama going on. There was no chance to advance in that career, a lack of benefits, and a poor pay rate considering the work that was done."
bad,"I worked at Sonoco for a year and a half. The management was awful, everything was always breaking or falling apart due to faulty equipment. Manager was almost always late, yet employees couldn't even be 1 minute late or else it counted as a quarter of an absence. The coworkers of mine were a joke, lazy and good for nothing. I was motivated to work hard for over a year, gave the place 110%, kept trying to get a lead position and learned how to do the leads job, even filled in for leads several times but manager never would move me up. My newborn son died while working for this company and when I came back in from FMLA leave the manager suspended me for being 3 minutes late the day before my son died and I was only late because I was giving a coworker a ride because he had lost his license. Then after my son dying and serving my 3 day suspension and after venting to a coworker about the company suspending me during that time the coworker goes and tells the manager I was talking bad about the manager and 5 minutes after clocking in from my suspension the manager is trying to suspend me again for ""talking bad"" about him. I told him I was having a hard time and was mad at everything at the time, he said there was no excuse for talking poorly about Sonoco. I quit and would never recommend this sorry excuse of a company to anyone. A complete joke. I'd take McDonald's over Sonoco, at least they will promote those who go above their job description."
bad,Management forces the maintenance dept. to hold the equipment together with duct tape and bailing wire.
bad,odnosnie zakladu Sonoco  praca nie byla zla  zalezalo od danej maszyny i operatorow
bad,durante todo el turno ahy bastante trabajo eso es bueno ya que con esto aprendes algo nuevo cada dia desde como revisarlo hasta implementacion de nuevas tecnicas.
bad,Management refused to award promotions and raises that were earned in a clearly defined promotion system.  No advancement.  Very hostile management outlook.
bad,The plant manager is horrible!!! The union is even worse they do not help you at all!!!! The pay is great but very strict rules and a lot of  dictatorship every day there’s a new rule
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,"Whatever position you’re  hired is were you stay. Safety first, is the most important thing. Pay sucks, low raises and a lot of favoritism. Underpaid."
bad,Didnt enjoy this job. Line leader always yelling at you. They would not respect you. That cuss and fuss at you on the line in front of other workers. If they didnt like you they wouldn't let you work.They will send you home after waiting 30 minutes to hour in a line for work.
bad,"Management are headhunters. watching your every move. Focused on safety, but create issues in the work place that are dangerous."
bad,This place lacks management communication that causes a lot of stress to those working on the floor. No proper training programs. No matter how hard you work there is no incentive or words of encouragement.  The ones working the the floor have more knowledge about the containers then management.
bad,You never knew what press you'll be working on or if they would send you home. Equipment would break down or they would'nt order enough material to run machines but would stress productivity.
bad,Ran a weekly payroll and had to submit it to home office through a wire.  The office manager was a very rude individual so it made it a very difficult to work there so people were always quitting or getting fired.  Friday's at quitting time was the best time and going back to the office on Mondays was the hardest.
bad,Typical work day running production.
bad,dealing with customers wonderful people you work with unsafe
bad,"Total disbelief how a company can be so poorly exist  in  USA. This company produce foam automotive parts that is non-compliance with OSHA, or adhere by any State of TN Labor, IRS Tax or ISO compliance law. "
bad,"Terrible Management, Terrible benefits, High paced, High stress, High Physical Labor, Terrible Pay. "
bad,Fast pace get in get out type of work i will say tht they will work with u but it dust place work with molded plugs and wood 3 plant they have machine operator recyling and steel plant
bad,"There are aspects of the job that are okay, overall it is not a very good place to work. Management is very shady not very involved in the day to day operations."
bad,"im work this for 1 1/2 year the management is not good free board but we deduction every month,no good relation to other foreign worker.very bad employee staff."
bad,They don’t give you vacation time right away and then when they do it’s so hard to use them. When you call out they have a point system that keeps up with your days out and it is just past ridiculous. Not fair company at all.
bad,"The annual raise u get is only 3% poor management, no communication and can stand to pay alot more, liars, boring environment to work, unsanitary place to work"
bad,"Run , don’t walk away. "
bad,"The supervisors, trainers, maintenance & people on b crew are horrible. All these people care about is money! 60-84 hour weeks are common, even though they tell you in orientation that they work 36/48 hours with MAYBE one OT day. The seniority list is ridiculous, you can have more seniority than a person and will not get the day you signed for & when you talk to the supervisors about it, it’s oh better luck next week. HR is wack If you work night shift. You would have to schedule a meeting with her & how can you if she doesn’t answer the phone!"
bad,Poor Management lack of work Plant manager only cares about One person in the whole operation and that's the front office Clerk the most enjoyable part of the is production floor employees
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,This company is outdated in it's inventory management.  Everything is entered by hand and is relied upon handwritten production reports from individual operators. Incorrect illegible production counts causing discrepancies in inventory. This causes multiple issues. Company is stressful to work. Manager has his own indivdual scheduling ideas for labor that causes poor morale among staff.
bad,"Lack of communication,new hires treated like there garbage by machine operators who are overly worked and pushed to run there product.  Operators lack verbal communication to over see that new hires understand the operations and positon of there job.  They run top speed on the lines and do not slow down and place new hires on this line. They get mad if it's your first night even and make a mistake and do not explain how to not make the mistake again.  Some of these operators are very rude.  And does not make since to take a new hire and run them on the fastest machine they have.  Instead of having them on a slower line to start off with and get familiar with how the operations and procedures run. This leads to confusion,mistakes,wasted product and down time or possible injuries for failer of making sure the people understand what is exspected of them.  It does not have to be that way.  But seams they care more about there products and production then the people they have working for them. Even though they push safety-seams to me there setting themselves up for a fall.  and great turn-over."
bad,"Given that most general labor positions start at the slave wage of $10 or less, starting at $13.42 wasn't that bad. Buy after that, you will be put on whatever shift they please while 1st shift is reserved for the manager's sons. Definite favoritism at play here by the manager, supervisor, and even human resources. Certain workers are more often assigned easier tasks while you are stretched thin. You'll run up to 3 or 4 presses at a time (up to 9 parts) and while you struggle to keep up, other workers and especially the lazy supervisor will lounge around. The supervisor, who can be often seen sitting in his office chatting with one of the more favored employees, will scold you for not keeping up with the inhuman task that you have been assigned. He will even tell you to your face to not stand around and do nothing when only he was the one doing so. This is a decent job when you know it is temporary, but don't stay longer than you have to."
bad,"I worked there for ! year and it got shut down, it paid pretty good and management treated the hourly employees well"
bad,"aprendi bastante a trabalhar em equipe, a ter mais segurança técnicas para produzir com total qualidade e agilidade"
bad,"Very rough area to be in for work. Customers don't have any respect for a human being. They are not humble at all. However, I serve each and every one of them with pleasure, respect and dignity. In addition, I get along with all my coworkers, I care about, and make sure they do what is right. I enjoy every minute I spend in my shift."
bad,6 months after a promotion I am told that my position is no longer in the budget.
bad,"It doesn't matter what you do here, all the jobs are basically the same unless you work maintenance. Everyone pretty much starts out as a packer/ inspector. Operators abuse their breaks and are rarely seen unless something is wrong with the extruders, there's a material change, or they're recording routine paperwork. The job is extremely simple though and it doesn't take any concentration to do the job after a couple of months. Don't expect to get hired on if you go through a temp agency... your best bet is to wait for them to attend a job fair and apply directly to the plant."
bad,Cutbacks and layoffs of long term good employees who were more than meeting and fulfilling their job descriptions. Big corporation uncaring attitude towards the same people.
bad,"You clock in, sit in a meeting for 10-15 mins only to find out you have to work 6-13 12 hour days in a row. The cool guy who trained you either got fired or quit because he wanted to spend time with his family. To say this place has a high turn over rate is an understatement and the Overtime is high because of it. You'll make decent wages working here, but you will not have a life outside of it. If you do go for this job, just show up, work safely, and tell your family you love em'. I've even heard they fired a guy for silly reasons because a family member was sick."
bad,"The company itself is good but the Putnam location is going downhill. Lucky to get 40 hours a week, pushed to the max for a cap of $16 per hour. No room for advancement. Management is strict, contradicts each other, makes people obsolete, and refuses to do what they say they will."
bad,"I heard someone actually say something racist & when I brought it up to management they just ""swept it under the rug"" they'll repramand you for actually trying to help out & get things done, people like to tattle tell on you like there above the rules, yet they get away with breaking rules at the same time, a bunch of company suck ups, if it ain't white it ain't right is their culture."
bad,"Very hot, Poor management, lack of repair parts, most all machinery is over 25 years old and unsupported by manufacturer. Dust collection systems are poorly maintained and creates a dust explosion hazard. Previous updates and repairs to electrical cabinets are undocumented and in disarray."
bad,I Would Go In Get On My Forklift Start Grabbing pallets I need out the steel . Also I would That the pallets to the Dofferent lines that’s inside Duracell Warehouse. Everything was Great everyday Til one of the Head People Feel they can Talk to you any kind of way
bad,"nikomu nie polecam pracy w tym zakladzie.panuje chaos ,polacy gorzej traktowani niz ukraincy."
bad,"A typical Day at Sonoco Corflex was very fast paste, training all nationalities to do one job for huge companies! "
bad,Management has issues and the plant's safety record is questionable.  Major reorganization in 2017 due to disagreements within the plant and with the way employees were treated.
bad,This company has many opportunities if you're willing to work extremely hard and not have a life outside of work. This company has unreasonable expectations and is not loyal to loyal employees.
bad,ok job for someone who just got out of prison and cant get anything else! however if that's not your situation I recommend you avoid this place like the plague.
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,"All aspects of a busy needed to be dealt with quickly and efficiently."
bad,This Company has a very strong internally embedded company culture and holds a significant number of meetings and discussions prior to moving forward or taking action.
bad,"Low pay. Expected to work overtime constantly. Cannot make plans for weekends ever. On call 24/7. Only one break in 8 hours. If you work 12 hours you can have an extra 10 minutes in between shifts. Hot!!!!! No air at all. Cannot sit down,,,,, at all. Only on your break."
bad,"Management will toss you under the bus in a heart beat. Tried to get the union in the plant and management bought off the votes by giving raises."
bad,This was a good company to get started with but over the years I had work extremely hard (because I am a female) to work my way up. They pay was alright but getting anymore pay would require more abilites and these abilites were not offered. This is a very stressful place to work and alot of hours.
bad,Friendly employees but issues with management and no communication between supervisors and leads and employees. They are unfair on how they treat employees.
bad,"When it comes down to it after working here one day, you will not want to come back. The job itself is easy but the restrictions are ridiculous, management is ""king"" and blame others for problems. Co workers are cliques in disquse. The benefits are decent which was nice. Other than that this place was truly unappealing."
bad,Manager continually took credit for my work and ideas.  Deserving women were denied promotions and pay increases equal to men even when performance appraisal scores were equal.
bad,"If you can eat beans for 3 months, and live with a friend you might make it here. Poor starting wages. Company preaches safety but it is all hype, make parts for high dollar companies, but get paid low wages. Cool safety awards but don't report on job injury. Looks great on paper but the wages are sub par. Slave type factory work. Unless they bring up wages do not waist your time here.  Trust me."
bad,Management sucks and everyone hates them. Been understaffed for about two years so been crazy overtime. 12 hour days frequently staying over and coming in early
bad,"During my interview, I was told alot of great potential things .But , they were all talk, it seems as if only managers and  supervisors get raised. I have been with the company for over a year and only received thirty cent raise.They have taken away bonus, and company cook outs. It's a perty picture but as I say ,its only a picture that will fade away. This is the Jefferson Tx plant"
bad,"They’re really unorganized. Working in production plant for years this one took me by surprise. They stress safety a little too much, but they’re machines are a little outdated."
bad,"Hot environment, bad smells frequently throughout the day, sorting through trash & required to work quickly & efficiently as if you have years of experience after only being employed 2 weeks"
bad,People I work with are great management is horrible they could careless if you have a life outside of work or not and position could change week to week depending on call offs and people that quit
bad,trabajo con seguridad siempre se preocuparon por la seguridad
bad,good company with a ton of rules to follow. some of the work don't let you take a break or lunch at times other times you can. supervision is very young
bad,"Słaba organizacja pracy, stresowanie pracowników, wymuszanie nadgodzin, nieregularne czasy posiłków, przerw lub wcale ich nie ma. Trzeba o każdą swoją potrzebę się prosić, braki w wyposażeniu na stanowiskach pracy."
bad,I've worked for sonoco phoenix almost 5 years now and I can honestly say its been the worst 5 years of my life. I was hired in as a technician in 2008 and was told that overtime was optional and there was a great training program for new employees. Nothing but lies! I started off working 6 days a week 10 hours a day. Which I didn't mind at first but it never stops. The scheduling is so unpredictable and usually 6 or 7 days a week with 2 or 3 twelve hour days mixed in. This only happens to the people working on the production floor and when you voice your concern about it they are quick to let everyone know that they do not care about your life or your health. As far as training on equipment that I was highly uneducated on how to run. I was pretty much just thrown on a line and was told to figure it out? It sounds ridiculous considering their overboard safety program. The safety program is so overwhelming that you become afraid to do anything at all. The management is a complete joke! They bring guys from the floor into a supervisors role and they don't know much about supervision. Sonoco forces them to enforce rules and write people up even when the supervisor does not fully understand the rules or why he's writing you up. You almost have to have a really good sense of humor if you want to work for sonoco. So for the final nail in the coffin. Like I said I was hired as a tech and have been forced to pack numerous times which wasn't terrible until they forced me to do it for top packer rate which was a cut for me and a few other techs forced to do the same. Sonoco over hired
bad,"To many things to list . Management and clicks . Working conditions as far as management . Like safety , cleanliness , ppe , all is well overboard . We have no one to be on our side as it is non union .So it is do as we say or find a new job type attitude. Very very stressful place to work . Don't care about working their employees 7 days a week with a few 12 hour days included in the mix . sometimes working 30 days or more in a row . And they talk about safety ?"
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,"Worst place to work, management has favoritism. More concerned over rules than employees. Has gotten worse. Some decent people still work there. But stay way. Can find a better place around the corner. These companies are big corp. Concentrating on profits than their workers."
bad,"Hot hot hot, management dosent care about u at all, your just a  clock number in there eyes, they work u till your to the point of falling asleep at work. 8-16 hr days shift work long hat hard days. Pay is the only reason that place stays going if they didn’t pay so good everyone would walk out"
bad,"It was not the best job, 12-hour shifts when I worked there and only 2 5 min breaks and one 20 min lunch.  However, a lot could have changed there its been a while."
bad,While I was at Sunoco for almost 11 years it did provide my family with stability and a paycheck with decent insurance but it got to the point that I no longer could tolerate management and their extremely bad decisions!!!
bad,"It's ungodly hot, upwards of 110 degrees sometimes. The roof is always leaking water. Management and team leads show A LOT OF FAVORTISM!!! Work 6 days a week and mandatory overtime. No time for a family life with the way they change your shedule last minute. All about safety looking good on paper, but not actually doing things to keep us safe. Like fixing machines, trying to control the heat, fixing the roof. Not enough space so it's very crowded, no oven space, always running out of racks for parts, etc.. no sick days and made to feel bad if you do need to call in."
bad,its a good job just very fast pace at all times but a very easy job people a very willing to work with you and am not asked to work a lot of overtime
bad,Weird schedule. I wouldn't recommend to this job to a friend or family member especially if they have family. Job takes away a lot of time from ones family.
bad,It was 10 hours a day packaging and shipping equipment and it is the easiest job I ever had. The co workers were rude and it was not enjoyable.
bad,Like a lot of companies...their are a lot of people (including management) are unwilling to do their jobs and the company chooses to not do anything about it.
bad,"This review is based on a temp position through an employment agency and does not reflect upon full-time permanent employment with Sonoco. Primarily a Packaging and Display company providing services for various companies, Sonoco's main labor personnel is acquired through an employment agency. Full-time, permanent employment is reserved for Management or Supervisory positions. The workload required by Sonoco on a day to day basis can vary. For this reason, the employment agency maintains a ""pool"" of potential employee's to be sent out to the jobsite according to need. This varying need creates a situation where they maybe understaffed at times or the opposite, more people have reported to work than is needed. If there are more people than are required, those people, unfortunately, are told to return the next day to see if they will be placed on a line, no guarantee. Employees are encouraged to report to work everyday however this structure does not always translate to employees being placed everyday, which creates uncertainty. On the other side is the fact that if you are placed on a regular basis and your performance is at an acceptable level, you ""can"" be placed as a regular or ""primary"" on a line. Meaning you would be considered for placement before ""non-primaries"". At best, this assignment is ideal for those with some flexibility in availability, given their individual resources (i.e. transportation, travel time, etc.) accommodate this structure. At worst you're spending more resources to report for work than being compensated for. "
bad,Productive
bad,"too much dosh aroaund building, but they have safety protection for employee, potential hazardous all the time, good peoples to work with, need to motive employee."
bad,"If you’re young, and fresh in the workforce this is an ideal place. For the older crowd it’s nothing but a burden. On top of your actual job, you often have to stay late or come in early to deal wit the headache of duties surrounding whatever safety committee your a part of. Safety is more important than the actual job which why so many things don’t go the way it should...I don’t work there anymore , sooooo"
bad,Good place to work but management isn't the best. Do not listen to employees. Over book and scheduling management isn't so good. Other than that it's a good place with some good people.
bad,It pays good but wouldn't recommend anyone with a family life to work here. Other than working all the time it is an ok job. Also it's not climate controlled so the Summer's are very hot.
bad,"It is an okay job if you stay to yourself or find the right people to be around. There are always relationships, drugs floating around, and things brought to the workplace that people should leave at home."
bad,"If u don't like seeing 100,s of RATS, then this is not the place for u . If u don, like fowl smells , then this is not the place for you. If you don,t like standing on hard surfaces , then this is not the place for you."
bad,"the job is hard work, but if you did not have a job it would be much harder. the culture is really fast pace if you cant keep up your lost. the pay is the worst minimum wadge."
bad,"The problem with Sonoco Display and Packaging is that they care nothing for the temporary line workers that work at the plant. In addition there is heavy favoritism for a specific couple people and anyone who doesn't agree with every word the managers have to say is wrong. There is no reward for a job well done, I spent over a year with them, did some specialized work for them and as soon as that was done I got told by my temp agency that they had canceled my contract."
bad,"If you like being involved with Cliques, you will be rewarded. Simply working hard and doing your job helping out others will get you no where with this company. Focus is on anything but work and standards of accountability only apply to those who are outside the clique."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,"I was hired along with 2 other employees and was the first to complete training. I was promised to have first choice of what schedule to work since I completed training first. I chose second shift. Upon the last mandatory training day of 1st shift, the maintenance technician told me that the I start 3rd shift on Sunday night. I was highly upset. I tried to approach the operations manager about why was I appointed to 3rd shift even after being told I would start 2nd shift on Monday. The operations Manager kept avoiding me for the next 2 months in which I quit because I was offered a better position elsewhere. Low level employees had good work ethic and were honest. Management however, back stabbed many employees so they wouldn't get in trouble themselves."
bad,"muito ruim pós trabalhávamos em pé e a direção era muito iguinorante "
bad,Was promised to work on second shift by the operations manager but then he didn't have the decency to tell me in person that I start 3rd shift after training. He avoided me for almost 2 months before I quit.
bad,"No standard operating procedures."
bad,you do not matter to the company in any way.  you are a number and the ones that mess around get more credit than the ones that try hard.
bad,"Sonoco isn't a bad place to work, I just feel like they don't show  appreciation to hard work and dedication the employees give."
bad,Sonoco is a place that you learn workplace culture.  Operations differs from day to day and that gives you an opportunity to because efficient with many different identifiable information.  The hardest part of the job was going on the floor in such extreme weather conditions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,Good job if you don't have a life outside of work. Management is a joke. Would still be there if they cared about thier employees as much as they claim to
bad,Decent place to work at. Fair pay. Good benefits. Over time required most weeks. 8-12 hrs shifts. Sometimes stressful. Not considerate of home-life...
bad,"Unreasonable expectations for overtime at this company for production employees. "
bad,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. This place has the potential to be a great place to work if they weed out the BAD which will never happen. Night shift is like middle school. Only thing missing is a yellow bus...sad place for an ADULT. It’s stressful enough that you hardly get to see your family. Then you have to go to “work” at a daycare with GROWN children.
bad,no one knows what there doing everyone will tell you something different to the same question. you cant request time off until your 90days is up. what about my kids appointments? what about taking my animals to the vet? you have to call in and say your sick (one of the hr ladys told me this)
bad,"A typical day at work was fairly easy but boring, standing on a line packing parts into a tote for about two hours a piece in an eight hour shift. Occasionally a supervisor might come up and point out something wrong."
bad,"working 80hrs a week is pretty normal ,, there is no lack of overtime forced upon u here ,, pay is average."
bad,"Corporate greed is the best way to describe present day Sonoco. 20 years ago, good starting pay, good benefits, and rarely any turnover. Present day, cut pay in half for new hires, have to pay dearly for health care, and turnover is bad."
bad,"12 hour days, constant overtime, few days off. I was there many years. Learned a lot about the process for quite a few of those years. A lot of turn over. Stressful to long term employees with higher expectations of new employees. Should be able to learn at a fast pace if applying. Most of the line employees are good people to work with. Management could be engaged with floor employees more.General feeling of being ""over pressured"" to perform throughout daily shift. Often, this causes unrest on production floor."
bad,"I was a temp."
bad,"They pay you well, but also lead by false pretenses. They will tell you your production numbers matter, but it's just a ploy to get you to push the temps underneath you to work harder. (You will have to get creative to figure out ways to push your people to the limit for $7.75/hr. And they know you make much more, so you also have to keep this in mind when asking someone to do an insane task, and like it.)"
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,"I only have this to say about the company I wasted 3 years of my life giving all I had to. As great as they think they are, and have no problem boasting about that. There is no position or benefit, perk, compensation or otherwise that would draw me back to that HECK hole. And I'm a happy man now leaving was the best career decision I ever made for myself."
bad,"Was hard work at first but i got use to it.Learned how to pack other things beside cookies and socks.Management was fair. Wasn't there long enough to learn any history but overall a decent place to work. the hardest part of the job was wearing steel toe boots.For myself, the best part of the jobs was learning different things and being off on the weekend."
bad,The ethics here weren't great and the training program is garbage. Also has poor accountability and organization. This job was mostly damage control instead of prevention.
bad,Back stabbing co-workers and bosses who you cannot trust. I would not recommend this work environment to anyone. No family time and no consideration even for a death in the family.
bad,"The culture at the time was interesting,  very rigid,  not accustom to change or new ideas.  Pay was ok at the time,  my personal commute was terrible,  the main reason I left."
bad,"They dont care at all about you. Just that you show up to work. No dress code management doesn't handle issues at all. They hide injuries from OSHA. Not clean. Dust, spider webs everywhere."
bad,"Sonoco is a huge company that offers great compinsation for salaried employees. However hourly employees get a small 2% across the board raise yearly, not based off performance. They don’t offer sick days, and even with a doctors note you have to take a sock on points if you are sick. The computer programs are low cost and ineffective for some plants that cause problems whithin inventory, that make it hard to send and receive shipping"
bad,Sonoco Plastics was a very challenging place to work. A typical day there was twelve hours long and you stood in one spot to inspect bottles coming out of a machine. Most of the time there was always problems with the bottles so u had to go get someone to shut off the machine and then wait for a mechanic to come and fix the problem. Sometimes the problem wouldnt get fixed so u would have to do this over and over again. Overall I wouldn't recommend Sonoco for a place of employment.
bad,"Long hours, Great pay. Somewhat good health package. Some management was good to work for. Monthly bonuses. More for a single person due to long work hours"
bad,Sonoco overall was a great place to work. When I started in 1996 it was an awesome job with exceptional management. Then over the years the management of the company declined drastically. They quit caring about the employees and started treating them as just another number. This was a culture change that myself along with many others found unacceptable for which the reason we decided to pursue other job opportunities.
bad,It was far to fast paced for me. I also am short and the job requires to reach high places. That's why I quit so early. The hours also didn't work very well with my schedule at that moment in time.
bad,"Mam codziennie swoja stala linie na ktorej pracuje z innymi pracownikami , a gdy sie nie ma swojej linii czlowiek musi stac pod sciana i czekac az ktos go zabierze na swoja linie , moim zdaniem tam nie ma co pracowac dlugo poniewaz sa niskie zarobki a podwyzek nie daja ,1zł wiecej za pierwszy miesiac czyli 9zł na godzine , do tego pisza z agencji sms w jakie dni czlowiek pracuje takze nie raz sie pracuje po 3 dni w tygodniu  , a ja po prostu wiem ze zasluguje na wiecej i sie tam tylko marnuje niepotrzebnie. W tej pracy nic takiego trudnego nie ma , jedynym duzym minusem jest psujacy sie sprzet , np. oklejarka. Ludzie ktorzy tym zarzadzaja nie bardzo sie przejmuja pracownikami np , gdy jest goraco na hali to nie robia przerwy i maja to gdzies , dopiero jak bedzie kolo 30 stopni . i co chwile szukaja by sie do czegos doczepic."
bad,The people dont want to show you anything the managers are no help either even if you ask for help you have to learn everything on your own and the company laid you off often
bad,"It’s a good job for someone who doesn’t have anything to do ... 12 hr days 36-60 hrs every week. The people are messy , so be prepared to get bombarded with dumb/personal questions. The benefits are great & the pay is too ... but it does come at a price. You either loose time with family or your sanity with this job."
bad,Sonoco was all right to work at but having to use your vacation time when you sick. Writing up people for being sick is not very good. Doing a higher level job after a year in training and not getting paid for it.
bad,the job really wasnt a good job.. you really didnt know if you was going to work or not and when you did work it was hot...but when you didnt work you wasted gas!
bad,"They pay ludicrously well, but expect you to live for work.  Supervisors will hold it against you if you can't cover a 12 hour shift at a moments notice."
bad,Alot of long time employees that are willing to help make you a better employee and help you get ready for advancement. Safety is very important part of working at sonoco.
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
bad,"Sonoco is not the place everyone thinks it is, a typical day starts out with supervisors not knowing what needs to be done for the day. next I have learned a lot of new skills since I started working for them. Work vs time home work comes out on top many times I have worked 4 to five weeks 12hrs a day with no day off."
bad,I didn't like it but I needed the money for my son.  You have to move at a fast pace be cause it's a line factory.  You also have to be able to pick up a certain amount of lbs.
bad,The job is super simple. The only thing is their work conditions and sometimes you may not have work at all but you wouldn't find out till you go up there cause they don't not make calls to fore warn you so you wouldn't waste gas.
bad,"Everything at Sonoco is based on years of service not on ability. So as long as you work there as an A employee you can be passed by for promotion by an C employee. The ""Managers"" there have to call HQ for rulings and what to do's they don't have the ability to form own opinions or think for themselves. Very strange management techniques IMO"
bad,"Ever since Sonoco bought out the company I work for and the Sonoco merge has come to finalization, all the things that used to make the company fun to work for have gone away. Safety bonuses, production bonuses, company Christmas party, Thanksgiving gift cards, perfect attendance bonuses, etc are now gone. Sonoco has turned this place around and added more jobs, but at what cost? Morale here is at an all time low. Hopefully things change and we see more employee appreciation  but I doubt it. It's  basically come to work get paid and go home."
bad,Good job and benefits its a federal job just Its fast paced and short hours Good job if ur in skool or a part time but nota full time
good,"Worked as a temp for almost 6 months and when they were asked about a hire in date it was a run around. The bosses up front will lie to you about hire in dates and never be up front about it. The hours vary by who comes to work and who doesn't, overtime is all the time, and there is no family life."
good,no benifits at all. no job security. away from family to long.
good,"Did not have enough work to keep busy all the time, "
good,Being a Quality Assurance Analyst is a good job at Sonoco. You are constantly busy so it makes the 12 hours go by faster. You can work at your own pace as long as the work is done.
good,You are only getting paid $8.00/hr and for the work you’re doing I do not believe that is a fair compensation. The management is very mediocre and doesn’t seem like they’re doing their best job as far as being on the same page rule wise and on how to deal with the employees socially.
good,Sonoco used to be a decent place to work but current management has run it in to the ground. HR and all department management play clear favorites and no one has a real understanding of what the day to day processes are supposed to look like. Employee morale is nonexistent and the atmosphere is borderline hostile. Team leads scramble to do their jobs with no back up from salaried management. Operators are given no direction. Every day is a mess. The pay scale for job promotions is a joke and the treatment you’re given as you move up the ladder (if you can) is a nightmare.
good,"Do not be judgemental on how a person look, dress and speak. Most of the time, looks is only an outward shell. Their dress may be of a chosen faith or belief, their speech or quietness maybe an upbringing."
good,"underpaid for all the stuff I have to know and do, basicly doing supervisor work for entry level pay (minimum wage) and they make you wait a whole year to take any kind of vacation, its hard to advance in the company"
good,Work 8 to 14 hrs 5 to 6 days a week. On call on weekends. No training program for new hires or newly promoted people. Expected to take up slack for lack of personel and lack of training without letting my own job duties slip. Get one 15 to 30 min break per 8 to 14 hr shift which is illegal but if you cause an investigation you get paid then fired the first mistake you make. When off trying to spend time with family they will run your cell phone & pager battery dead daily! Everyone gets the same raise whether you do just enough to keep from getting fired or you are the hardest worker in the company.
good,"Start off with temp service.  First you make boxes.  That's right, making boxes.  I did it for two months before training on the lines.  After being on the line for a while you'll want to make boxes.  The work is fast paced (depending on the line) and it is always hot.  Hairnet, long sleeves, and beard nets required.  In all respect this job should be paying way more than it does.  At least 18.00 an hour to start.  On your feet all shift.  People are diverse and most never get a long.  Mucho gossip.  Promises galore but no reward."
good,"management here are interested in moving up and out of here. All advancement is based on how much you brown nose bosses . They are more interested in that , than hard work ethic"
good,"I am working assembly job.making box follow the MSD book and cheking product like leaking,loose,weight,measurment.working place net and clean,follow safety.wear personal protective equipment like gloves safety glassess, steeltoe shoe."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"It was a job nothing grand about it, your normal southern states area employment. Pay was nothing to brag about but, it paid. The management were honest people, and tried to do for you what they were allowed. It would get you by."
good,"work 12hour shifts, every one is upset over management, how things are run and set up, some weeks work 7days 12 hours. The people with the most seniority ruin it for the new workers and management makes alot of there decisions based on there comments and gossip."
good,"They require a lot of overtime.  Communication is seriously lacking.  During the busy season they require a lot of 10 hour days, six and seven days a week.  The managers are not good at communicating or following up on issues and or concerns of employees."
good,it is a decent job but the structure of management is very poor way to many chiefs and not enough Indians very stressfull workplace
good,"Sonoco Corflex (the company) I honestly appreciate. They are the ones that provided my check for the work that I've done. "
good,Everyday was different so there was no boredom. I learned a lot in my years there. Little to no advancement opportunities.
good,"Leuk gezellig leuke collegas veel geleert"
good,"It is an ok place to work as long as you don't mind being alone and not talking to people, they ones that have been there the longest are rude and stare at everyone is hateful looks. But it is a job and it pays ok"
good,"Although the company did pay well as far as the base pay, they were always cutting production rates as fast as you could achieve more production quantities"
good,Business has extreme cycles of growth and reduction in personal with multiple layoffs. That's all I have to say. There is nothing else I want to say I am just trying to get this to move forward without giving me another error.
good,"the employees were very friendly, It was a fast working job. I learned line operation skills"
good,Clean rooms do laundry help in the kitchen. the hardest part staying on the ship for weeks at a time. the most enjoyable part meeting so many different cultures.
good,"Enter work, clock in 5min till work hour. go to station, wait for work detail, go to position, begin work. the job was not hard at all. being in hot heat and then cold air in winter, was the hardest part. tryin not to get sick. superviser and co workers were very friendly and easy to work with."
good,Went thru numerous plant manager changes and floor supervisor changes. They always promoted girls that have no experience in being a supervisor over others that have experience
good,Sonoco is a union plant. The pay is good but everyone puts in a lot of overtime.  It requires a lot of mandatory overtime. A person can make as much as they want to make but will have to work a lot of overtime.
good,No comment at the moment. Really dont have anything to say. It's a descent company to work for the environment is extremely hot in the summer. They keep water in the fridge.
good,"Had good and bad points,but I was promised more hourly once the production rate met a certain %,and never received any increase."
good,"good time I learn a lot"
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,Very active everyday with repeative tasks on a production line. That it takes teamwork to complete goals for the day. Managers were intense on meeting the projected goals. There were alot of very hard working multi-ethnic groups. Some of the tasks caused numbness and pain in your hands and arms. I enjoyed the job getting done. Also the co-workers were enjoyable to be around.
good,This is a fair place to work at. There was plenty of opportunity to make long hours. The work is at a moderate pace. Weekends will  usually find yourself at work.
good,"I did like the environment and the people that worked at Sonoco. However, I was a temporary employee so I didn't receive the benefits of the actual company. It was long hours though standing in one spot as far as packing goes, I disliked that about it. They do have crew meetings once a month though to keep you posted on everything and they do pay us for those if we attend which was a plus"
good,The job was ok but a bit stressful cuz I worked graveyard and always was tired when I worked there but it was a good place too work at just too much for me
good,"sonoco has great benefits but low pay for the amount of work expected, Its very fast paced environment. Lunches and breaks are paid. Very hot, very dirty environment. If you dont like heat then this isnt the job for you. Summer time is the worst. Overtime is mandatory and in the summer you an bet on working 7 days a week and it will be even hotter i the summer.There is also a large amount of favortism show, bosses have family members who work there."
good,Brak zorganizowania. Nic nie jest na czas. Nic nie jest dobrze zaplanowane.
good,"Agilidade"
good,"Sonoco is a work place to get your experience started. However, in this plant it is hard to advance. Some of the managers are not willing to train or help in advancement."
good,I really liked the job not hard management wasn't fair to employees. Temp service hired people that couldn't do the job only to have them quit or get hurt favortisim plays a big role in this company the hardest part of this job was dealing with the people that didn't want to do their job
good,Not family oriented at all.  They expect you to basically live there working on average over 60 hours a week.  A lot of mandatory overtime that isn't brought to your attention until you are almost off for the day.  They cut corners on safety a lot especially with their incinerator.
good,"I didn't know my manager personally since I came through a temp agency, but the people there do not really care to get to know you. It is fast-paced and they expect you to be on top of your work which is good."
good,This plant dose the best it can to make the employee happy but not having a home life makes working here difficult . The benefits are OK and the pay is better than most.
good,"El ambiente en el trabajo es bueno, pero los del staff llevan pesima administracion, los sueldos son muy bajos para el trabajo que se realiza en algunas areas no todas, el gerente es un prepotente una vez me toco que me llamara la atencion y a pesar de que yo lo tome de buen modo, el de buenas a primeras se molesto hasta el punto de decir groserias."
good,mucha presion por parte de los jefes el trabajo no es pesado pero en tiempos muertos algunos supervisores se molestaban
good,"Algum tempo me sentia muito útil para a empresa, mas com o passar do tempo percebi que já não é a mesma utilidade de antes."
good,"I worked for Sonoco for a few years and the company itself is great to work for.   Good pay, benefits etc... but if the sales director for this division of Sonoco decides you should go regardless if it is warranted or not will just flat make things up.  Brought to upper management who wouldn't even talk about it.  Stay away from this division and you will love Sonoco."
good,"A typical work day here consisted of loading metal into a press, sleeving product and stacking finished product onto finished pallet.  Required quality checks of finished products were also performed at required hours. Work with the quality department to properly diagnose customer complaints and defects found at process. Properly putting the finished product and raw material into oracle throughout the shift was required.  Here I learned how to use Oracle, which is a much more effective way of keeping track of finished product and raw material in real time.  I caught on and learned Oracle so quickly that management made me an Oracle super user, where I would help out co-workers when they had problems with Oracle or when the supervisors were busy with other tasks.  Management here was horrible, the decisions that were made on a daily basis were horrible and made no sense in the long run.  It was poorly run and management treated employees very poorly. To me, they didn't seem to know much about successfully running a business."
good,"Se trabaja con gusto y con presión cuando no hay resultados, se aprende a todo ya que cumplimos con muchas actividades que no están en nuestro puesto, ayuda a tener experiencia en todas las áreas de todos los departamentos."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,muita informações desencontradas e pouca estabilidade.fiz bastantes amigos a parte mais dificio foi a falta de informações
good,"5pm - 4am"
good,"puchado,manuseio de máquina de embalar,mentalidade pequena,otimos,carga horaria,ambiente de trabalho."
good,Typical day consist of being punctual and picking packing product for shipment.
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, com bons benefícios ....."
good,"If you are a local hire this job may be"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Sonoco and if I really needed a job, I would not be against going back. The pay isn't too bad but there aren't many opportunities for advancement."
good,"Hard working teams. Input and collaboration is encouraged."
good,There is no plan to alleviate the the weekend work that happens 3 weekends a month on average. The plant should be converted to a 7 day 24 hour operation but instead employees over extended with hours.
good,"this job is better than a lot of places < its just sometimes they put the wrong people in good positions, when i started i thought we a lot of oppertunity but as time went on i found out different"
good,"When hired was told weekends are voluntary for OT.  This is not the case, you get no weekends off.  You either get Sat. off or Sun. off depending what you get scheduled you can volunteer for the other day.  Schedule goes up late every week so you can never plan anything.   Press operators get paid the same as secondary.  Secondary works at their own pace. Press operators work as fast as the machine puts out the parts on multiple presses."
good,"Sonoco was truly a blessing for me & my family. Unfortunately,  i was in a position of authority and responsibility, which translated into, Demand... i was mentally and physically drained from the hours & responsibility in my work area. I was compensated very well, monetarily. Money wasn't the issue, the lack of time & involve  with any personal life/family, was the breaking point!"
good,"I originally signed on to be a full time employee, or at least that what was told to me. Turned out to be a contract job and an unexpected contract expiration date. Great Supervisor, great people to work with, however; the leadership there was a but underhanded. Treated a little differently because I was a contractor. And I was not looking forward to more contract work but was kind of forced into it or the alternative was to leave."
good,"Management has unrealistic expectations from production employees.Alot of frivilous charts that have to be initialed daily, if an employee forgets to initial one of the numerous charts for the day,that employee would be repromanded the following day.It all depends on how well management likes you as far as disiplining goes."
good,"I enjoyed the work here, but the supervisors could definitely use some training.  The company isn't consistent across the board, but the union has your back."
good,"Great people, great atmosphere and room to grow and advance if you are willing to relocate out of state to another plant.  The culture is great but relocation is required to get ahead."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"Boa empresa, más pouca oportunidade de crescimento, não há plano de carreira para os colaboradores."
good,"Busy."
good,"The job was okay, of course like anyone, we had our good days and bad days. A lot of under  the table relationships that tend to have and affect on the way people are treated and chosen to be promoted. "
good,The people are easy to work with and provide decent work life balance. The management team I was involved with were easy to work with
good,"Employees on production floor are Union. Very difficult to work with Union employees.  "
good,"Good company to work for at first but went down hill."
good,"While working for Sonoco, production was busy and there was always room for advancement. Management was a little unbalanced but people were able to get a fair chance. I was able to learn the importance of having strong communication skills and working together as a team. The hardest part of the job at first, was dealing with unprofessional leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job was the activities that we would do to promote things such as, safety, or PPE."
good,i would rather explain in person.  the job was enjoyable.  management did not perform as professional as they should have.
good,"An excellant starter company to learn and work in a custom molding enviroment. Products include, filtration, bio med, and food service sector."
good,Operation of forklift loading and unloading trucks an operating recycling machine recycling plastic and trash from all the Walmarts in the state of Florida
good,The food grade rules for production are not for everyone and the expectation of near perfection with 30 year old equipment is unreasonable and stressful
good,Slow paced and no room to move. Set up camera's for our safety I am not sure anyone believed that. Starting wage same as everyone else no matter what experience you have.
good,i have worked there for a long time and i like the job but that is what it is a job and the corporate people make the job more difficult and no one get held accountable for their actions till it is to late
good,"Working conditions were hot and it was hard labor. The job postion deities increased twice with no pay increase. They had pore benefits, had to work there for three year to get two weeks vacation."
good,"Sonoco site was DeKalb,IL. I made the least amount of money at this site and it was the most strenuous on the body but you got a workout that's for sure. As a female it was a bit difficult to become an operator and the guys can get a bit perverted but you learn to ignore it, it's easy to get injured at this job working on the machines so be very careful."
good,"If you’re looking for money or trying to save for a big purchase this is the place for you, you’ll work 40-60 hours a week depending on business. With the worse weeks being 84 hours (7, 12 hour shifts) with Sunday’s paying double time. Easily a place where you can make a lot of money rather quickly. However management sucks there is tons of favoritism and if you’re in it for the long haul you’ll have to kiss up to get anywhere in the company. Raises are done annually and promotions is supposed to be by seniority, however they’re done by who management likes the most and wants in that position. And they will never give u a clear cut answer as to why you get beat out in a position. All breaks are paid for however you aren’t allowed to leave company property. And you aren’t allowed to smoke on the property even on break. All in all what area you work in and what coworkers  you have working with you can make the long hours and weeks a breeze or a living nightmare. Would only recommend to someone who is in need of making some serious money and then wants to move on."
good,"The company corporate culture is not the most in touch with its plant level facilities. There is not much room for advancement, and mentoring is low.."
good,They are a company in transition.   The management focus is all over the place and having a lack of focus on one specific thing at a time is spreading people thin.
good,"J’étais sur la maintenance des machines. "
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"fun place to work. Production based job where you were rewarded for  meeting goals/ The hardest part of the job was working long hours and the most enjoyable part of the job was having understanding management, thoroughly trained and compensated based on production efforts."
good,Great place to work but a lot of the thinks management say and wants to be done as far as safety its dont apply to the floor. They wants product out the door but when it comes to safety its whatever gos..they don't want you to rush because it's a potential that someone will get hurt but it seems that it dont matter when it comes to working on the floor...
good,"If you don't like hard work this isn't the place for you. You will work swing 12 hour shifts every week. The pay is worth it. Excellent benefits. Misogynistic, not female friendly and little dramatic. The management isn't always there for you."
good,"Teamwork definitely needs improvement.    It is a job that takes years to learn because it is a precise job and you have to constantly maintain your machine, from start to finish on every job and I enjoyed it."
good,"For the most part is ok, but if something doesn't align with their direction they won't hesitate to throw you under the bus. I was put on a shift that they knew I didn't like after telling me that I was a valued employee."
good,"Always promised to get a day off and it didn't happen. supervisor on 2nd shift was great though, probably the only reason a lot of people stayed. High turnover due to group leaders"
good,The job was ok. How ever is one of the machines broke they took their time at getting it fixed. We would have to try and use the machines while they were broke..
good,"I enjoyed working there, met some nice people to talk to which made the day go quicker. but once i didn't get paid for my week and they didn't resolve the problem I quit. I didn't want to because i needed the job."
good,I like some of the people I was working with but I seen a lot of things that wasn't professional. I learned  a lot at sonoco but it's more for me to learn somewhere else.
good,"LIKED THE WORK BUT COULDN'T GET TO WORK WITHOUT A CAR OR CARPOOL. Nice warehouse, nice people, frequent breaks. Didn't overwork you. Had good work to do to keep me busy."
good,long time  need some help in some areas raised my two kids andsent them to school seen great day and bad day like any where else i have been in electrical for 30 yrs
good,"pues travajar aki es muy cansado por q tiene turnos de 12 hrs y los descansos son entre semana es muy presionado,pero lo que tiene es que te dan mucho tiempo extra cuando son tus descansos aki aprendi mucho a usar mucha herramienta y a sacar medidas esactas los domingos te dan lonche ynpues tus dos idas al comedor la de el lonc y la de el breik yo la catalogo como una enpresa ke se fija mucho en la seguridad tedan muchas capasitasiones semanal menta pero loke nome gusta eske no tienen categorias ni aumentos de sueldo"
good,"Load product, create bill of lading for outgoing product, move material to production."
good,Working 12 hours on nightshift with a new baby just wasn't working out like I had hoped.
good,you have to be good with people and be able to pick up heavy items and work long hrs.
good,"The number one thing to remember at Sonoco is safety. They will walk you to the door without thinking if they think you are putting your teammates in danger, which is a big plus. I learnt so much at this job. To bad they lost one of their contracts and I got laid off."
good,"shifting skedule morning and graveyard, time management is what i apply here. No problem with my co-workers we have open communication no problem in nationality. The most enjoyable part we have good salary but we dont have SSS number and every salary its deducted in our payslip. The enjoyable in our job we have one week off no salary but we can go malling andshopping."
good,Not bad if you don't mind doing the same stuff every night. Every line is different but the concept is all the same. Gets very boring very quickly but the pay isn't bad and they seem to treat you ok. Safety freaks though for sure.
good,If your looking to work 24-7 but make good money this is the job for you. 6 days a week 12 hours a day. They pay very well but it’s no life for people with family’s.
good,"I love my job, and the company I work for,but the people are very disrecptful to other employees, the lead and management show favortism, some employees are not courteous to others when doing their breaks, but nothing is said about it, because of the favortism to certain employees. And the employees talk behind each others back."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"Overall, good company to work for. I was part of a company buy-out so never really got to experience Sonoco's environment but from the many people I was able to talk with from the company I had a good perception of their work values."
good,"A typical work day consisted of you paying close attention to certain labels on plastics, cannot get behind very often. Workplace is very diverse many people do speak different languages so it can get difficult to communicate."
good,Entreprise valorisant la sécurité des employés et la productivité
good,"Good company just don't get hours needed. I love the company as a whole been with them for several amount of years, Benefits are great. Just work load is slow"
good,The company was a good company to work for definitely had cool people there and was really relaxed I would recommend to anyone of my friends to work there
good,"Enjoyed the work and facility was decent, not enough advancement being taken place. Staff and employees very nice and good people. better structure and guidance needs to be set in place."
good,"Sonoco is simply another company.  It is a great place to work if you know the right people and get in a good department.  Just like with any company, Sonoco has it's ups and downs.  It is a job..."
good,"Sonoco is a very safety oriented company, that provides a caring and fulfilling workplace environment. A typical work day here consisted of maintaining the procedures of being able to function. As working with industrial product and stacking finished product on finished pallet. Required quality checks of finished products were also performed at required hours. Work with the quality department to properly recognize customer defects and complaints found at process. Properly recording the finished goods and raw material into oracle throughout the shift that is required. I learned how to use Oracle, more effectively in ways of keeping track of finished products and raw material in a timely manner. Where at time I would find myself helping others co-workers when they had problems with Oracle or when the supervisors were busy with other tasks. Management here was horrible, it was poorly run and management treated employees very poorly. I don't think they knows much about running a  business."
good,Working there was hot in the summer and cold in the winter but that’s Indiana. The management wasn’t bad. They have some issues like all companies but wasn’t a bad place to work.
good,"Excellent ambiance mais niveau direction je pense qu'il y a vraiment des efforts quand on est en intérim se faire parler comme des chiens, menace de faire des mails à la boîte intérim..."
good,"A fine place to work, very hard work though.  Employees are friendly and management was not too difficult to get along with.  Would recommend for young people looking to get some experience."
good,I dislike it but I'm grateful. The hardest part about the job is working around the Polyurethane foam. The culture is diverse. Some people don't have to worry about being placed in certain departments of the warehouse so be advised that they don't always rotate even though they should. Some departments are easier than others.
good,Overall fun place to work but not a lot of opportunity for growth in the finance department. Great effort in trying to make safety first. management very focused on making money not employees.
good,"Did not have a good experience with my coworkers."
good,"Sonoco is a very safety oriented company.  That is great except when a company takes it too far.  As a technician I went from a troubleshooter to parts changer and machine downtime tripled.  The biggest plus where I worked was the family environment, but corporate management seemed to be very cut throat."
good,Ten to twelve hour days and six days a week for little pay and decent benefits.  Never knew how long you were working until the Supervisor came and told you.
good,Só precisava ter mais oportunidades de crescimento.
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits. They work too many hours though for people who have families. 12 hr days. sometimes mandated to work Saturdays and sundays also.
good,"Lack of growth opportunity only temp assignment, cater to Hispanics only get sent home when work is slow, fast past environment, no benefits, 30 min lunch, no overtime."
good,It's a nice place to work if you can deal with the drama. Some of the supervisor's show a lot of favoritism to some of the workers an they don't have to do anything.
good,"The hours were extremely long, 12 hour minimum, and mandatory OT was extremely common. The management was slow to address safety issues and bullying that went on by fellow employees."
good,"The workplace overall is great benefits are great it's a place with a lot of opportunities and  rewards, free  lunches for are safety achievements  it's great"
good,"Family type company but my division, tube and cores was part of a declining market. As a result, division was getting smaller and not a good area for a recent college graduate to start out in."
good,Tough place to work .You will work for your money. They tend to make  choices that do not always make sense.Closing plants that are making money. But not ones that are losing money.
good,"Good work life balance, flexible schedule, but opportunities for advancement are declining due to serving mature markets. "
good,"It's clear that this company was built on good ethics and doing the right thing. But as with all manufacturing jobs, work-life balance is a struggle. Many times supervisors have to work 12+ hours every day and also work weekends."
good,"Great place to work. When its slow its very slow, and when its busy its seven days a week for three to four months. Management is great very easy going and great to work for."
good,long busy days with little management support on issues. Big company and not  a lot of personal interaction with hourly level employees. good pay due to overtime.
good,It was a fun fast paced environment. The management was very helpful and gave amazing training on the presses that I was running. Safety was a big pillar in the work place which was very reassuring that the number one goal every day was to be sure that we all went home saffly
good,"Nach zwei Wochen einarbeit wird mein ""Betreuer"" in Urlaub geschickt und die Arbeit lastet auf dem Neuen allein."
good,"Sonoco is an international company with established Safety and Quality programs.  I entered the company as a Quality Coordinator but quickly had HR admin, Payroll and Safety added to my duties.  I love my job, my office and my coworkers but changes in management occur all too often which makes for a very unstable environment.  Changes are good but changing too frequently leads to confusion and frustration.  "
good,tres exigent- travaille a pression mais payant la securite tres respecter
good,I've learned how to planned difference job for difference machine. Learned how long one work order with their speed to completed. Learned how to change the paper if the existing paper finished. Learned how to do inventory check.
good,Machine operator experience would be useful. Communication is good between employees and boses.8 hour shift with 2 paid 7 minute breaks and 1 18 minute lunch.
good,"Its was either really cold or really hot. We got a measly two twenty minute breaks on a ten hour day. Besides that the work was straight forward, got a few extra skills on paper work in a shipping distributor deportment. A lot of friendly faces there, not much honesty. Hardest part of the job would have to be having the floor to yourself or back tracking a label on a pallet. Eating lunch was fun."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,Great experience but a very difficult time to start a farming operation in the Southeast. Interest rates were at 18% + and severe weather issues. Great way to start a foundation for present customer base.
good,"Friendly colleagues, willing to help when needed. Comfortable and safe work environment. Fun and challenging projects to work on."
good,good pay cant argue.  just a job for me to get by until i finish school.  but overall pretty good place to work many people actually retire with this company
good,"given 40 hours a week. "
good,"The day usually starts soon as the buzzer goes off. Check production sheets to find out whats on the agenda for the day. Materials were usually in position for ""one"" to start. Make sure welders were to acceptable conditions as well. Once all materials accounted for, welding starts and materials are usually pre-cut but re-checking them for reassurance is a must! Most jobs are done in teams, but seldomly you work alone."
good,"Overall, it was good place to work"
good,"Start equipment to start production process"
good,Sonoco's culture is overly focused on safety which can be a positive and negative.
good,"Management out of touch with work force."
good,This place is now closed. The plant is shut down.  A review is pointless as the workplace no longer exists.  May want to add an option to indicate when a workplace has closed its doors rather than having the user type more in the review to continue.
good,"A atuação dentro de uma empresa americana é diferenciada, com algumas possibilidades de colocar em prática algo que vivenciei durante a formação profissional."
good,"Growth mode"
good,"Learned a lot about packaging machinery, maintenance in general, and coordination and documentation of all related activities."
good,"Great warehouse job. Show you how to use a forklift and if you do well there is room for advancement it just may take a while. They practice safe work environment techniques everyday. Short breaks, but it's a well worth it job."
good,I liked it a lot while I was there.  the people are very nice and I made a lot of friends while I was there
good,"Receive assigned work areas, How to work in a timed rotation while maintaining quality and quantity. First shift co-worker easy to get along willing always willing to help. Rotation being able to work different jobs, stops from being bored. Difficult co-workers"
good,"Good Place, good company, good benefits. The hardest part of the job is getting use to the temperature."
good,Bad Place to work. Poorly managed and HR will be dishonest to employees to manipulate a situation to the employers benefit.
good,Tuve que sufrir la envidia del encargado del otro turno que hizo las cosas difíciles para que mi turno pudiera desarrollar la actividad con normalidad. No se daba cuenta que a quien perjudicaba era a la empresa no a mí a que yo cambien de empresa buscando mejores opciones.
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"During a typical day I would operate, troublechoot, and maintain metal stamping press. I would also package finished goods, fill out paperwork, and do guality checks. I became more familiar with machinery, controls, and safety around machinery. I gained more experience working as part of a team. My coworkers are good people and good at working as a team."
good,they moved to chesterfield half of workers were redundant It was nice job with lots of days off .I learned how to repair and fix many machines what i found practical in future life also different type of managering than in others companies typical american managering system People were nice and work there for very long time what made them cooperate in their own ring family trees and collegues all keep together so is hard for new workers that was the only problem
good,"I have great bosses who value family time and being flexible in order to be a part of family. I value and appreciate that. There are set items that are handled daily or on otherwise scheduled that I enjoy the continuity of, however, I enjoy the HR and project surprises that come along as well. My boss calls me his 'star' employee and while I feel appreciated by him it is very difficult to feel that I am not shown appreciation by the company."
good,"12 hour shifts, dangerous conditions, too much personal drama from co-workers that was not managed well by upper management."
good,I enjoyed working here for a while until they started sending people home because there was no work.
good,Good group on site but off site management did't care about facility and treated facility like a red headed step child
good,"The benefits are fair. They don't value their employees. They are definitely willing to train people to move up although sometimes they do hire from outside the company. I enjoy my coworkers, they're good people. They don't give pay raises based on evaluations, but in comparison to what others in the same position make. This means that people with no drive or a poor work ethic make as much money as those who are ambitious and take pride in their work."
good,Have to be able to work in a very hot and very cold weather and able to pack and  Inspects parts very quickly And work well with others very willing to help your neighbor
good,"I liked most of the people I worked with and most of the management was awesome it's just the pay isn't very good, at least when I was there it wasn't good."
good,Fun people to work with.      Short breaks no smoking policy.                Decent benefits.       Work weekends.          Good training.  Protocols.  Good support team
good,It's fast paced. They have daily safety meetings between shifts and when you first get in. You get to rotate between 5-6 different machines to get an all-around experience.
good,I was hired in at Sonoco as a shipping/ receiving coordinator.  Sonoco was a good place to work.  Sonoco provided security of a steady income and the people were great I worked with.
good,"Kinda boring, just stood there waiting for parts to drop, repack was the best cause you stayed busy. Two fifteen minute breaks and thirty minute lunch."
good,When I first interviewed here was told rarely or never work Saturdays we did last week. Also told rarely work OT also found out not the case. You can work as much as you want whether its required or not. Not exactly told the truth there.
good,"A maioria dos dias de trabalho na empresa é bem movimentado, porem ocorrem novidades e ocilações, um dia muita atividade em outro pouca. Procurei absover o máximo de informação e aprendi bastante sobre alimentação de produção, mesmo minha área de atuação sendo logística."
good,The job kept you busy the whole shift. Enjoyed the work pace and Great employees. Very good benefits and pay. Con would be the heat during summer.  Felt valued as an employee
good,working for them for 24 years of service was like making a second family. i loved my job and will miss working for Sonoco Display and Packaging LLC.  Thank you.
good,"Typical day of work was working on an assembly line doing a number of tasks, working with temps who really didn't want to work."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"No job was difficult to do, but could be very frustrating to complete. On time arrival and staying the entire 12 hour shift is required. This job requires you to stand the entire shift. You have to stack boxes 4-5 rows high. You need to be very aware of your surroundings, for everything was tightly squeezed on the production floor."
good,"Sonoco is a productive orginazation and has great benefits, but i am looking for more hours. Everyone is friendly and easy to get along with. The toughest part of the job is trying to lift heavy stuff more than 100 lbs."
good,Its been a good place to work for a lot of years hate to see it go. also  a place that cares a great deal for safety and helping others.
good,"Had a great 3 years there. Felt like family. Long 12 hour days but i knew when i had days off, overtime was offered. Made bath and body works bottles.  "
good,"Basically it was training for working as part of a team. Assigned a line and asked to run it over a 10 hour shift. Company employees were an excellent group of people, we worked with temps from Accu-Temp staffing. Did everything from build store displays to working with contact lenses and compact discs."
good,"Management in tiffin OH plant is quite bad.  They don't stick to policies, and if they don't have a policy they only do what benefits them.  There are a lot of ongoing issues with employees talking about quitting and hating their jobs, simply because management doesn't make employees feel appreciated.  No one has a set job description, it's do what we say because we pay you.  People get energy isolation violations and they hinder you from moving up to a different job, however there was a recent incident where 7 guys were working on a machine that wasn't properly locked out and because of how many employees involved it got swept under the rug. Not a single employee got more than a write up.  It wasn't even in our plant communication meeting.  Another major issue is when we are short people we have to ""double up"".  This is where we each have a 30 minute time slot where we either have to watch a second machine or fill in for a missing packer.  We do not receive any extra pay for this extra job task which happens sometimes every day of the week.  Sonoco is all about safety however if we start a machine up while doubling up we are the operator and the packer so we have to throw our own sheets off and rush down to the packing table to keep up, which is very unsafe.(this is just one example)  When i have brought this to the attention of management they just shrug it off because our ""doubling up"" saves them money.  It seems as if all they care about is running machines faster and making more money.  Honestly the only reason i still work here (which is the same for many other employees)"
good,"Managers pick favorites to listen to and ignore the rest. So people can lie about you, and there is no way to defend yourself. HR is useless."
good,Yo estuve en la termo era empacadora de la termo uno y solicite fajas porque estibaba muchas tarimas y nunca me la dieron aparte que había un supervisor llamado Alonso que solo a las jovencitas las tenía de líderes aunque no trabajaran y alas demás señoras las tenía en las termos ganando menos y con mucho más trabajo ojalá y el dueño se enteren para que más gente no pasen por lo mismo y ponga a liderar a gente que si trabajen y traten bien a los demás
good,"It's not a bad job to have, very laid back culture. The work isn't hard but it is very repetitive. Supervisors are very easy going, but they don't seem to care about the workload they put on the workers. There is a large disconnect between everyone on the floor and upper management, they don't listen to any comments/complaints. They have no system to track inventory, at least once a month we ran out of material, color, or boxes. There is not much opportunity for advancement, anyone higher than a packer will be there for years to come. "
good,Part time is okay as long as you have another source of employment.  These people fire 100 people at a time without warning. One day your badge will work the next day you can't get in the doors. Replaced by robots.
good,"HR was abysmal and management was poor."
good,Not a place to work to many years at due to the burning plastics and all the heat from the machines.  Very boring and little training on machines since all the wiring diagrams and schematics are out of date or don't exist.  Machines are very old and are in need of rebuilds but production will not let you have them to work on until its to late.
good,A typical day at work was working hard to get the orders out to the customers. At this job I learned about different car parts. Management was pretty laid back and easy to deal with. It was either very hot or cold depending on the weather. The hardest part of the job was placing the parts inside the curing room in the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting  and working with a few awesome people.
good,Great company to work for and advance your career. The training and orientation of new employees are great and interactive. I would recommend this company to a friend or relative.
good,"Overall I think Sonoco Plastics is a fantastic company to work for, the values of treating the employee's equally and fairly are very important.  Safety are our number one objective and a lot of focus on safety.  In general I think the current plant I work in has a lot of change to accept, ownership in employee's views and a solid plan to boost moral."
good,Didn't work here very long but good work experience.. putting ink in designated areas on assembly line...
good,high speed paper can assembly. safe environment. work alone a lot. satisfaction of sending a quality product to customer.
good,You start at the bottom and work your way up. The tradition and values of this company is really cool.
good,"Uma empresa Dinâmica, confiável, que une os seus funcionários em busca do mesmo objetivo. Trabalhar juntos."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"There is no aspect of what I do that is hard. I really like the job and love the people I work with. In the past few months, we have been through some upper management changes that has left a lot to be unappealing. The pay and benefits are very nice."
good,"Pay is great. some of the people are wonderful to work with and will become your best friends. Some people will go out of their way to make you miserable, and management will turn a blind eye."
good,The people are awesome and the work is fair the weekly pay is good and weekends off Is a plus also the way they make sure the plastic is quality before packaging it for the buyers
good,My job was productive and fast paced at sonoco. The employees were helpful on training me. Sonoco is a very safe and accident free workplace and pays decent money hourly.
good,"a typical day at work, I would come in to my office check the schedual then make cards out and make out our run sheets, then get on the forklift and bring up the lumber that we were going to need to start. after that I supervised my men and did safety audits, quality audits, and hot spot audits, but I never sacrificed safety for quanity, my employees well being were my top priority, in fact they would actually come into my office and tell me things like ""my wife just left"" and things like that so I had the respect of my men and I showed them respect as well."
good,How to handle packs. How to operate a pallet jack. hard part was staying awake when I work from 10pm to 7am
good,"i learned how to operate a forklift drill press ,and my manager was a great lady...."
good,era uma empresa pequena onde todos nos tinhamos chance de falar era otimo trabalhar com eles e o ambiente e as pessoas era muito bons
good,"Sonoco it's a  good company but there are something that personally don't like because if some one had learned important position like operating a production machine, never gives a raise"
good,"This company was very safety oriented.  Was an ok place to work.          They are no longer open in Boone, IA.    not sure what else to put down here."
good,"went into sonoco,put in my pin number , we all had a short and brief meeting then we got right too work,I learned that working with others to accomplish goals is very important and to help your fellow co workers.The management was very strict.They accepted all races and cultures,The hardest part of the job was the speed you only had so much time before another part would drop.I enjoyed having a little celebration when the company would sell the amount of parts they needed too."
good,Most everyone at sonoco was friendly and easy to get along with. I had no trouble learning how to do the job. I worked overnights so it was a little hard to adjust to staying up. Overall it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"piden todo tu apoyo  "
good,"I worked in the warehouse loading & unloading vans. I worked in the press shop where i sorted the press operatives with there materials & clear there pallets away once completed. When i worked the night shift i was the only FLT driver in having to sort the 2 or 3 machines with the materials i.e board, layerpads, pallets & labels. I had to clear the machines when the pallets had been wrapped. Inbetween all that i had to load 4 trailers on my own. Working the 12 hour night shifts was my most enjoyable times I enjoyed the pressure of loading 4 trailers & sorting the materials out for the machines."
good,"no training, lack of communication, long hours, heavy work loads, not enough money. Very into safety, but when it comes down to it. nobody cares. Management doesn't communicate with one another, so none of them know anything that is going on."
good,De segunda a Sábado. Aprendi a ter mais flexibilidade. A direção muito rígida.
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,At present am cooking for 30-35 people. The platform is nice as are the hands onboard. I work from 3am till 6pm with a 2 hour break.
good,"I learned that I would never be able to advance very far in my position and that a first shift job will be forever out of reach. Overtime is mandatory, so if you want any kind of life don't apply. If you enjoy working your life away in the same position on the same shift for the same wages then this is the job for you."
good,Would not go back. Management are secure in their positions and will do all they can to maintain that security. Advancement is hard due to professional politics.
good,"Face paced job that requires attention to detail.  Each day is different.  Nothing is really complicated about the job, just complicating situations at times.  Thing I enjoy most is working with my customers."
good,"Worked in a dusty, noisy non-family environment."
good,Poucos cargos para propiciar crescimento profissional.
good,tengo trabajando 6 años para la empresa y lo que he visto es que casi no se promueve al personal
good,"Good Company.  Helpped me adavnced my career.  I worked my way from Operator, to shift lead, to Training Supervisor.  Then through Sonoco I was able to adbmvance my career with Siegwerk, where I work now."
good,Overworked for some while others get away with not doing their jobs. Too much personal life in the workplace. Not everyone abys by the same rules. Underpaid as well.
good,"Um empresa boa para se trabalhar. rotinas bem definidas e metas a serem alcançadas. empresa bem solida no mercado, que trás mais segurança e estabilidade aos funcionários."
good,This was my 1st manufacturoing job as a packer I learned some machines.  Only thing met one lady who had been a temp 18 years same pay as me.  Some people never came to work for weeks and pop back up its ok.  They were nice to us and met some great people.  Learned so much was able to get better job.  Pay is around minimum wage even on 3rd shift.  But it's a job when u have no where to go and there very nice
good,"I liked working there, and if it was closer and I thought I could get promoted I would be still there. It don't pay as much as some industrial jobs do, but the people there makes you feel like a part of the group."
good,Overall this was a great company to work for. The upper management were good and growth opportunities available. The plant I worked for had a great assistant plant manager but Plant Manager was a micro manager who prevented anyone who could do their job from advancing because he felt his plant standards would drop.
good,Weekly pay is what i like easy to catch on to the various products and how to pack them. 3rd shift flies by and its only Sunday through Monday. No direct deposit you just pick up your check pn Fridays
good,É um lugar bom de trabalhar mais falta reconhecimento de pessoas e falta competência na gestão.
good,the work is not steady and there are times where they will only let you work 1 day a week.  there are no benifits and no way to move up
good,"O dia dia é de uma empresa normal onde cumpro os meus deveres de forma profissional, há dias estressantes mas controlados, há problemas mas são resolvidos. Aprendir que sou capaz e tenho condição de crescer junto a empresa. A direção estar a cada dia procurando a melhorar, posso dizer que é uma boa direção. Os companheiros de trabalho são maliável. A parte mais díficil são os obstáculos que as vezes aparecem, mas isto é normal. E a parte mais agradável, é saber que você fez um bom trabalho, sendo reconhecido por tal feito."
good,era buena empresa lo que pasa que te contrataban por agencia y la agencia solo te daba contratos de 2 meses al final si habia pedido te renovaba el contrato si no te descansaba un mes no habia estabilidad laboral
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,would start my day of doing pm checks on the forklifts. From there I would service the machines that were not being used . all female employees in the plant except my self and the floor supervisor  different but good people.
good,The work at this factory was very repetitive. Every day the same machines were assigned to specific people to run them. Packaging and stocking were the main goals in this facility. Moderate energy level in this environment.
good,Sonoco was an awesome Flexographic Printing company but with a high turn around due to the stress level there. 2-10 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch made life there a little tough but doable.
good,"This is the best description for Sonoco as a whole. 300+ plants and you can move within. Excellent benefits, excellent culture, great operations management group."
good,"This was a great place to work.  The people are good, and the job was good. The only reason I left was because there was no room to move up. I would go back in a heart beat."
good,"Most days was pretty easy. Just wash dishes, peel potatoes, and prepare a couple of salads. apples water plates nothing"
good,i really enjoy working there. the work was very easy to do. you wasnt over work but was sure to have lots of work. it was a nice work place and the workers were nice and quick to help if help was needed.the hard part of the job is when the scrap ben would get full and it had to move by hand it was very heavy to do. the good part avout the job was that your lunch would be paid for and the shift time.
good,"Typical day I loaded items onto conveyor belt "
good,Co-workers were great and I made a lot of friends over the years. I had no work to life balance as I was required to work too much overtime. Typically worked 7 days a week and 60 hours plus a week. It was not uncommon to work 84 hours a week.
good,Great job... friendly and fast paced environment. The hours were good how ever its closing down without notice and I really liked the job.
good,"Liked working witht the team that I had to work with. Management was good, benefits could've been better, but overall it was smooth and productive. I liked it."
good,"Good work environment, easy commute from home, excellent pension scheme."
good,Certainly not a manufacturing facility but a good place to learn about production tracking. Not much standardization or organization to the process but overall a friendly environment.
good,Sonoco products is good place to work. Sonoco products is based in a small town in South Carolina.  Sonoco products is a packaging company.
good,"employees at Sonoco are very hardworking dedicated and most of all professionals in their fields of work. The employers and trainers at Sonoco, take time, pride and great effort in teaching their trainees of all that is required of them to do in their field of work. I work at Sonoco for just a week through a Temp Agency and during my time with them, they welcomed me as one of their own and worked with me throughout my time there, a company I will gladly return to work for as a full time employee if such an opportunity is granted to me."
good,Great Work Environment. Fast Paced. Enjoyed. Learned new concepts.
good,"This was a good job, great people, pay was alright for the time and I like the work."
good,"Good work environment,co-workers were great to work with. Safety was very well used in the plant."
good,"learn to work as a team"
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"I work a 12 hour shift 5 days a week Monday through Friday.  I have gained more attainable information pertaining to not only others safety but my safety as well.  This is a very fast paced working environment therefore safety is a very important part of the job.  The management team is a down to earth team in that they realize that they too are just like us but have higher titles than others.  They realize that the overall important aspects of the job are team work and safety.  The hardest part of my job would be the hours.  As indicated previously, I work a 12 hour shift.  The 12 hour shift is not the issue.  It is just that my shift starts at 5:00 am.  However, I am now adjusting to the early hours."
good,"I learned a lot at Sonoco. Organizational skills and multi tasking.  I worked with every department within the company all over the US.  I also worked with outside vendors and overseas.  I worked with a lot of different customers like Gillette, P&G, Scotts Miracle Gro, and Kroger.  "
good,Working at Sonoco was like being in a strict routing the same thing everyday. I worked 6pm till 6am I would go in and start working right away. I inspected bottles and packed them into boxes.
good,Ótimo relacionamento entre as àreas contribuindo para melhor produtividades para todos.
good,"If you're not used to long days this job isn't for you. It is 12 hr days 2 on 2 off. Schedule is written a year in advance, you can have a good idea of when to plan personal events. They push safety and take pride in being a safe environment. Overtime whenever you like just show up and theyll let you have it. Good pay, and easy work, although sometimes boring."
good,A typical day would consist of constant moving of paper either taking it to the line or unloading trucks. The hardest part of the job was that the space was very limited so there was not much room to maneuver forklift equpiment. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with.
good,got training on forklift
good,"Spotted trailers in and out as needed, drove to metal center to pick up parts, gave breaks to the forklift operators, loaded and unloaded trailers, kept all lines stocked with product, made all bill of ladings, prepared manifest of all inbound and outbound material, answered customer calls, daily/monthly inventory, and ergonomics team leader."
good,The friendly and fun people were the best part of the job. There were many hard working people there. It did not feel like there was a lot of room to advance a career unless a lucky situation happened for a promotion.
good,I maintained all equipment and was every ware I was paged to fix everything. It is very fast paced and hardly any breaks. I am always on the go from when I punch in until I leave.
good,Good place to work for a manufacturing environment.  There is not a lot of room for advancement in manufacturing and to move-up there is a high likely-hood that you will have to re-locate
good,A typical day at work includes starting my crew with the daily safety topic and discuss any concerns the employees have. I've learned the value of hard work and to always drive to learn more. The hardest part of my job is dealing with sensitive issues with the up most professionalism between employees.
good,"es un buen lugar para trabajar, para una enfermera necesita base para poder valorar trabajar con ellos directamente."
good,Nice place to work! Sonoco is a great place to hone up on your skills  for advancement in your career. The management team has an open door policy. Which is available any time.
good,"Sonoco was a great place to work. Compensation was great, worked long hours but was paid well for my time. Management was easy to work with, everyone worked together well"
good,Yes sometimes it can get to be stressful especially for new employees. But people are as friendly as a factory worker can be. I enjoy my time here. With the exception of having to work weekends due to low staffing. The pay is nice and the benefits are fantastic.
good,"Was a great company untill new plant manager took over and brought people with him from other palnt. A lot of changessome for good others are bad."
good,"A typical day consist of stretching before work. Unboxing all the personnel, stacking it up onto the pallets. The workers are friendly and will help if you're lost with anything."
good,"Setup and run production machinery."
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"Was a great place to work. The pay was great, and the bonuses were great. Moreover, its nice to work for a company that goes out of their way to provide perks for their employees."
good,"I worked at Sonoco-Trident for three years with no raise, even though I was given more work tasks and continually took on more for them. When the company was moving I would have had to make an extraordinarily long commute and was not going to receive a raise. So I left."
good,"While Sonoco was a good place to work, I was not given the necessary training needed to succeed.  Each day I went to work without the confidence needed to make the job a success.  I was told I would be trained as I have a strong background in customer service and needed to learn business.  I did enjoy working with the various plants and the customers, but found my co-workers standoffish.  The environment is more suited for an introvert who does not need to interact as often with people.  I am an extrovert and found the workplace too quiet without much human interaction."
good,A typical day at work would consist of answering stress calls to production lines and solving any issues they might be having. Performing preventive maintenance on lines that were not in operation. working on safety projects or modifications to existing equipment. I gained strong troubleshooting and repair skills during my employment. My co-workers were very good people to work with. Management was over-all okay to work with. I think lack of communication was the main issue. The hardest part was troubleshooting equipment and resolving any issues found. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to solve and repair an issue on the manufacturing equipment.
good,Safety oriented company with productivity and quality at its core. Spending long hours a close knit working family made the days fly by. The daily tasks can get repetitive buts that's to be expected in a manufacturing career field.
good,"You will make excellent money, great job for a single person. This job can be rough on families, depending on the culture of the family."
good,great co-workers  days went fast very fast paced worked there 36yrs
good,"Rapidez é a palavra chefe pra esse serviço, trabalho em equipe caminha junto"
good,"A typical workday involves everything from collaboration with colleagues, managing external resources and addressing escalations from employees who have questions and/or concerns. "
good,en el poco tiempo que tengo en sonoco he aprendido a usar aparatos o herramientas que no habia usado y hay buena comunicacion con mis supervisores y mis compañeros de trabajo la parte mas dificil fue aprender a manejar el montacargas de hombre parado ya que donde trabajaba ultimamente usabamos montacargas de hombre sentado y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que hay un buen ambiente laboral.
good,"Was a good place to work. Moved up the chain quickly. Learned alot about management, inventory control, delivery of product and safety training. A great bunch of folks to work with."
good,"Many great people to work with at Sonoco. Sometime work could be slow and tedious, or doing the same thing over and over. You have the freedom to chit chat with fellow co-workers is a plus."
good,I would come in talk with manager what has gone on for the day hw would tell what he wants done for the day but the main priorty is keep the machines running
good,"Sonoco is a very ethical and cultural company. I particularly enjoyed the lengthy history and was always picking the brains of the long term employees. My co-workers were the best team. We all worked and played well together. I knew I could trust and depend on them when necessary. Most everyone within Sonoco is very professional and kind. My only con is the middle/upper management. I didn't feel that the best person for the position was always chosen. It felt like a ""Good 'ole boy"" mentality."
good,"Sent by temp agency. First couple of days were ten hour shifts in which you basically stand around and watch other workers, they don't let you pack until the third day."
good,Great place to work you won't be put under unreasonable amounts of stress great work life balance amongst all employees. Not sure about opportunities for advancement. There are quite a few temps and they remain temps for quite sometime.
good,At this company you will stand for almost 10 -11 full hours but they do pay you well and offer overtime that pays excellent if you are able to stand that long without problems.
good,Great people good environment  and an average pay but really no room for advancement .I really enjoyed working cause I was in control as a leader ....
good,Sonoco is a great company with a strong stable history. Best opportunity for promotion is a willingness to relocate. They have an excellent work life balance but always be prepared to go the extra mile for the customers and your supervisor/ manager.
good,"Abläufe waren unterschiedlich, da immer verschiedene Ware kommissioniert wurde. "
good,"Nice employees to work with. A welcoming environment, plenty of incentives and benefits. Buys food for employees on most weekend days. Management can be strict and uncaring at times."
good,"Overall a good place to work. I started as an inspector packer, when the quality of my work and education was noticed I moved up to quality quickly. I was encouraged to attend pillar team meetings and soon began my own pillar team. It is a good place to work when you are highly motivated and want to move up quickly."
good,"It is easy to quickly advance here, just keep good attendance. That's all that is required for most jobs here. Although, they are working on making it a better work environment with lean manufacturing techniques, and better training all the time."
good,Every day I look forward to going to work. I learned a new system  ORACLE. At the beginning it was a bit challenging but after a few days it was very easy to work with.
good,"Os dias sempre com as mesmas rotinas e atividades, mas com formas de realização diferentes, por isso sempre aprendendo e aprimorando a cada dia mais o conhecimento e experiência profissional.  O gestor sempre disposto e aberto para novos diálogos, e principalmente para ideias de melhorias nos setores. Os colegas de trabalho sempre dispostos a ajudar nas atividades, como nas suas funções e se necessário em outras, sempre para o bom funcionamento e produção da empresa. Algumas dificuldades mais frequentes era o clima, pois trabalhava no céu aberto, e ai tinha os dias de muito calor e os de chuva, mas nada que atrapalha se o desempenho das funções e muito menos a segurança dos trabalhadores. Algo muito agradável era poder chegar na empresa e poder realizar suas atividades com toda segurança e cuidado que a empresa sempre teve com seus funcionários. Fui muito feliz no tempo que trabalhei na empresa, pois aprendi muito, como ter união, comprometimento, humildade, e acima de tudo, gostar do que faz."
good,enjoyed working in the maintenance department enjoyed the shift work and the 12 hr shifts good safety and good manufactoring practices.
good,My mission is to  provide the customers the best service and hospitality on the job site with safety as the focus of every task me and my crew perform.
good,"I worked in the tube and core industry as part of Sonoco. I was hired as a temp and just worked for the summers. The people I worked with were great and the production manager was a great guy. It was just another factory job though. Boring work, long days. The pay was pretty good for still being in school. The retention rate of employees was pretty good. Most of the workers had been there over 10 years. Not a bad temporary position. Definitely don't want to get stuck in factory work for the rest of my life though."
good,"i was in thremoforming making plastic protectors for bic, robert boss, etc. I would set up and change over my machines. I would run 2 machines on a normal day but, some times i would run 3 machines if someone was out for the day. When i would have a change over. I would have to change out the dies that form the parts, the knife that cuts the parts out, and the stacker that pulls the parts out of the matieral. Then i would have to make the form to where it has no bridging, holes, or round corners. By fixing the temp, the die speeds, or the vaccum suction. Then i would have to set the knife by cutting a peice. Then take 2 parts from the oppesite corners. If they don't line up i'll have to move the knife which ever way i need to make them line up right and lock it down. Then set the stacker which I would just bring the bottom of the stacker up and line it up with the formed matieral lock it down. Run the matieral all the way out of the machine. Then i would bring the topand the bottom of the stacker together locking it down. Then i would start the machine up and get it running. then i would pull 2 or 4 parts out to meassure and make sure they are in the quilfied specs and sign off on them. Then tell the packer they are good to pack and just keep the matieral going to the machine and just wait til the job finished. While my machines was running and they was good. I would go help anyone elsa with there machines. the best part bout it was is most the time i stayed busy but sometimes I would get some long jobs and just have to keep matieral going. That meant a easy going night. The"

good,empresa competitiva  pero no tienes una compensación salarial de acuerdo al grado de responsabilidades y puesto ejercido
good,"Typically, walked to the workstation and talked to the operator from the previous shift. Perform quality checks right away and made any adjustments if needed. I was fortunate enough to get to know the mechanical and computer portion of the all of the machinery that I was responsible for. I was able to work with a great bunch of workers who cared about the products that we were making and also about the people that we worked with. The most frustrating part of the job was when the machines work break down and that we couldn't meet our quota. Although, the best part of the job was that, if everything was running top notch, we had time to perform the house keeping and also a little social time."

good,"I really liked working at Sonoco, I started as a temp on day shift & had to go to 3rds when I got hired in so I knew people on all three shifts, I got along with everyone & my supervisors were friendly & helpful. They offer good benefits, never had to do overtime or work weekends. I worked there for a year & never had any problems with anything."
good,"Fast paced and quite frustrating at times but served me well as being local "

good,Low requirement to get hired and easy advancement if you put in the work. Work was simple and lots of training available.  Good management but as a whole there were to many people training in different ways so it was impossible to get shifts on the same page to work together.
good,"During my employment, I had the opportunity to advance and was allowed to develop additional skills. Work/life balance was a challenge due to the type of position held"

But i enjoy everything about work and my employes that a work with."
good,The plants are fast paced and with the right management it is a great place to work. I used to enjoy my plant and management. Now its a totally different story.

good,Nice play to work at fun environment very helpful team.members and and managers are very helpful I would definitely recommend this job to people who like a face paced work environment

I loved the 12 hour swing shifts with a consecutive week off each month! I miss working at that job and for the company. I may end up going back one day. I'd recommend it.

good,A typical days work is attending my workplace to be informed of the days tasks from operator and setting saw unit to desired cut length and ID measurements of cores to be run.and getting packaging detailed of how cores are to packed and then shipped to customer.I learned much about working as a team and doing your specific role on floor.I found the management there was easygoing and flexible but not overly fair and impartial to each individual person.I would have liked more appreciation shown to the workers who work hard and do a good job.the workplace culture was easygoing and often lighthearted.but a few take that too far and tend to behave immaturely and careless towards their job.the hardest part for me was some heavy lifting but not that much.the most enjoyable aspect was working with people that respect you and treat you impartiallyand having a joke or laugh with the guys I was working with.
good,"Good place to work, as long as you are willing to work hard. The production is fast paced, and the work requires a challenging to develop skill set. If you are willing to learn while working hard, the people are friendly and the pay is good."

good,"Boas rotinas de produção , organização . Responsabilidade com meio ambiente  e uma boa gestão de RH"
good,"My job was hard but simple. I operated a shearing machine and a rolling machine. Always had sufficient help. Although mostly I operated machines. This is the company where I learned to weld, and decided to go to school and get certified. It was a kind of small facility therefore everyone knew everyone, a brotherhood of sorts. There was never a guess of what time we ended our day, leaving enough time in the evenings to handle personal business"

good,"Es una buena empresa, aprendí mucho con las personas que allí trabajan."
good,Everyone is very polite. I don't really like how hot it gets in there and how we have to use stationary fans (they're great but they only hit one spot). The management is also pretty polite and they really want production. They don't seem to realize that the faster we go the more likely the machine is to break or the parts are going to lose quality. They get mad when machines are down and to make up for time lost we go faster (thus leading to messed up machines or messed up parts).
good,Two shift job with 12 hour shifts. They give you uniforms for every day use. You have to atend 15 min preor your shift starts for shift exchange. Good vacation days

good,"It was a great job with great pay for the Jackson, Tn area. Hard job to get in to. 1 of the crew leads out of 4 has a nasty attitude and will definitely make you want to quit.

As long as you’re kissing the lead butt you’ll be untouchable (hence the fact I no longer work there)"

good,crecimiento y desarrollo a los trabajadores y ambiente laboral bueno
good,"I really enjoyed working at Sonoco. They are all about safety above everything else. Thats nice knowing they are so dedicated to striving for safety. Sometimes the managers don't communicate well. A lot of the message gets lost in translation. They have a very strict safety program that requires the employees to participate in, which is great because you start getting cross trained in all sorts of areas / functions. I learned a lot working there and would recommend working there absolutely."

Depending on seniority, you can decide what days you have to work 12 hours.  If you are at the bottom then your schedule is unpredictable.  There is little turnover at this plant so many of the people who have been there for 10 years or less may still find themselves with this problem.  The management has started a new phase of lean manufacturing which has resulted in some better things for the particular Sonoco plant.  The job is not physically demanding for the most part, but is very high paced.  There is a lot of walking and bending down.  The work area is very clean because of the product being food grade. The most trying part is that no matter how much you now or learn, that there is no chance for advancement or even chance to get to a regular shift.  I do enjoy the most of the people who work there along with the clean and great pay.environment"

good,"I learned how to interact with costumers better. A typical day consisted of stocking shelves, bagging, and carrying out groceries for customers.

good,"My job was a Mold-Setter and i absolutely loved it, My job was to put the molds in the presses so they can make the parts, and i was really good and fast at it and i really liked the fact that i loved coming in to work unlike some jobs I've  had where i absolutely dreaded going to work and made my life miserable in the process. But While working at Sonoco it was nice to have a Boss/Supervisor who actually cared and wanted you to do good but the main concern is Safety. Sonoco is really big on Safety and the health of the Employees. The Maintenance Supervisor witch was my boss he was just awesome and actually cared about us whenever we would work overtime witch was voluntary he always told us if he seen us getting burnt out and tired from working the extra hours he would take us off overtime, but i was one of those employees that always volunteered to work all the extra hours and all the Saturdays i could get because i loved cashing those checks. But All n All Sonoco is a really good place to work and the pay is decent and most of the people are nice and try to help you out when they can. The Only Problem I had was with there insurance well the prescription part anyway when i switched to Express Scripts if you take any Medication non-narcotic  you have to switch it to be home delivered by Express Scripts because you can only fill your Medication 3 times at a local Pharmacy after that the insurance wont pay for it and that's mainly why i lost my job there, Im type 1 diabetic and they wouldn't fill my insulin because i was never told by anyone that i had to switch to home delivery"
good,This plant has come a long way in the past year. Some of the people holding it back are now gone. The current management is doing an excellent job of engaging employees and listening to their concerns. I have finally found a place that I feel cares about me as a person. Most people are great to work with. I like feeling like I make a difference every day. I am trusted to do my job.
