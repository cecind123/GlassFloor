rating,review
bad,"Awful management, bad salaries, Excessive hours. Poor beneficies. In 24 years salary was $10 an hour. Supervisors aren’t professionals. I don’t recommend this company to anyone's."
bad,They put extreme pressure on the employees to sale products just to be in competition with other banks and if you don't make your sales they write you up on your performance sheet.
bad,"I hated that job so much, the hours were horrible, management was horrible. I hated and dreaded working there since day one. There was only one person I liked in that place."
bad,Poor leadership and no benefits for the associates  that work the overnight shift. At the same time this shift is overwhelmed with  work because the shift is composed by two associates . The management of Banco Popular is in need of retraining on how to work with different personnel.
bad,Es un empleo bastante estable pero no te permiten crecer dentro de la empresa  y no son prpo empleados. Si sobre pasas las metas o llegas a las mismas lo que hacen es subirtelas mas y mas paraque no puedas cumplir y no tenga que pagar incentivos. Almenos en el are de ventas y mercadeo
bad,"I was the head banker at a location in Panorama City, CA.. This location was a bound to be shut down sooner or later for the simple fact that management practiced opening accounts for people based on trust and friendship rather than their financial background history (which is what we are required to do). I was not comfortable with this unspoken rule that was encouraged by management just to meet and or exceed quoata. I stayed until I could find a more suitable job with morals and pride. I only say this because most of the accounts that were opened against company rules and regs. did fall into a delinquent status and made us all look bad."
bad,ambiente de trabajo cordial:recepcion de llamadas y la parte mas dificil era el poco espacio existente.
bad,This place is filled with people who do not know how to manage. A typical day at this job is answering calls (if working at the call center) without breaks. You have to let management know when you go to the bathroom and if you take too long they send someone to check up on you. If your absent 3 times you will get fired instantly no matter how many years you have been with this company. DONOT work here!!!! Find something else.
bad,banco popular worked well for me on the basis that it was only part-time.
bad,"This is the place to go to work if you want to be severely mistreated. You show up and basically get berated, told to do nothing our customers want, told to lie, and yelled at throughout your experience. Avoid working here at all costs."
bad,"Mi valoración no es buena, me parece una empresa anacrónica, mal gestionada."
bad,I learn a lot. But they are not very good employers. Very inconsiderate with the employees. They just care for the production.  The customer service it suppose to be first but its not.
bad,"he sido muuy buena empeada, honesta responsable, trabajar para esta empresa es dar lo mejor de si."
bad,"The actual work was not difficult; however, some of my former colleagues at the Bank were interesting individuals and presented a challenge to work with them."
bad,"I got this job through a temp agency that I can't remember the name of, but we were busy for like a month and then they ran out of things for us to do, so we sat around for the rest of the scheduled work period"
bad,"Muy desagradable en los últimos años, cambió mucho sus valores con Angel Ron"
bad,"Una vez estas dentro de la empresa, las cosas no son como  lo describieron. El dpto de Asesoría Laboral es pro empresa, te tratan con mucha arrogancia. Les molestas que dieras de lo que ellos piensan."
bad,Salario por debajo de los demas bancos. Poca oportunidad para crecer.   Pobres evaluaciones
bad,Think twice before accepting a job offer at this bank. Out of touch management. only pro would be the healthcare plan but is getting more limited each year.
bad,"I worked as an assistant manager which was a very fast past role which kept me on my toes. I've learned so much about managing and myself."
bad,"Experiencia buena, pero en salario y promoción regular para mucho trabajo que hay que hacer."
bad,I prefer not to review this employer. Numerous regions were closed resulting in a mass layoff.
bad,Typical day was fast paced helping clients who walked into the banking center. Approved transactions and provided coaching. Review reports for fraud and order cash and supplies.
bad,"No son buena paga pero teniamos buenos beneficio como plan medico, como todo fueron quitando los beneficios y el costo de vida sigue aumentando. Amaba mi trabajo, el poder ayudar a las personas para que no perdieran sus propiedades."
bad,I was originally hired by Quaker City bank and the bank was bought by Banco Popular. I didn't enjoy working for Banco do to poor management. They also change our hours which was a conflict.
bad,Long working hours with no clear advancement opportunities. Not to mention that most of the employees communicate in Chinese or Cantonese including the meetings which is really unfair and disrespectful to the employees who do not understand these languages. However this is Malaysia so I can't speak for other countries.
bad,"Es una buena empresa, el producto financiero es bueno, cuenta con personal capacitado y esta bien ubicado en distintas zonas del país."
bad,This bank promises but does not deliver.  Reward mediocracy. At the time of my employment technology was archaic for both internally and customer wise. I can not say that I learned anything because everything was so backwards.
bad,"desenvolvia uma comunicação positiva com o funcionário, porem nao contribuía para alimentação do  mesmo"
bad,the staff was committed to work and help the customer. Good attentive sucurcal with the client. Good atmosphere between colleagues. There was cooperation from all areas of the branch.
bad,As tarefas eram muito rotineiras e a pressão elevadíssima.
bad,typical day at popular bank is good and exciting accounts was ok entering through the system my cowokers were helpful most enjoyable was staying overtime
bad,"Decent vacation hours, friendly co-workers"
bad,The Sr Management Team is out of touch with the front line staff. Popular in the US is run like a poor stepchild to Banco Popular in PR.
bad,Ambiente de trabajo distendido donde destacaría el compañerismo y el apoyo mutuo.
bad,"●Managment chooses 10 calls at random, all have to be above 80% quality or they fire you. I believe that to be an unfair work practice, for no one learns the job perfectly in 3 months or even a year."
bad,Long and uninteresting days with very little people coming in. People moving over to Wells Fargo and management blaming tellers for this. It was boring.
bad,"Política de recursos humanos mal enfocada. "
bad,"Management is very unprofessional, the pay is garbage, so many rules and prohibitions for so little money, and the work load is heavy. One of my worst jobs ever."
bad,No me parece correcto hacer una valoración positiva o negativa en web
bad,The most difficult function of this job was getting support from management to move ahead with projects that would greatly benefit the bank.
bad,"El salario es aceptable."
bad,The people are great as far as environment however the pay is poor. Don't expect to get a raise because it's pathetic and you will have queue after queue added to your work load with no extra pay. The training will be continuous and expectations are rather high and unrealistic. The job is strenuous and stressful wouldn't recommend working there you don't have much room for growth and advancement.
bad,"Desde el software utilizado, hasta las campañas desmedidas por oficina y empleado, así como la política de recursos humanos es lamentable."
bad,"Typical Bank politics run amok here, between managers trying to keep you from advancing or pushing you out of their branches, upper management constantly pressuring you to meet sales goals and grow infinitely, there is plenty of reason to complain here. The pay is decent for the amount of work you actually perform which translates to long and boring days with little work. Calling nights are normal and if you're not on the phones calling people the entire time you're working you are considered lazy or not working. Work life balance is great but if you have stresses at home you shouldn't work here as this place will compound it. I wouldn't recommend working in any bank to anyone."
bad,"Lack of integrity, over work everyone there , send you to other branches without your consent, LOW PAY for all you do . No recognition. Don't waste your time."
bad,I liked working with the people and the customers. the only thing that was not so good was the pay. the management team where nice and very supportive in your ability to move up with in the company
bad,Severely  understaffed and inadequate management.Schedules are done week to week.The branch need trumps personal needs.
bad,My experience ion  Banco Popular of Puerto Rico was more like routine. Low pay rate and too much responsibilities .  It all ended when the bank got robbed and i felt my life was over .
good,"Management is not very friendly, you get written up easily and also they never appreciate your job efforts. Meeting goals was a challenge."
good,Banco con gran prestigio que en los últimos 12 años sus directivos no han sabido mantener el nivel de solvencia y rentabilidad que tenía
good,"Media/Baja."
good,"Job was not fun at all, to many people giving different directions and asking for the same information on different formats. Pressure levels were unsustainable and after all the bank was shut down by regulators (FDIC)."
good,Trabajo rutinario con reunión antes de comenzar el día con el encargado.
good,aprendí mucho pero el ambiente de trabajo era pesimo mucha competitividad.
good,"Los empleados son excelentes, pero la gerencia no hace balance entre hogar y trabajo.  Prefieren contratar gente de afuera y darles mejores beneficils y paga antes que darle el puesto a un empleado interno."
good,"Not interest to write much, you have to do someone else job for growth, but in the end, you don't deserve the position of growth."
good,"Aprendí mucho, pero en los últimos tiempo se paralizaron los planes profesionales debido a la crisis de la empresa."
good,The position was favorable until the acquisition of another lender whereby the company brought the management team over and revamped the department's direction.
good,It’s a great place to work but just depends on your location. By that I mean how well you get along with your co workers. Some employees don’t know how to separate business with personal.

good,Banco popular is a great know bank chain with great reviews and great management .very clean and professional good career move for an individual for a people person
good,Customer's service job. The job is easy enough but the company complicates it with a lack of management. Simple situations tend to inconvenience workflow for months due to issues and problems not being address until it's too late. Good for a temporary transition.
good,No tengo fundamentos para realizar una valoración precisa pues en esta empresa no estuve más de 6 meses
good,"Aunque haya tenido una buena experiencia laboral en el Banco Popular y buen ambiente de trabajo, la cultura laboral no fomentaba el desarrollo del profesional, la politica de RRHH es retrogada, el modelo de jerarquia no corresponde al modelo moderno de administracion en donde los jefes y directivos, interactuan mas directamente con el equipo, he notado pocas oportunidades de proyecciones laborales, politica de meritocracia inexistente desde mi punto de vista."
good,Elevado espírito de equipa. Forte atenção no cliente interno e externo. Excelente escola
good,"Some of the highest level executives are very conscious of employee morale and have launched several improvement initiatives.  You can learn a lot in this company; maybe even grow IF you get a good direct manager.  "
good,"El haber trabajado en una gran empresa con mas de 15.000 personas que integran la plantilla y en un entorno tan competitivo y en plena crisis me ha obligado a estar a la vanguardia de los mercados económicos, de un mayor esfuerzo y superación, ejerciendo mi trabajo con empatía, asertividad t un gran conocimiento del cliente."
good,"Going through a difficult transition - profitability, staff departures and reorganization."
good,"Longevity, and job security is very strong in this company. Medical benefits are excellent. Paid vacations, and a lot of sick days. Great corporate activities and compensations for your hard work as an employee.Top Management creates career path, supervisors do not always follow through when helping there employees."
good,Management team members are not all on the same page and they are all very disorganized. Some individuals are friendly but it is better to go work and go home. Do not become friends with these people.

good,I am sincere with my work. And do all work which is assential to my work. Management is any work my favourite work and try to do better then any body.
good,"Al ser una institucion financiera el trabajo que se realiza es mucho. Se puede ganar un buen salario, pero no necesariamente eso es lo que siempre importa. Tambien, influye tu salud mental."
good,Time to change careers. Banks only expand through organic growth or acquisitions. Banking is not a good place for me personally to work. The money was good but the company soulless.

good,"The working place is pretty good , but the salary is too low and the transportation and meal fee is high . I hope tat company will give their workers meal ."
good,"I give this company three stars because; I liked the pay and flexible hours.  However, I did not like the way I was treated by management.  The main thing was, they closed and I had to leave before I was laid off.  They would not give me my payout even though I had documented medical excuse.  They wanted me to stay even though I was very sick at the time.  They only cared about my performance; but not me as a person."
good,"You can learn about the cities of Puerto Rico. Good partners to work. Good salaries. Safe place to work. The manager is a little bit hard to work with him, but you can learn a lot."

Supposedly to clock out by 5 PM AST, I usually stay longer so I can meet with the budget and due dates requirements by management."

good,"Good organization. Good coworkers. Popular has been evolving constantly since it was founded over a century ago. From a small bank it has developed into a large Corporation that offers a great variety of financial products and services, with a presence in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America."
good,"NYCB was aquired from doral ,"
good,great workplace with understanding supervisors. training was exceptional and management had patience with trainees learning capabilities. New trainees were put in a seperate training room to learn at their own pace. After getting on the floor trainees had a special phone line and email to ask any questions instead of getting up to ask. The best part of the job for me was helping Customers in spanish speaking communities.

good,Corus Bank which is now MB Financials was a good bank to work for.  I started with Corus while I was in high school.  I worked part time and they were always willing to give me extra hours when needed.  They were very flexible.

We do have some work functions, which is always a good time."
good,Great training and people. Customers are often valued as they've been within the bank for years.
good,"If you're looking for steady no change, no challenge, no intuition. This is the place. Don't get me wrong I don't mean these as criticisms rather it is what it is. If you have a family, and wish for security (So long as you're semi competent, and don't plan on attempting to embezzle funds) It's a good job. Much older demographic."
good,"•	Operated as teller in the company for handing transactions."

good,"Overall the company benefits and compensation it’s amazing. However, the level of stress and hard work isn’t worth it. I think they can become more transparent in their communications and policies and procedures. Every branch does things differently. The uncertainty it’s high. I m trying to adapt as I need the income and enjoy banking. Not sure for how much longer with them."
good,It is a good place to start your career. It is the most important Bank in Puerto Rico and is a prestigious worked here. The company need to improve their technology resources.

After a while the development opportunities were limited to require me in the post, but after 7 years in the same place I need a change and I do not see any chances of that happening in the short term."
good,"I have been at BPPR for over 5 years and can't believe how much it has changed in last 6 months. Communication from the top down has been improving and the company has been focusing and stressing the importance of quality with its Power of the Conversation campaign. Team leads have been really engaged in making my and my co-workers day easier."
good,Algumas dificuldades de comunicação com os diversos órgãos da empresas. Inúmeros problemas informáticos.

good,"Was a nice environment to work. Everyone were helpful, nice outgoing. The only bad this is for temps and part time workers they didn't have benefits. The hardest part of my job was bill pay. The most enjoyable was restarting the password for the customers, making sure that they were satisfied and also when we had Co worker gathering.  I learned how to help customers, reset passwords, and help them make a online banking account."
good,Great place to work. Great supportive management team. I've been there a few years and it's one of the best places I've worked so far.

good,Its a very good place and company when you can learn and Grow as a professional
good,"Since there was no experience in who-sale lending, pricing and product was no available. Management was no experienced and in turn did not allow employees to get the job done properly. Banco Popular had great potential but was not ready for West Coast mentality."
good,Overall I have come a long way from part time to full time to Head Teller this job comes with a challenge but once you get the hang of things its ok. Definitely a lot of muli-task.

good,Tremenda oportunidad de desarrollo. Compańía sólida y con grandes planes futuros
good,"Its a small company to work with, pretty friendly environment. However to stressful  due to limited resources in the team and cannot focus on growth opportunity."
good,"work in office environment as a escrow assistant Monday thru Friday, but I was part time, good workplace but hard to grow as a professional because too muck employees"
good,"Day to day, I would investigate with the group what was the Act 20 and 22 based on and what products did the bank offer for our clients. I liked it because we would have weekly meetings with management and they would provide feedback on our progress and offer any help we may need"

good,"Requires teamwork"
good,Great opportunities to grow as a professional and excellent work / life balance.
good,"Fueron días con niveles de trabajo normal con medios niveles de exigencia, aprendí la importancia del trabajo en equipo con el jefe directo, la gerencia en general se ocupa de todos los temas con una visión orientada, las personas que allí trabajan son adultas y con poca proyección, la parte mas difícil fue superar los retos de temas nuevos, me gusto aprender de personas expertas y con muchas vivencias para compartir."
good,"Communication in the office isn't that great.The training I received was sopply at best but I made the best from it by practicing on my own and looking for other solutions. Team doesn't demonstrate confidence on other member's skills nor give out initial projects as templates to what the team needs for new members to complete. During my time there, I felt really lost on what the team wanted from me and didn't even knew my job description until the last month on my contract. Other deparments worked smoothly and better oriented. Workflow was ok and the job enviroment was really relaxed."
good,"The company has a great organizational culture, but management needs to improve its communication style and decision making. There are many good coworkers."
good,En general es buen patrono. Pero necesita promover el crecimiento interno y mejorar el salario.
good,I feel as  like family with all my co-workers. The supervises needs to improve the promotions and the training area. Supervises Communication with employees was badly.

good,"Excelentes programas de bienestar laboral, creación de espacios para la interacción de todos los colaboradores de la empresa."
good,"The bank is a great place to work and the pay is decent. They recognize hard work with employee recognition and are very involved in the community. If you're new to banking, this is the perfect place to start. If you're looking for growth opportunity, you'll have to wait in line. Even if you exceed goal, there's still a line."
good,"Working at Banco Popular really open my world view about money and how things work in commercial banking industry. Even though I was a teller I have goals to achieve and rewarded. Bankers, tellers and managers we all work together to get the right information to enhance our customers banking experience. And perhaps that was probably the most exciting part of my job. My managers were great and patient with everything I needed or wanted. This business is more stable than other jobs I had but the challenging part of my job is to convince people about the new products. I came to understand that to convince people is to first give them my attention, not them paying attention to me."
good,THIS COMPANY DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE. The comapany has a lot of clients and great relationships
good,Es/era una empresa que cultivaba la promoción profesional entre sus empleados

good,Overall good learning experience. Very fair vacation day allowance. Not so great salary compensation but very fair severance pay when that time came...
good,It's a nice place to work. You are generally underpaid until you reach a certain level where you start really earning money. The sacrifice is worth it! Work hard to earn!

good,"A pesar de tener un ritmo frenético a diario, nunca sabes que puede pasar, ambiente excelente con un gran grupo de compañeros."
good,Se trabaja por producción y servicio en todo momento.
good,"This company gave me corporate experience. My co-workers were great to work with. Issues are pretty much the same as all corporations and/or large businesses. I liked being a bank teller, love being around people and helping them. Loved the attitudes and humor of my co-workers."
good,Estar mas pendiente de los colaboradores de la temporal
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho;"
good,"The company is making changes to update to more modern (digital) solutions. However management is not pro-employees (does not really hear them out,  does not acknowledge good employees) and does not provide solutions to correct obsolete processes in a timely manner. Evaluations methods are outdated."
good,"A empresa e os seus profissionais, pautam-se pelos valores fundamentais de inovação, renovação, compromisso, partilha, abrangência, dinamismo, formação, rigor e qualidade que visem um desempenho de excelência, tendo por base o respeito pela dignidade humana e a responsabilidade social."

good,"My years of employment at BPPR where very profitable in terms of career advancement. BPPR promotes leadership and teamwork.BPPR's opportunity for advancement where endless. If one shows interest in changing any operational platforms or systems you where given the chance to prove yourself. Each persons professional expertise in each area where always exploited to profit one's self as well as the company. Personally I enjoyed reporting to work early and doing 101% of what was expected. Nightfall would come over and my work crew and self wouldn't even be aware of the time. Our workforce respected each others personal attributes, eg; religion, sex orientation, religion and color. One of our most difficult hurdles was reconfiguration of all programs that used a two digit date field. All these thousands of programs and sub divisional programs that had two digit fields had to be correct during the 1999 - 2000 millennium role over. It took us months to finish, but at 1200 midnight on that everlasting night, NOTHING crashed."
