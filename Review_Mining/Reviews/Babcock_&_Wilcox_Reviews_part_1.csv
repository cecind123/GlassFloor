rating,review
bad,"This used to be one of the finest companies around with exceptional benefits, but hard times have caused wages to be frozen and benefit costs to drastically increase.  Stress abounds, as with any company in crisis."
bad,They tell you all this high-tech stuff they do but it'snot there's no leadership everyone's out for themselves and nobody will help you out not a good place to work
bad,"Mgmt. sucks.  It is more important WHO you know than what you know.  Very lousy place where ""the good 'ol boy network"" is alive and well.  Would not recommend this company to my ex-mother in law."
bad,Union runs the company.  Management allows policy and processes to run only if the union says it runs. Experience has no influence nor merit. Unethical and deceiving to employees as well as the community. Poorly managed.
bad,"Middle and upper management ran a great company into the ground. Too many reasons to list. Did not listen to the employees in the field or to the customers. "
bad,CEO was recently replaced.  Company was forced to include 3 new Board Members from an outside investment firm who became the majority stockholder.  Anticipate many changes in their future
bad,Burger King and Dave & Busters!
bad,Not an employee or veteran friendly place to work. Management is terrible across the board. They do not care about their employees or the families of employees.
bad,"This company practices ""equal opportunity"" only in their HR speeches. Be prepared for a miserable worklife in an incredibly corrupt work environment where favoritism, harassment, and backstabbing are the main forms of communication. Life here involves a revolving door of layoffs approx. every year and a half. While the pay is great, the constant layoffs and politics will destroy yours sanity and financial security."
bad,A system of distrust exist at this company. The management team encourages such behavior. The old guard that supervises are mostly ex union hourly brought over from hourly to salary. A strong culture of  employees looking to get others so they can look good themselves
bad,The Barberton NOG division works in departmental Silos. There is minimal communication between departments and coordination of efforts especially between the design groups and the shop floor. Once you are hired it is every man for his self. The departments are very cliquish. There is constant backstabbing and belittling. Schedenfreude is the predominate culture.
bad,"No job security, daily activities were ok but over the past 3 years all jobs have been cut and headcount continued to reduce. No real potential for a long term career."
bad,"From 2006's best place to work in Ohio to  now one of the worst places to work anywhere.  A Once Great Place to Work, Now a Horrible Shell of a Company...stay away for the sake of your career."
bad,"Don't work at this company for more than 2 years. It is a declining industry (coal) and your work experience there will serve you very little any where else."
bad,"downsizing has eliminated an entire line of work ,  fossil work is being contracted out"
bad,Things are not like they used to be. I believe upper management has their jobs on the line and have been systematically releasing employees that stand up for what is right.
bad,"The company is horrible from top to bottom, horrible management, no advancement, tiny pay raises, no promotion for  training or certifications, promoting people with no knowledge or experience."
bad,Demoralizing management style from the top down due to outside sources used to fill senior positions by majority owners and stock holders brought in to simply make them more money and NOT employee driven or related in the least.
bad,"BWXT allowed employees to take every other Friday off."
bad,Relaxed and interesting day.  Great place to obtain considerable and wide-ranging job experience.  Management was poor.  Compensation was extremely low.
bad,Pretty cut throat place to work. Could not get totally trained in the field I was working in. People where to afraid to loose their job. Supervisor did not like me for some reason.
bad,Good company to work for.  Good people and good management.  9/80 work week is good .  They should try to diversify to non coal related markets as well
bad,"B&W has neglected to stay relevant in a changing industry and seems to reduce its staff every 18 months, so morale is typically low."
bad,I loved working at B&W for most of my time there.  But mismanagement of the company around 2015 made for a very stressful environment. The culture and attitude totally changed.  Management keeps taking away from the employees.  It's sad to say that I would not recommend a job at B&W.
bad,"Clearly, once a great place to work.   Good people built entire careers here.  Now very uncertain.   Upper management once isolated from business in Charlotte are now consolidating operations in Ohio.  Few will relocate to Ohioâ€”so leadership is in flux.  Renewable energy projects in Denmark are killing the company."
bad,Total lack of leadership and back stabbing management.  The project managers I worked with were awesome but other management would throw you under the bus even while you were listening and it wasn't your issue.
bad,The direction of the company is lacking.  Barberton employees do not leave because they are locals and do not have many other options within the desired radius.
bad,"Medical Benefits are typical but the 401k is above average."
bad,"Great people, interesting projects, challenging work, and wonderful benefits.  Poor market and lack of execution on projects hurts the whole company, even the departments that performed well."
bad,"My transfer to this company was a very anticipated move, but survival was to be my daily plight once I became employed.  Too many chiefs and not enough indians.  Talent acquisition, placement, and retention were non-existent concepts with the alleged management team.  If you possessed an ounce of intelligence, you were bound for nowhere."
bad,Typical day consists of designing and analyzing structural support systems and process pipe systems.  Designs are modeled using CAD programs to convey information to technical design drafters.
bad,"Challenging project work.  Management for the most part is ok,  Closer to lacking than of micromanagement.  Culture is old and slow to change.  Challenging place to work as they try to transition in a dying market.  Constant reorganization and management changes."
good,Not much positive to say. The company is in dire trouble and they are trying to right the ship which requires eliminating good people and moving jobs.
good,"Very long working hours (60-70 hours per week)."
good,"A typical day as a operation engineer is to walk the manufacturing shop floor, reviewing equipment operation and production progress ensuring any necessary concerns or technical issues are addressed.  "
good,Poor management. Company tends to be cheap.  Absolutely no advancement.  Co-workers tend to be very good.  Good place to learn.
good,"good company, get layed off alot, get layed off a whole lot many many times ten hrs a day 4 days a week is nice, but most management are not very nice"
good,"many lay offs over the past years and the the CEO and CFO get huge bonus.  arethey moving to Akron, smaller place so more people will be losing thier jobs"
good,"Very large Company.  Very dedicated employees in the Construction segment.  Made a lot of friends. Positive atmosphere.  They need to updated there automated payroll, accounts payable systems."
good,"Coal industry is dying and company is trying to pivot to industrial business.  Management focused on the quarter and quick fixes.  Long term sustainability takes a back seat."
good,"B&W is a great place to learn about fossil power plants.  However there are not many opportunities to advance in the company.  There has been little planning put into knowledge retention and many of the top technical minds are eligible for retirement. The future is questionable.  "
good,"The company has been going through a huge transition and downsizing for the past year. There is little to no job security at present, raises have stagnated, bonuses have disappeared and the cost of health insurance continues to rise. The greater your level of incompetence, the higher you can rise in the company."
good,"Bacock and Wilcox cambridge Ontario is the plant in which I was employed, therefore my review is of that site. It is a unionised shop (USWA). There is little in the way of upward mobility in this company. However, lateral mobility is frequent as one bumps from posotion to position in response to lay off. Ability to do this depends on seniority and skill and experience. They are a good company to work for, though in early years lay offs do come, but so do recalls. Therefore if you are willing to hang in there you can have a very long term job."
good,Not a team work company. Everybody on his own. People stabbing each other in the back.
good,Used to be a good company to work for but not so much anymore.  The power utility business is growing smaller so the company is constantly downsizing.  The 9/80 work schedule is a big benefit as you get every other Friday off.  You do have to work 9 hour days.
good,They have tought me more than i can write down great place just going through hard times chasing new markets had projects that cost the company millions
good,"Empresa con muy poco competitiva en cuestiones de prestaciones, no hay mucho para donde desarrollarte la cultura de trabajo sigue siendo la de un taller."
good,someone is taking the company down the tubes.. many layoffs in the past year and many more coming because of the company losing a ton of money on bad decisions
good,"Good pay & like the flexible 9/80 work week.  Unfortunately the company has been through many layoffs & restructurings, too many VP's & directors, mangers, etc.  Not much value on the technical employees that made the business great.  Used to be a great place to work..."
good,"This company employs some of the best people in the boiler industry. Unfortunately, due to shifting policies and attrition, they no longer hold a strong competitive edge and are bogged down in restructuring efforts."
good,"I learned a lot during my time at this firm.  However, due to a decline in the coal market, significant cuts are being made."
good,"When I began working here, it was a place where everyone enjoyed their place of employment. In the last 5 or 6 years, morale has really dropped among the employees and many people have lost the desire to work here. "
good,"It's a good starter job, but depending on what department you are in, it can be very difficult to move up in the company.  Often times management makes decisions that don't entirely make sense and promotions are given to people who don't deserve them."
good,"A company slow to change, yet overly ambitious when it does. The result is free fall, as B&W sells off subsidiaries, lays off waves of workers, axes its internally promoted CEO after only 9 months in the role, and watches its shareholder value drop to practically nothing."
good,Babcock and Wilcox  has been in business for 150 years. Great company with good benefits and amazing people. The new CEO Leslie Kass is an amazing person and will do a terrific job !
good,"There is a lot of change within management there, but they are looking to get it right. The Emerging Leaders program there is phenomenal, if you get in."
good,"Due to the nature of the power industry a once vibrant company is stuggling for work and downsizing.  "
good,A typical day is pretty hectic depending on what is happening on the specific project.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with.
good,Economy is poor at this point in time for this company. So people are being let go if they are older and replaced with younger people.  There isn't enough work right now.
good,"The work is not hard, There is a great deal of training and policies and procedures that must be followed. A tremendous amount of oversight from several different government agencies and in plant auditors. A very highly trained workforce. A very structured work environment. Safety ,security, and quality are a constant in the daily routines. The hardest part of the job is the amount of time the company demands of the employees. Overtime is a constant requirement, sometimes more than others but always there. The hardest part of the job is dealing  with managerial and supervisory changes. Sometimes they can be good and sometimes not. And dealing with the ""good ole boy network""  when it comes to promotions. The best part of the job is the pay and benefits. The worst part is the possibility of a lay off and they don't look at your time or seniority."
good,a typical day at work management hard to work for co worker were great
good,"fine place to work up until 2013, employee oriented, negative changes in 2013 affecting moral"
good,"The relationship I experienced was good overall, with the majority of experience based on project work. the largest project was based on a 3 year term at a total project value of $ 500 mill. The project was delivered on time below budget."
good,"They are great at compensating the people but, don't listen and utilize the talent they have. Too many uninformed decisions with no understanding of consequences up and down stream. Leadership placement does not align with a company looking to remain being a leader in the industry."
good,Worked long hours at the power plant setting..where production is a must and along with a safe work day...worked along with fellow ironworkers working as  a team for completing jod assignments safely.
good,"Ability to gain valuable design experience"
good,"Wilmington N.C. site closed.  "
good,"Excellent company, benefits and environment.  I loved working with them and everyone worked together to get the job done. I would highly recommend employment."
good,The company was stuck in its old routines did not allow for growth. after interviewing over 300 employees worldwide. I quickly realized that the company did not allow for growth and development.
good,"constantly on call to travel to a site to work not allowing to make plans for a personal life without taking vacation days."
good,"I worked with a small group at the company that was involved in some bleeding-edge solutions in a market space that was relatively complacent and content with the status quo.  We did some exciting things and had some great solutions, but also did not have the necessary oversight and support structure to be successful."
good,"Average pay, descent benefits with a casual dress atmosphere. There is no room for advancement and no job security unless you are willing to move out of state."
good,Construction company that used to be a strong one. Part of my early beginning in Engineering and Constuction. A hard project also since it was located in a complicated place.
good,The new management did not even consider what we were doing well before considering what changes they were going to maketo make the company more profitable.  Just more big business corruption.
good,"Many Certifications under NAVSEA Welding code"
good,not a fun place to work at. Feorce reduction every year. New management doesn't care about employees
good,Overall its a job that could turn into a career. It has great pay but not a great work/life balance.
good,"Lack of clear path for career advancement. Poorly performing company, not enough work scheduled. Lack of annual raises or holiday bonus. Multiple rounds of layoffs has me concerned about job security."
good,"The business has a lot of challenges, and hasn't been dealing with them very well.  Just had a 9% reduction in force.  Unable to assimilate the new businesses it has acquired over the last three years."
good,The company has slowly been getting worse along with the related business market.  Management cuts have affect the culture that once was an enjoyable place to work.  Employees are expected to work with far less than before while still meeting the requirements of the job.  The executive vision is unclear and employees are unsettled with where the business is headed.  Poor management all around.
good,outdated work atmosphere.  Feels like it is stuck in the '60s.  Managers' roles are not clearly defined.  A few bad apples can easily ruin projects.  There are many who are good and they feel like a family.
good,Good place for learning about large component machining. Supervised union employees on various types of CNC machines . Gained a lot of knowledge pertaining to supervising union employees and leading and developing front line supervisors.
good,Overall a good company with good people.
good,9-80 work schedule.
good,"Overall, good place to work, very good job security, and also have lots of opportunities to move to other department, not much challenge in this place."
good,Used to be great place to work.  Headwinds from coal power business and poor management decisions on WTE projects have severely impacted the company.  Such a shame.
good,It was ok. I didn't mind it.  Compensation is weak but every other Friday off is great. Only 2 weeks vacation until youve been with the company for 6 years.
good,When I started we were a division of Diamond Power. They basically left us alone to do our job. When B&W's work started to subside due to Coal in Power Plants they decided to incorporate us into their business. They started to take our work away and in the end they moved our Purchasing dept to OH. This save their jobs and left us with no job in the end.  We did a very good job. We were efficient in every way but they wanted to save the jobs in OH for their own employees. The rest of the company will eventually be migrated as well.
good,"I was here for 20+ year, and it was a great place to work until 2013, when external management took over. We are based in Barberton, OH, and HQ was moved to Charlotte, NC.  Once this occured, employee moral tanked!"
good,"Once you get trained, your pretty much on your own. I really enjoyed my work. I am a go- getter.  I really enjoyed helping the writers of the purchase orders."
good,I have had a very long and productive career at B&W.  Great people and learning opportunities for young engineers in the power production and environmental controls markets
good,"The hardest thing is I worked with mostly men. Dirty, smelly, long hours. Money was good, Union shop. I learned I could get Security Clearance."
good,"High workload requires good organizational skills. Lots of learning opportunities. No training or preparation besides ""on the job"" training. Negative atmosphere on a daily basis due to constant reductions in force."
good,My time was spent at B&W learning new things. It is a good place to learn about ins and outs of the boiler industry. I was able to travel to customer sites and learn about new processes.
good,"Working at the Babcock and Wilcox company has allowed me to understand the needs of the customers of which we serve, enable me with the tools and integrity to delivery on every project promise. but most of all this company have allowed me to grow under the mentorship of some well seasoned engineer"
good,Worked with various Designers and department managers on distributing their designs through email and processing blueprints and designs from clients
good,the job was some what interesting and although thepay is good i will gladly like the chance to work again with them in the future but im looking for anything right now that can be on with
good,"B&W has been going through some major downturns as is public knowledge as a publicly traded company."
good,"Some managers are good and some are bad.  It is a mix.  You have that in old companies.  Need more work life balance.  Currently I am not happy there, but that is more due to me than them."
good,Good place for someone looking to advance their career.  Very good work life balance. Very good training and resources. Good work life balance and work atmosphere.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, buen sistema de comunicaciÃ³n con todo el personal"
good,"This was overall a good place to work at which I leaned a lot. However significant cuts are being made all the time. I just lost my job in the last cut and I hear more are to come."
good,"This is a fast paced environment, you are required to wear multiple hats. Little chance for advancement. Friendly work environment."
good,"MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES"
good,a lot of travel sometime rewarding with extended time off and independence.  Pay compensation is good with paid overtime and per diem
good,"Wroking as a test engineer allowed me a lot of hands on oppurtunities. Such as wiring up test machinery and trouble shooting systems. Since the company is still rather small I was also responsible for generating analysis reports on the data that was collected, which brought the whole experience full circle."
good,Lots of opportunites to work with different departments. The work can sometimes be challenging but the pace of the work is somewhat slow.
good,"Pay is good but you could be making the same as someone who does half the work as you. Became a hire and fire company during the economic down turn. Their idea of innovation was to cut staff and be more efficient with less, this made it stressful on those left to do the work. Disgruntled veterans and negative attitudes."
good,"Team member worked well together for the most part to achieve our objectives."
good,"Very strict policy & procedures, updated software, have some duplicate processes."
good,Going downhill under new corporate management.  They do not seem to understand the full impacts of their decisions when it comes to the customers.   Assets and people are not used to make the most of the talents that they have.
good,Pays well for locality. Good coworkers that are essential for the work atmosphere. Advancement is relatively moderate based on skills and education.
good,Great Company...very technical.  Learned a lot of nuclear guidelines and very specific requirements to work in the nuclear community.
good,Great place to work. Great people to work with. Way too many layoffs though! Not a good place to work if you want long term employment.
good,Coordinate all required documentation for the manufacture and delivery of deliverable product
good,Gives you great training that can be used outside of work plus qualifying paperwork that follows you.
good,"Work at B&W was very stressful.  A serious of poor management decisions caused B&W to suffer significant financial losses. As an executive, I was responsible to assist in mitigating such losses.  Each day brought fresh challenges....."
good,"Work is not too hard"
good,Working day is ever changing and challenging.  The environment is close knit and fun. You get to interact with IT people or the business.  Teams are always willing to help.
good,"Allows the freedom to do you job with minimal supervision, Copy give yuo the ability to have flexible hours that work with your schedule and theirs. Very relaxed atmosphere."
good,The IST facility program is a cutting edge investigation into the anticipated functionality of small modular reactors. Being part of the team requires exposure to all forms of engineering and provides challenges with each new testing sequence.
good,"This company treats its salaried employees well with many perks. It offers the 9/80 work schedule and you're off for the whole week of Christmas (holiday pay). They promote continuing education and training. They have a nice workout center, onsite physical therapist and doctor clinic, etc. "
good,"Okay Job, Good Pay and Benefits - No advancement opportunity"
good,"10 hour days under manned always on the go."
good,"B&W is a well respected company that has a great workforce.  Over the last few years, financial issues have led to downsizing, but the turnaround is in process and they will emerge from it a strong, solid company.  The people who work there are very dedicated to the company and want to anything/everything to see it succeed."
good,"Unfortunately there will be downsizing. Which puts me out of a job. Still love the company, people I work with are like my family, and the pay is fair."
good,"Jeg har altid vÃ¦ret super glad for mit arbejde hos BWV og det var trist at sige farvel efter 31,5 Ã¥r i firmaet pga. dÃ¥rligt regnskab. "
good,Gnerally enjoyable environmnt.  Managemnt is inconsistent in decisions then firm in enforcing final decision.   frustrarting when you are the scapegoat in the end.  Wasting of money is seen again and again.  Favorites are often pickd instead of the one who actually can do the job.  Management does not seem to care when real facts are presented showing how to save money.  I was often swept to the background when I brought case studies on how a situation could be handled better with historical evidence proving the case.  Never was a compensation increase given with a responsibility increase.  My family often suffered with my longer hours which were expected and not rewarded.
good,The company for the most part of my career was a very stable and enjoyable place of employment. Unfortunately the shift in the power generation segment from coal to alternative fuels has caused this 150 year old company in the direction a replacement parts business.
good,Generally kind and accomodating culture with the occasional write-up for having spent a work-day in the hospital.  Not forgiving to employees with disabilities.
good,The Financial group has a very good working relationship and work well together.  They pitch in to help all team member meet department goals and assist each other
good,"The typical day starts with reviewing night shift notes, walking the shop floor to check status of the projects, taking care of any engineering needs, preparing a projection report for Thursday meeting. Reviewing up-coming over-time, schedule and engineering needs. Holding periodic team meeting with shop supervision and hourly employees to review remaining scope and hours on current jobs, as well, as determining needs on any up-coming jobs."
good,"I was hired to implement a new dock operation for a  company that previously used 3rd party operations. the company made parts for the military that required a lot of DOD interactions. This required a security clearance for me. Once getting things into place the actual level of work dropped drastically. One part that was shipped to the customer took 5 years to make, so there was little action through the dock on daily basis. It was very cool to see and experience the nature of what we were producing. Unfortunately not enough work for me."
good,Good work invironment. Managment was helpful but not looking over your sholder.  Great co-workers.
good,I enjoy what I do and who I work with. Would like more in-depth training in some aspects of my job
good,"My typical day was very busy.  Primary contact for IT department.  Coordinated and deployed all help desk calls.  Ordered and received and deployed PC equipment.  "
good,"A typical day in the office was to review field packages to ensure they meet our Quality Assurance Manual, also to verify trades were training as per the procedure written for the project to be executed on site.. During the review process I was constantly referenced to areas of or QAM and codes, all that cross reference added to a greater knowledge of our process. My manager was very knowledgeable in QA/QC and very willing to assist and explain all questions asked of her. My co-workers were easy to get along with and also very helpful when asked for assistance. The hardest part of my job was preparing to be away from home on long outages ( 2 months or more). The part I enjoyed most about my job was knowing I had input on the finish product."
good,"The company has been through hardships, but the people are what make this company great. I had a manager that gave more so many opportunities to grow and nurtured my curious spirit to learn. I am grateful for the opportunities I was given at this company. Important to state that this company has the best schedule!"
good,I enjoy working at Babcock & Wilcox and love my job! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I am looking to move up in the company but there is no opportunity to do so here. The company has downsized many times over the last several years.
good,"Culture of collaboration and mutual respect between employees/departments."
good,"Mat leave which was extended another year when incumbent either chose to stay home or requested additional year, I do not remember."
good,Some days were great and some days were average. I learned how to fabricate materials and weld. It was a great environment to work in. The job wasn't hard. Working with and around people was very enjoyable.
good,Babcock & Wilcox is a great company with a strong; professional workforce. They are flexible in balancing both work requirements along with each individuals home life.
good,"A contractor for the Department of Energy will try your patience but stick with it and apply yourself and you will go a long way."
good,"Over the last 26 years the acquaintances I have made, have made a very positive impression on myself. There have been times of learning and times of teaching that have been especially rewarding. In the last years of downsizing that seem to ""shade"" the atmosphere slightly, the exceptional character of my bosses and co-workers have made it more than palatable. As a maintenance technician I have had the honor of rubbing shoulders with some of the most accomplished engineers and trouble-shooters around. It's been very real here."
good,BWCS is a good company to work for.  The plant offers clean working environment and the company offers a great insurance plan and 401K.
good,"I start my day by recording all staff on site on the attendance register. I will then prepare any minutes needed for any meetings that day. I take notes during the meetings and write them up afterwards forwarding them to the subcontractors and filing them into the system. Any other administrative duties that management haven't got time for gets passed on to me such as filing, printing, ordering drawings and adding other documentation to the system. The hardest part of the job is the language barrier, I hoped to learn more during this contract but most of the technical info been in danish and polish etc."
good,"Busy days planning 5 year projects."
good,Good backup in safety from management. Well defined safety documents with clear instructions.
good,"Set up CNC lathes,milling machines and horizontal boring mills."
good,I really enjoyed the work and people at the B&W Clinch River project.
good,Reviewed inventory balances daily; order inventory and non-inventory parts; ran reports for various functions & managers; set up weekly meetings with supliers & vendors; created spreadsheets with compiled information to allow us to ship on time
good,I really had an opportunity to make a good living but it move to Mexico ðŸ¥µðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜¡ ! I had purchased a new home. My family and I relocated to live closer to the job. It was so painful to loss the job because it went to Mexico. ðŸ¤•ðŸ˜ªðŸ¥´
good,"Great place to work.  I was there in 2008, before ""the crash"".  The commute was not the best since roads that i was not familiar with were always shut down.  Good training, great people."
good,"Project and Industry driven company. During my time being here at Babcock and Wilcox, they are all great people to work with. (Especially the supervisors, managers and upper level management)"
good,I enjoyed working with this company.  Was able to participate in many different locations.  I was able to meet lots of interesting people and solve many different problems.  I felt like a team member and was always given monetary rewards.
good,"The company was generous in giving 9/80 work weeks. I loved the people associated with B&W.  Very good and fair management. My typical day at work or on trips was nothing but enjoyable.  At times there were long days being at trade shows and events, I have enjoyed talking to people and how we as B&W can help you!"
good,Nothing to say. Wasn't there long enough to form solid opinion. This box wants me to say more but I have nothing more to say. This is ridiculous to require a minimum.
good,"â€¢	Issuance of Control Documents and Drawings to internal/external and shops "
good,"Given the products manufactures at this facility, it's the kind of place that you would imagine... Can't say much more."
good,"I have learned to see even the smallest imperfection and the importance of documentation. We are held to the highest of standards at this company, I an under a strict confidentiality requirement and am unable to discuss my position."
good,"Competent personnel."
good,"Jobs mostly involved understanding the different methods of non destructive testing of steam generator feeder tubes installed at various nuclear power plants located across Ontario and designing/implementing engineering software to manage the data collected. worked as part of a highly efficient and innovative team. Enhanced project management, and time management skills. Job involved learning a great deal of new software technologies, programming languages, and enterprise software architecture. Great place to work flexible hours, and good pay for an engineering intern."
good,"B&W mPower is the branch developing the next generation of small modular reactor (SMR) for power generation.  B&W built a scale test model, without nuclear capabilities, to test various thermal hydraulic features, in an effort to expedite NRC licensing.  The engineers and operators assigned exhibited a high degree of can-do attitude, overcoming numerous challenges in this first of a kind test facility.  The small plant would be started up Sunday nights at midnight, and by Monday evening it was ready to conduct testing.  Through the week various tests would be conducted, both steady-state and transient.  The shift work was not so enjoyable, but it was only Monday through Friday with weekends off, so it was doable without too much interruption in one's social life."
good,"very busy working environment, team players, organized work environment."
good,"Enjoyed my stay here due to organizational changes had to depart. "
good,"Very busy days, made days go by fast, learned to deal with customers complaints, management telling how to do my job, but didn't know my job. co-workers were enjoyable to work with, hardest part of the job was getting customers to pay there invoices on time, the most enjoyable part of the job was providing customers there shipments on time and providing customer service."
good,"A typical day of work was to performs tasked assigned to me. I learned to read blue prints, weld and fitting. My sup supervisor was a pleasant person to work for. My co-workers - easy to get along with and a pleasure to have worked with them. Hardest part of the job was the huge steel drums we assembled. Enjoyable part of work was be involved in that industry."
good,"Babcock & Wilcox is a good place to work, great culture, flexible schedule, a lot of things to learn when you work for B&W. You work hard you can be promoted."
good,The best choice I ever made was leaving my last job for a job at B&W. I have met and collaborated with some amazing folks with a wide range of experience.
good,"After graduation from college, I accepted my first job at Babcock & Wilcox. I was very fortunate to have an excellent unit manager to mentor me and I am very grateful for this experience. I had an excellent team to work with on various classified programs."
good,Discussing what needs accomplished for the day. Making decisions on the spot with and without Supervision. Working at bettering my methods of work while still putting in quality work while being productive. Keeping organized to make my job more productive and effective.
