bad,"USG is not a happy place to work. I do not recommend working at USG. I began working at USG in early 2014 senior manager of technology commercialization. Management is very clicky and toxic. I have seen women mistreated, heavy drinking after hours, and gossip. The CEO has failed to lead management. I have began to build my own construction company on the side so I can get away from the USG employee click. Until then I will continue to go into work pretending to be a happy and motivated member of the team who cares about USG business goals, optimization, and the market."
bad,"DontDont ever work here, TRUST ME!! This job is not a good job, if this was the last job on earth i would jump off any bridge."
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated from USG because of my attendance. Period. It did not matter that the lack of my attendance was due to illness from their product, and that I am under suspicion for exposure to heavy metals from my doctor. They wanted a meeting to fire me, I was not really allowed to speak. Everytime I trued to bring up this issue, I heard, you don't have that documented, or I don't like what you're implying!! Well, it us what it is, not an implecation, a fact. They were smug, scoffed and at times even laughed and smirked. When asked by smug face HR Rep, don't you want to hear your appeal options, one included was to see the plant manager. The plant manager if very new, and NOT part of their 3 ring circus. However I was notified at that time, the normal plant manager was out, and there was a fill in, authorized to make decisions on his behalf. I said no, I wanted to see the regular plant manager. I was told I would get NO waiting period to do this, and if I didn't see the fill in that day, I was waiving my right to see the plant manager at all. I went back. They began to speak, I tried to explain my medical situation, believed to come from their plant, their product. I again was snapped at, I don't like what you're implying!! Okay well I don't like liars, who claim safety is #1, unless it's your safety; then it's shut them up, shut them down, get them out of here! The phrase between all of these men, We already discussed this., kept coming up. And I threw my hands up. This was a meeting already had, already decided, they just had to have it again formally with my"
bad,"Management was the worst and the coworkers were even more terrible "
bad,Rainier plant is horrible! Management lives in their own dream world. They are more concerned about ridiculous programs than making a product. I would highly recommend staying away they will drive you over the edge.
bad,This job has gone downhill fast. We have not worked over 36 hours in two months. Management is joke our general foreman hasnt worked more than 2 days this whole year and they can nevet give us straight answers. The job itself is easy but its the games they play and inconsistent hours is what makes this company not worth it
bad,"I  wouldn't  recommend  this place. They paint you a perfect  potrait of encouragement, money and everything  else  but it is really just a mirage.  It is impossible  to please the  management  there and once something goes against you, no matter if it's  your fault or not, it's almost  like you have a bullseye on your back. Most of the  people  that  work there seem like they were easy to  get along  with and seem to  act like they are  your friend or at least want to  be till you  see them out in public, then they will walk over the  top of you or completely  ignore you like you do not or ever existed."
bad,To much politics its all about who you know and if they like you not a good place to work at all in my opinion it pays good but there is a reason for the high turn over rate
bad,"Poor management, bad training, workers are not friendly move you out if the way instead of training you. Supervisors are put in the role because of length of service not qualifications. Bathrooms are worse than a rest area stop on the highway. This is the walworth plant in Wisconsin. Had to run out of the place. Supervisors ignored me for a few weeks. Some employees get to sit in a air condition room with management while others are working in the heat."
bad,This is not a place that you will want to go to work unless you are out of options High turnover  There is a reason for this. Poor management top down
bad,"So many flaws at the East Chicago Plant. It was always a shady place to work from the beginning but has gotten worse over the years. If your relative got you in and they kool with the supervisor even tho you a lazy and non productive no one will every say anything to you. You can even be half blind and work here. If relatives work in the same department then you will get special treatment even tho again your not the best worker. Lots of favoritism if you  don't kiss butt and talk about everyone and run in the office and tell then they won't like you. Management looks out for the men women have to work hard as heck in Joint treatment. Supervisors talk about employees with other employees also yell at certain employees  look out for employees who really can't do they jobs but pass them on anyways so they can get a rate,everyone acts so scary and nervous it's like a circus. There lots of downtime and the equipment goes down every second, only certain ppl will help you if you have problems management turns they head on Alot of issues no one has your back it's you against them, they make you run certain jobs for weeks which are really hard while other ppl get paid for the same jobs but never work them or rarely that's not right ,they try to force you to do things that you can't do they say it's a family environment that's not true more like the feds staking you out and ready to take you out. Oh and if you make a mistake they act like you blew up everyone's car in the parking lot, they do pay well but some ppl gotta work extra hard for they money. EVERY MAN FOR THEMSELVES AT THIS"
bad,"There corporate office needs to look at this plant."
bad,The employees run this place not the  management the management don’t keep they word this place is ran very very poorly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,The work itself isn't hard but they talk about safety is #1 no it isn't at no time r u to work on moving equipment unless it's ok with management then they turn there head while the work is being done and if u want xtra hours on down time when maitenece work is being done u better b one of those that kiss a lot of butt or ur not working that means no pay
bad,No room for advancement unless u know the supervisor or foremans. Everyone knows how the old saying goes and it’s the same here. Supervisors don’t know how to do their job or are just to lazy to do it and pawn it off on other ppl.
bad,"Usg is a great company but i will never ever work for l and w especially the boca branch"
bad,As long as you become friends with the right people you will have better job opportunities. They tend to promote people who are their friends more then people who have the knowledge to make the plant better.
bad,"Pay and benefits are good, hence the 2-star rating, otherwise it would be 1-star. Work culture was terrible, management was no better . Hired managers fresh out of college with no people skills, and who are more concerned with self promotion than the people or the job at hand. Their positions are just stepping stones for the next level jobs. The managers seldom stayed longer than a year and then are moved to other plants. The workers at this facility have not gotten a full bonus in over a year and half or possibly longer because of poor management. But I'm almost certain management teams receive a bonus because they have ""cut cost"", according to the plant manager.  New management has no idea how to run a department and likewise will not listen to floor personnel. No consistency in leadership roles and the company places immature people in supervision positions. Buddy system runs amuck throughout the facility, person who kisses the best butt gets preferential treatment. Work environment was so bad I quit the job to find better employment with a company who sees the workers as the best asset and not the production numbers for self promotion. This location was usually in the top 2 or 3 in the corporation for production and efficiency, and some instances #1, but yet are told to do better and work harder. It's bad when you exceed your production goal but then are told that it was a terrible production day. This is exactly what was told to the department by the department foreman. Kind of like telling a 3rd grader that made 105 out of a possible 110 that their grade was not good enough"
bad,"service truck mechanic : fuel & lube all heavy equipment once a shift ,keep track of engine hours of all heavy equipment in quarry and all quarry vehicles.perform all oil changes.keep records up to date"
bad,"If you have children or things that require you to have time off I do not recommend USG. They will point you out even if you have a emergency (children in accident, death in family, etc) and only care that you are a body working."
bad,"I was there for a little over 4 months and did not enjoy the experience as I originally hoped. Even though I was still training as a Paper Hanger, I viewed the job as being overkill as there is too much to do for that one job. The kicker? Only one person does that job which can place a lot of stress on that sole operator. "
bad,"At first USG was the ideal place to work for. Until  you start sticking up for yourself about being treated unfair. A lot of overtime, the pay and benefits are great! If you are someone that can keep your mouth shut even though there is a lot of favoritism going on and miscommunication then you are the ideal candidate. They have fired a lot of good hard workers that spent over a decade there, fired them like it was nothing without even being disciplined first. Gotta keep nagging them about learning more jobs for a pay increase also. It's different if they push you to learn a job but it's another story if you want to learn and ask!"
good,Great pay for the job you do. The training process is very slow. Have to learn all 5 jobs on each line to earn your raises. Can be a raise every 6-8 months. Very slow process. Should have all 5 raised by the time your one year anniversary comes. Management shows obvious favoritism. Very very clicky with wrestlers from the area. Make you work weekends to either run production or to clean. Almost never get a whole weekend off without feeling guilty about it. Expect people to work too many hours for no reason. Safety wasn't great.
good,The people you work with tend to be the best part of the job. Can be a very dirty place which is to be expected from a drywall factory. Department is a big key in your day to day schedule and work life.
good,"A typical day at the job, clock in, safety huddle, pass on new safety information, possible injuries that may occur, mandatory stretches, go to your designated workstations and make sure equipment is in top working condition."
good,USG was a good place to work because I learned a lot but the only problem was a lack of team work from my coworkers
good,"The usg plant in el centro is mostly people related to eachother.. as soon as i was hired everyone kept asking who was i related to.. they were surprised i got in with no help. Management sucks they all claim safety and follow lock up procedures and they dont! All talk just during meetings but on the floor half the stuff they say is done. Pay was good hours were good, great benefits, and 401k. Just a shame the people they have running the el centro plant"
good,"Nadat USG de beurs op ging veranderde de mentaliteit van deze organisatie. Het was een geweldige organisatie met doorgroeimogelijkheden en luisterde naar de werknemers."
good,"Usg was een detacheringsbedrijf Ik werkte bij USG ook al voor "
good,"Economy hit USG hard forcing layoffs of many good people"
good,"Its well reputed organization with well managed, atmosphere balanced work enjoyable work style with all. "
good,"Flexible work hours, but outdated systems and budget cuts. Business is heavily tied to housing industry which creates some volatility."
good,The company as a whole is okay. People are treated pretty fairly. Compensation is so-so. Micromanagement was a problem.
good,There are very few opportunities for advancement for an Engineer in anything other than management. Management can be young and inexperienced. This leads to little to no mentorship.
good,"Great company to work for. Presently going through cuts and my position/department was completely eliminated. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed and was challenged daily in my role."
good,It pays very well but you work swing shift. All about safety there are no accidents that is what they say. Great job and you have to be ready to move fast and think on your feet when something happens. Overall a great place to work.
good,"USG is a great place to work. It has a very productive and energetic atmosphere for a career and upper advancement. It is at the fore front of new age technology when it comes to how fiberglass and sheetrock are made, produced, shipped and used throughout the world. USG operates in 11 states and 27 different countries with each one having its own potiential flare for production and most of all safety. USG as a whole has been operating safely wit no OSHA recordable since April 30, 2001 and remains one of the top rate safest places to work in the world."
good,"Am a hardworking person with maximum potential , experience , knowledge , Ethical and who can stand all working conditions at al times ."
good,fare enough not a bad company but Timing is so long weekly off is difficult to get but working environment is good some times you guys struggled to getting vacation
good,"Very good environment for a new engineer to go into and advance into people management. Because of the gap in 2008 downturn, lots of positions for advancement. 50/50 on middle of nowhere or a being near a major city. "
good,"Good benefits,  challenging.  Long commute. The typical day may include just about anything.  Very busy at various intervals.  Good workers, good management."
good,Buen crecimiento laboral person accesibles para darte más conociento de la empresa y área que desenpeñas
good,"Good job for the money, a more effective and more personal management  would make me happier. Top dogs like to walk all over you. A company that expects the best but doesn't treat you well on good performance. Overall a decent work place. I'm sure there is better and much worse too. I tolerated it for 5+ years now"
good,"werkzaam bij het SSC, aardige collega's die zich bewust zijn van de problematiek waar de directie mee belast is. Echter onvoldoende terugkoppeling vanuit directie waardoor er een leemte is tussen theorie en praktijk."
good,"USG is a good company to work for. When looking into a place of employment individuals applying for a job ask themselves what is the pay? How about the hours? And do they have good benefits? In my current experience with the company those questions are all met. The pay is actually very good. The hours are decent but that's always a give and take depending on business. As for the benefits, USG has a pretty good setup as in insurance, incentive bonuses, and just all around appreciation for its employees. Not always is the job rainbows and sunshine but I think financially and security wise USG can give you that. The company has been around for over 100 yrs and hasn't went belly up. That's something to be looked at when applying here. Sure certain departments got downsized but that's just how things work with businesses and the economy. I would encourage individuals to think about emolument here. I currently work in the Gypsum Fiber Products department in Gypsum, Ohio."
good,The management should really go much deeper regarding the employees needs and satisfaction and also should recognize the skill and ability each employees has within them.
good,USG is a great company but unfortunately it is tied to the cyclical housing market.  
good,Free oatmeal with some nice fixings and a cup of coffee for breakfast would start my day.  A very nice lunch at one of the many places to eat that are just down the street.  A pleasant walk in the afternoon.
good,"You will feel like you're at work more than anywhere else, but you are paid well. Work pace can vary, The hardest part is getting used to standing all day. Do not wait for management to give you more responsibilities, ask for advancements."
good,Me i resigned the last job for finding better opportunity .usg company where i work its a nice company also.i got an offer letter from one government organisation that's why i resigned in uae have experience in driving for 5years and in India I have the experience in banking and sales and marketing for more than 10years
good,"work at the hotel under united security group has helped me expand my work ethics and dealing with guests of all walks of life,e,g Rude, hostile, polite and humble. Co-workers are a great supportive time, but communication is a big problem< long working hours with little pay. above all team work is a great experience"
good,This is very interesting and so important in the way gurds can can help others in answering questions about security job opportunity and experience new skills
good,i havent worked here long but it was a great  experience. i never felt small in such a big new environment. they taught me the skills ii have now  im happy
good,Great place to work great people and pay. Out of town and overbite stays stank bc of not seeing my family but the podium and pay scale was well worth it
good,A historic company with a great culture and amazing people.  Headquartered in downtown Chicago across the street from Union Station.  A great place to work!
good,There is a reason they are always top 5 in safety and production the management is awesome and the operators all work together and back one another up i wish i didnt have to leave i could of seen myself there for a long time.
good,Productive and growth environment.  Supervisors had excellent interpersonal skills.  Pleasant working enviornment and staff training highly encouraged.  Clean atmosphere and procedures.
good,"Had plenty of work to do which kept me engaged in my role. Management was friendly, everyone there was easy to get along with. Had proper specialty tools provided."

good,"I was honored to be hand picked as the Director of the Program. The Program was recognized as one of the most effective and successful programs in the intelligence community. The staff was highly skilled, experienced and mission focused."
good,I loved working at USG!! The environment was friendly and very nice. The benefits were fantastic and there was always something new to learn. Great teamwork
