rating,review
bad,"I worked at this company for about 1 month they lied about my rate they were suppose to pay 15.50 for driving they gave me 12. then said only 14 50 because i never actually drove. Doesn't matter i got hired at 15.50 no company trains you at lower rate. Shady company Shady management with the exception of the sales manger. Sacramento Ca Store "
bad,Horrible company cut commission and bonus to the point we had to close the store. They didn't care and now the landlord is on me for the remaining year on the lease. I now know why they are the worst business in the country.
bad,"The most unprofessional job I've ever worked at. This is basically a franchise. The owner and boss is a complete control freak and has to be involved in everything :sales, deliveries, installs, management. Is he trained or has knowledge in any of these? Doubt it. But does that stop him from trying to control everything? No. He is also extremely rude to employees and customers, often yelling or making degrading comments. There is no HR department to complain to. And if you make it clear you don't like him you are fired (usually finds a lame excuse so he doesn't get sued in sure). There is also zero benefits, and the pay doesn't match the cost of living and is well below average for the area. The rest of the staff is nice but because of the low pay most don't have the proper training or experience to do their job good. I'll be surprised if they stay open much longer."
bad,"The pay is no good, they trying to run a store thats falling apart,they don't want pay there receivers in which they are the back bone for the store,we get a visit from a DM every month that comes to the store and only talks about the store not concern about the employees issues.They hired anybody off the streets to fulfilled a spot in which they have no experience"
bad,I can’t stress enough on how very unorganized it is. The manager has no communication skills and talks about their own employees behind their back to other employees. Very childish and expects others to do managements jobs with short notice. Would never recommend to anyone. Also there’s personal relationships between management that makes it unprofessional and uncomfortable to the employees.
bad,Not worth the time nor effort put into the company. Only viable when you have another job and you only need this one so you can have spending money. There is no commission what so ever and there is no training at all. No benefits nor 401K.
bad,"There are so many things i could say. But im gonna leave it at this, they steal your hours and tell you they are moving them to next week if your close to overtime because they wont allow ovet time."
bad,The manage ment here at the Texas city store is horrible and unprofessional if you stand up for yourself they'll cut you down to 10 hours a week. Bads
bad,While working for this store my partner and I would put in very long hours and did not get compensated for the overtime. Also was a big lack in comunication on deliveries and jobs to be done. We were let go with no reason or communication as to what was going on.
bad,"Very unhappy"
bad,I actually put my two weeks in and left a job to come to this company! Partially because it was more money hourly and all sorts of promises were made ! After a month of working for them and all the excuses that they were new to delivery and to bear with them ... IT ONLY GOT WORSE ! Even though my partner and I were the 1# delivery team we never got any bonus for our going above and beyond to make deliveries happen during harsh weather and ridiculous circumstances! They want you to work hard and never advance! There no benefit at all ! The managers don’t do their jobs and push their responsibility off on others and it seems like the only thing they excel at is passing the buck ! And the pay wasn’t worth it at all . The moment your close to getting a full week in they text u last min and tell u your off tmw ! Extremely unprofessional! I wish I had room to really go into detail of all the unsafe and unprofessional behavior they display every day!
bad,"The online training is long and intense.  when you are finished with it you are literally thrown to the wolves.  The actual training on the sales is either poor or not sufficient.  There is constant miscommunication.  It is impossible to remember everything in the online training modules, as a result, the potential for giving out bad information is great.  Since you tend to train as you go, the potential for mistakes is higher as well.  Working here is not for the faint of heart.  Please don't take the job unless you are prepared to put up with everything I just described.  it's a horrible place to work."
bad,"My strong advice:  stay away.  The company is in a steep decline and is run by corrupt and ineffective leadership.  The parent company, Sears Holding, is run by an unethical leader who has destroyed the company & its subsidiaries."
bad,I have worked for Sears Hometown Stores for 10 years and in that time the Corporate employees have destroyed the integrity  and the respect that american's have come to love.
bad,"Poor work environment.  Late/short pay.  Unorganized.  No set schedule.  Won't know until late the night before, or sometimes an hour before if you're working or not."
bad,I cant disclose any of this information legally. Your site should have option for such circumstance instead of forcing me to leave a review when there would be legal repercussions.
bad,"Typical day was stress from the moment you walked in till moment you walked out on average 12 hours later.. No one should consider future employment here as similarly to Sears Holding, Hometown is going through massive reduction in workforce and layoffs.  You come into work not knowing whether or not that day is your last.  Company culture sucks, no one seems fun or reasonable to work with especially management.  TOO too many ""chiefs"" and not enough ""Indians"", AKA way too many managers and not enough workers."
bad,Don’t own a sears hometown store. They lie to you about how productive the store will be. I couldn’t even afford to pay an employee. Worked 7 days a week and nothing to show for it.
bad,"It is a fun, great place to learn things about appliances and yard equipment. But the owner is a stubborn jerk who doesn't know a thing about customer service, how to treat his employees, or even the Sears operations."
bad,"Sears Hometown was not what I had expected it to be. It was not like the original Sears store that had closed down a few years back. It was just a simple, little outlet store. We had many setbacks due to our delivery truck breaking down during the winter, so we had to reschedule many deliveries that would sometimes frustrate customers. Our worst setback was when we were no longer allowed to deliver on Malmstrom Air Force Base. They were our biggest customer & to not deliver to them would cost us greatly."
bad,horrible corporate structure.  Upper managmenet not true to their word.  Horrible experience over all.  work life balance non existant.  I hated my time with this company
bad,They are very disloyal even if you work very hard and are there top producers! No opportunity to move up and advance. No benefits even if you work 50 hours a week.
bad,Sears was not the best place to work at. they were very slow place and had bad management. customers were not satisfy with the company. They need more help and management.
bad,Nothing positive about this company. Senior management treats associates like disposable parts. Company direction is based on demands from BOD which does not always translate into solid business plans. No input from Director level down is solicited
bad,Don't work for SEARS. They operate out of the 80's with their technology and pay the state minimum. Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible
bad,Customers are often mislead for store owners personal gain.  Shady back door sales.  There is no lunch hour.  The warehouse is a very dangerous and unsafe place to work.  Proper tools are not supplied to create a safe work place.
bad,Not a good place to work. No time off period. Has numerous ways to take away you commission. Expects a lot from employees but gives nothing in return.
bad,Sears outlet is a ok place to work. With many positions to work in. Management could be alil better but other than that the place is fun and hard working environment.
bad,"The Sears Store in Silver Spring/White Oak, Maryland had/has managerial & supervisory staff in their footwear department that are extremely unprofessional. The manager of this department between June and November of 2015 when I was there constantly failed to maintain a schedule that reflected the availability of the workers. He provided poor and inadequate training and engaged in childish gossip about the performance of his subordinates to other subordinates in the same department. This was a terrible place to work in my experience and I really hope that professionalism is something that becomes expected of all managers."
bad,Working long hours with low pay in bad working conditions with unrealistic goals. Management and ownership did not care about employees or customers. Short sightedness from ownership.
bad,I was not ever trained in this position  only thing I was shown was how to use the antique registers . There are a lot of burned out lights  and poor lighting outside . Management will not work around your availability . Lots of phone calls from angry customers not getting their deliveries on time . Store is huge half is cut off off looks horrible . Lots of walking break room is in the far corner  bathroom opposite corner . Apparel section looks like a high class Salvation Army  lots of racks  cheap clothes  customers throw items on the floor open up packages  or bring items to register than change their mind . back room is organized  but tons of stock that will never make it to the floor . Co workers are young kids that do not show up on time and written up or non English speaking workers that will not help out customers .  Management complains all the time about labor and sends home employees
bad,"I recently quit working at the local Sears Hometown store because of severely poor management. The owners fail to see how to properly manage their employees and to provide consequences when wrong is done. I had to pick up EVERYONE'S slack at this store. I was only part-time, but I had been there over a year and knew the store inside and out, more than the other employees there. I had enough the other day and quit!"
bad,A typical day at work was basically sitting around and we waiting on customers. I did not learn anything from the job. Management had their problems and issues. My coworkers were geared to kissing up to management. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my boss daughter lying on me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers
bad,"Warranty ""protection agreements"" are the priority as an employee, not the customer. The main goal of management is to pad their pockets, not assist the people who work for them or keep them in business. Overpriced products and lack of resources to do the job correctly."
bad,After some time you realize that the staff and owner don't have the business ethics or customer service skills to continue working for such little pay.
bad,"Sears was a fun workplace till Sears corporate took over. They have closed the store, made everyone mad and they are just some bad people. I would not recommend this store to anyone."
bad,"the work wasn't bad and employees were great to work with, but management was not very trustworthy. I was intentionally kept from doing my job properly. As shipping/receiving warehouse manager I was scheduled away from incoming freight shipments and not able to do my job properly"
bad,"Be aware of this company, do not work for sears outlet they are not to be trusted and will screw you over. The big wigs are clearing house and can’t be trusted."
bad,"The sales people were paid 4.50 per hour plus 1% commission."
bad,"I was not given the wage or hours I was told I would receive when I accepted the position. They push you to do what's best for them, not the customer. I did not enjoy working there at all."
bad,Since Sears is cutting its company in half. Local people have been taking the cake but the owner doesn't care about how you feel or want to move up. Its hard to back up this job.
bad,This company is the worst company I have ever worked for. cant find one positive thing to say and that is just sad. Executive management and human resources are corrupt and slave drivers. You will never have any support or training.
bad,If you don't mind having your hands tied and letting poor employees run your store than this is the company for you. Trying to make a store a positive location is next impossible when corp will not allow you to get rid of the problem employees instead they cater to them.
bad,"My coworkers were the only good part about my job while I was there. Upper management SUCKS. They even tried to cheat some of us out of our pay. You get zero benefits as an employee, not even an employee discount. The company loves to hold onto every last penny. A lot of the time when we would have an appliance sale, some of the base prices would go up, then the sale price would basically be the same as the base price it was before. It was either that, or they were already overpriced to begin with. Customers would come in and say Lowe’s or Home Depot have it cheaper and leave. And moral of that story? The store went out of business and we all lost our jobs. The store closed on June 21st and I only got a $100 bonus for staying an extra few days to help load all the remaining merchandise onto trucks to be transferred out (they REFUSED to bring in temps)! This isn’t even the half of all the problems we ran into, I could go on so much more. I am still without a job and just applied for unemployment. They gave zero help when it came to us finding new jobs. I would never ever recommend working for this company to anyone. The company is lucky to last another 5 years anyway, because all they care about is their MONEY! They don’t care one single bit about their employees and constantly work against them. There’s my review!"
bad,"Management does not know what they are doing from day to day, they are unwilling to advertise there are no benefits even if you are in a management role, no employee discounts, no vacation time, they expect the people that work there to go out and hand out sales flyers basically begging for business, I DO NOT recommend this failing company to anyone!"
bad,I enjoyed the position I was involved in; as the position was made challenging by those who need to do their part in order for me to be productive. The culture was poor due to corporate lack of caring for its employees. Procedures were not consistent which caused confusion and frustration between employees.
bad,They are smaller stores so the work is a lot easier. The training is minimal & there is still no promotions. A lot of favortism from upper management.
bad,Over working people not having proper equipment to clean with or dont have items needed to send to stores. Management talking to you disrespectfully .WAY TO MANY CHIEFS NOT ENOUGH INDIANS
bad,"No a good place to work for, due to the lack of knowledge of its own business. Also there is no wiliness to change or improve the business and there no opportunity for professional development."
bad,"The managers will promise you things that they can't deliver just to get you to work there. The pay is horrible, and when you make a sale you have a 75 percent of chance that the item will be returned due to the item being defective. (which they do take commission) Management does not take a fair look at the overall benefit of the Team..favoritism is an issue even at the expense of your commission. This place is a joke. So much to say and not enough space to say it. It is a dead end job with very low pay and no benefits. If you want to work just to get by until a better job comes then go for it. They will hire any live body that walks in ..but be advised it's not the kind of job that will hold up you and your family."
bad,"The job is ok once you’re trained but the training is lacking. No raises. Management is horrible. They do not care about employees or the customers.  Very poor communication between departments which results in stores"
bad,I started working at Sears towards the end of high school and the job was too demanding for my school schedule. At times they scheduled me for 30+ hour shifts when I was in high school and was unable to work fulltime.
bad,"Working here is the crappiest job ive ever had. Management doesn't care about what happens to you and just wants the job done. Leads yell in your face and so many people love to be tattletales. If you're caught talking you'll get written up, staff doesn't care about anything and everyone working here are a bunch of a holes. You'll be working eight hour shifts if you're full time with low pay and people monitoring your every move. If you love to be hounded like a dog and ordered around this is the place for you"
bad,"I helped open the store in Fairview Heights, Il, worked in the stockroom unloading trucks and processing the merchandise. I was working full time for them for about 9 months and was in line to be the manager of the stockroom since the manager at the time was leaving soon due to a military move. The stockroom manager and I set up and re-organized the sales floor for them countless times (moving washers, dryers, full size refrigerators, endless amounts and sizes of mattresses, excersize machines, etc. Point being - it was very strenuous work on a daily basis for months). I'm a veteran, as much of the management was too, but apparently that held no ground in their decision making. Once the manager left, they brought over someone from the Sears at the mall nearby and I actually had to train the guy to take the promotion I was in line for. Needless to say, I began job searching the first day he started and left about a month later... Thanks?"
bad,"I worked in the Sears warehouse. I was hired to scan in product delivered by truck each day. Within the first weeks of being there I absorbed another employees job into my own. Now I was also responsible for assessing damage to product and directing it to the appropriate department in the building. No raise was given for the additional work. I did take one vacation and was informed that the warehouse ""fell apart"" without me. After that I became aware of shady activity that resulted in me ending my employment with Sears."
bad,"On a typical day I would first grab a Dollie, unload the delivery vehicles, check the item number, and find the correct location to store the item. usually we would get customer pick ups. The customer pick ups included getting a notification of your sears tool that would notify you overtime someone arrived. You then look at there item number and then search to find the correct item. Sometimes items were stored incorrectly, which made it difficult to properly grab the product in the required time period. We were given a certain amount of time and if we go above, we must give the customer a coupon and the loss time comes out of your pay."
bad,work and work until you can work no more.  I got cussed out by a customer after going the extra to accommodate him.  The manager was right there when it happened and she did nothing to defend me.  The workplace is toxic and I don't trust anyone.
bad,"Work day began at 7am and ended at 7pm. Driving sales and customer interaction was the best part. Having a good team made the difference, as well."
bad,Most people don't care for current people who work there with because of lack of training and professionally I was let go without a reason and it was a hit to the dead and they wouldn't give me one
bad,"I feel lucky having met and worked with my manager.  I learned a lot from him and enjoyed working for him.  "
bad,"They hire individuals under false representations of what the position will be and what will be required of the position.  There are no training processes, yet you are expected to not make mistakes during the learning process.  When mistakes are made, you are mocked in front of peers both orally and written by your managers.  Most, but not all, of the Directors and DVPs do not even know or understand their own business."
bad,"When I had a question and I would ask the manager, all he would say was ""I don't know"" and he wouldn't help us get the resources we needed to answer our question. All they care about is getting protection agreements and leases."
bad,Sears Hometown was a franchised that I had to purchase. When Sears filled for bankruptcy They forced me out of business and did not offer me any type of buy out. I totally lost my investment and my business and my career.
bad,There is very little to say good about SHOS. The chance to make bonus in a small town is little to none. It is a dead end job for most. The manager of my store was outstanding. She was the only saving grace for the place.
bad,I really did not like working here. The manager was very rude. The pay was nice though for a college student. I started at $8.50/hr and i got paid weekly. If the customer service and the treatment of staff was better this would have been a great place to work.
bad,"Working there was alright, but I wasn't able to understand how the company functions until shortly after I left. I was not satisfied with the treatment and lack of respect coming from several managers, nor was I pleased with how a lot of associates would take an extra 30 minutes to an hour lunch. Many times I was left by myself at the registers, which wasn't fully a problem, but since I was experiencing questionable pregnancy complications I have fallen behind with trying to maintain customer satisfaction at a fast and friendly pace."
bad,Unfair pay for the amount of work expected. They can’t seem to hire anyone ever. But when they do they end up leaving quick. This location always has new management. Short staffed constantly or people just no show. Not a job for someone who has bills. Maybe more for students looking for extra cash.
bad,Cleaned more than dealing with customers. Learned more about the manufacturers of appliances. Did not like working for the owners after a few months. Too much discrimination/gender preference.
bad,Not good at all very bad management did not work with you on you work schedule and will not notify you of there are any changes.Also my managment would throw shifts together and not really see if it works for is
bad,My location was a locally owned and operated franchise that was subject to numerous unfortunate circumstances. Unfortunately the business was already in a downward spiral by the time I was hired.
bad,"the staff is amazing and friendly. the costumers are wonderful and the pay is great"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here unless you want to be accused  of anything and everything, they tell you that they believe in giving second chances but when it comes down to it the owner of the store is a hypocrite that only wants what he wants and doesn't care what the cost of it is including his own family..."
bad,"they did not train me, I learned some of skills eventually, but honestly the owners and their kids were stuck up and would not give me the time of day or teach me what i was suppose to be doing. A little here and there, their work ethic was really poor. they sold a lot but I felt like a burden and all I wanted to do was learn."
bad,"Management was good but staff was very rude in the building, Supervisor Was never able to complete paper work that was needed, sgtore never had right equipment that was needed."
bad,"Sears Hometown Store is definitely one of the more stressful jobs I have had. Between the way the store is ran, and the customers it never ends up being an easy/short day."
bad,"at first this job was cool then co-workers and leads start being rude to me , they also told me one pay rate an gave me another and told me there was nothing they can do about it it was a bad experience."
bad,"No typical job at work when management isn't doing their job. There's a quote about a bad manager "" A bad manager can take a good staff and destroy it, causing the best employees to flee and the remainder to lose all motivation."" "
bad,"Appliances are over priced. learned to do a delivery schedule which was exported to XPO logistics. Direct management was fine. Workplace culture was depressed. Pay is not sufficient to satisfy workers. "
bad,First two years of running the store was great. The last three not so great. Sears corp. could not figure out if they wanted to keep us or not. Inventory suffered commissions where lowered district managers help was in short supply. It was around not a good place to be.Im glad Im out lost my investment but life goes on! They did finally sell the Hometown division.
bad,I had the worse experience in a retail company working for them they seem not have people skills at all they only care about numbers.
bad,"Work is always slow. Employees are underpaid. Not really any good benefits available. No future, and no recognition. It barely pays the bills but it works for now. A lot of hours cut due to the slow work flow."
bad,at Sears warehouse it's lack of almost everything communication skills and lack of employees wanting to work at Sears warehouse and it's lazy there even the Leeds
bad,We all know what Sears is up against. There is no real direction at this time. They cut categories with complete disregard to their effect on the remaining categories.
bad,I admit I enjoyed my time working for for sears outlet. I really liked the physical part of it. The only thing I didn't not like was the rate of pay doesn't match the work.
bad,What a great place to learn for a first job. You get the responsibility that will help you in your future career. It is a better position then most people will think.
bad,"I was just a contractor, went in and installed appliance, drop off lawn tractors and created drop offs."
bad,"constantly moving and rearranging product. The harder working you are the more trouble you are in. disregard for osha laws, owner bounced paychecks. claimed they delivered then told the customer it meant to the store not their house"
bad,"I would never work for them again, I worked by tail off to gain a higher position but felt used through inventory and everything once that was over they bring a manager from another Sears instead of offering me the job"
bad,typical day at work is laid back unless we have a truck which is only two days of the week and other than that we just do odd jobs to pass time cleaning putting things together mowing the grass
bad,Not a fun place to work. low pay for the job. Just good if you're looking for something temporary. Bad management in this particular location.They have to do something about their budget.  Hours were cut in. Management does not care about anything that matters. They do a lot of favoritism.
bad,"Would not recommend, commission sales and sub par benefits, "
bad,"constant calls from bill collectors, overflowing dumpster not emptied for months, low pay without benefits, not supplied proper tools to perform duties."
bad,I would not work here. They will not allow you to work full time and after paid training is done you get $4.50 an hour and five percent commission on the master protection agreements (which are not easy to sell). You get one percent commission for the sale you make. They will tell you to keep hounding the customer to buy the agreement and most customers do not appreciate that. I was fired after a month for not meeting the sales quota (even though my manager told me that if you don't meet the set goals for three months straight you'll be fired). My co-worker quit a few days after I was fired because of how underpaid she was (and she worked there months before I got there). I advise you to find a different job to apply to.
bad,COMPANY IS A SINKING SHIP. They tell you one thing and do another. You pour your life into it for a promise that never comes to fruition. Not worth it! Do not start a business with this company unless you have money to throw away.
bad,"Many days are spent taking down 1000 sales signs, and putting up slightly different sales signs, just to take them down again 2 days later. I weep for the trees. Commissions are nonexistent. The pay is laughable for the amount of knowledge required and optimistic sales goals and metrics. There is absolutely no upward mobility."
bad,They are under staffed they do not appreciate their associates and they do not have their best interest at heart and they hire children that are so immature it is like you are in high school all over again
bad,"There were days few customers came through the door and goals that needed to be done were met, but there were days when customers were a challenge to satisfy especially when products you sold them miraculously broke a month after they bought it."
bad,Poor management  don't really know much about the owner but it's a okay company to work for. A five day work week hardly ever any weekend word do all and all its an okay place
bad,I had a purpose outside of what the goal for the company was so I stayed true to that and It was days where I felt really low and more days where I couldn't have been happier. The pay is for someone who has no kids and still lives at home with their parents. Anything is possible with SHO. I highly recommend reading everything they give you. You choose your own destiny. It's up to you to see it as a stepping stone or your final destination. It was free hands-on training for a career I could not attain with them but its okay I am grateful for everything.
bad,"Management has no concern for employees, there are no incentives or room to move up in the company. There is not any appreciation shown for the work done. Coworkers are good, lower management is good. The hardest part of the job is having to cover other peoples shifts when we are short handed and still multitask in other departments. The hours and days off are the best part of the job."
bad,"Keep in mind that as a District Sales Manager, you are the LOWEST level employee at Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores (SHO). Typical day: exactly how many conference calls do you want to have per day? They can start at 6am and you can have 5 or more per day ... sometimes even more. You're expected to be in stores daily (that's normal) coaching, teaching, COLLECTING FROM OWNERS. The relationship between store owners and DSM's has become highly adversarial. SHO's biggest problem is they've eliminated their greatest expenses (lease cost, employee cost, utilities cost) and put them on the backs of their store owners who have been duped into believing they're entrepreneurs. SHO, in the mean time, only has product cost and field management expenses. The Monthly Operating Review is the most stressful event you'll experience -- being asked to explain $4 postage expenses and why a store owner reduced the price on a washing machine by $5 (which you then have to collect from the owner). The P&L is the most convoluted thing you'll ever see - it comes from multiple websites, with multiple inputs from dozens of sources that can charge it without you knowing it yet YOU'RE still responsible. You would think the company would make more money without store expenses. They may end up with the FED Gov't telling them that store owners are actually employees. When that happens, you'll see the place fully crumble."
bad,Company is going threw a lot of changes has a lot to get worked out and not sure if they will overcome the things going wrong with the company. Needs major improvement
bad,Great customers in the town but no career advancement opportunities at such a small store. Some seasons are very fast paced and busy while others are slow and limited for interactions with customers.
bad,"sears hometown stores are individually owned.  this location has changed hands 3 times since i worked there. basically you become a glorified sears employee, even though they call you a store owner."
bad,"as a sales associate, we  would advertise appliances and tools at our store. we stain and polished the appliances we put sale tickets out each day and leased big purchase such as lawnmowers and dryers"
bad,It was a good place to work very good companions who treat me well we did everything very well they have a very good management of the employees and it was very good
bad,"Typical Day of work would start by reviewing previous day's sales, and making sure any delivery/installation for customers for the day are prepared. Working the floor with customers as they come in, help them with product knowledge and measurements. E-mailing new customers with product information to either help close a sale, or inform past customers about up coming sales filled down time. This helped me learn how to advertise myself in a local market. "
bad,There would be times where one or two customer would come in every three hours or so and buy about five dollars of product. There would even be times where we didn't have any customers at all.
bad,"Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores has descended into a very political and toxic environment due to the problems with Sears Holdings, expense in getting data, confusion about technical approaches forward."
bad,I have been working at the Outlet store that was located in Northeast Minneapolis. They laid us off 3 weeks before the Holidays and gave a severance pay that was less than a week of work. They notified us on a Monday that the store was closing and we would be jobless the same Friday (Less than 5 days away)
bad,The job is constantly changing with out notice often increasing the amount of work while cutting down the amount of people to do the job. Work in unsafe conditions and when accidents happen often get swept under the rug and tell everyone to get back to work like nothing happened.
bad,Work extremely long hours with no work/life balance. Poor systems and data integrity. There is a disconnect with upper management and lower management.
bad,"a typical day involved unloading a full semi-truck with 50+ appliances all weighing over 300lbs all by yourself, not including having to price and move the appliances out on the floor ALL BY YOURSELF"
bad,"At first I was very excited to start this job, to gain new experience and to beef up my retail knowledge. My first couple of days consisted of jamming every detail of the stores procedures down my throat and expecting me to memorize everything in one shot. Training at this store was very bland and done in an ineffective way that was almost impossible to pay attention to and retain. By my third day I was cut loose and on my own with very little confidence. Although the stores manager was very professional and knowledgeable, the rest of the crew was unwelcoming and easily agitated when asked for help. Due possibly to my young age I was never respected or taken seriously at this store, especially by the owners. The only person who ever gave me any sliver of motivation at this store was the one and only (and very over-worked) manager. The owners never took more than 10 seconds to introduce themselves or welcome me to the company. Perhaps, because they were too busy staring at us through one of the stores many cameras who will notice even the slightest mishaps. all of this is on top of the stores archaic and hard to understand computer systems, the endless list of prices, forms, codes and steps to each transaction. Overall, I dreaded going into every shift, after feeling uncomfortable all day by the staff and disrespected by the owners I could not stand working here anymore. I have been in retail for 5 years and have held two manager positions, I am a hard worker and can put up with a lot in the work place, but this place was simply not worth my time or effort."
bad,"Good local team, but hands are tied in a floundering company"
bad,"Being brought into a company that needs help with all ends of the spectrum of retail.. If you are gonna have Add-On insurance then you need to compensate the employees. The worst was is never getting paid on time, I loved who I worked with and wouldn’t trade them for anything but this company is going to be like it’s parent company... Bankrupt!"
bad,Everything here is great if you like a relaxed environment but when it comes to management they are unwilling to learn what the other employees know so when it comes to it down the road they can be ready to step in but instead they like to expect them to know it on the spot and if they don't know they tell them to ask someone else. It's good money if you can grit your teeth at the stupidity but if you are easily angered do not work here.
bad,"This corporation is based on having small locations that are franchised. The company owns just a few locations, mostly outlets for damaged merchandise or merchandise that needs cleared out."
bad,"I was an outstanding employee for this company for 2 years solid. Aside from missing some time at work due to emergencies, I was an outstanding employee. Kept up my warehouse, work truck in top notch shape, showroom floor, everything the job called for. Awesome with every customer. Actually, they did follow up calls on my deliveries, and every one was a good or awesome review. I was let go because, "" sometimes you just get bored with things and you have to change them up."" Words from my boss after I left work the previous day, having already discussed it with everyone at work. He had me come in the next morning and already had someone else doing my job. Handed me my last check and told me that.. smh."
bad,"I was hired into my position from the outside and was lead astray about the bonus program. Not even close. Business was going down but cuts were not forthcoming. Even though I was a manger of a department at corporate, I woke one day and was laid off as was my department a month after that. I was transferred to a team during my employment that was neither friendly or helpful to me. They were a click that was lead by their manager as that example. I never belonged nor was I encouraged to belong. I tried from my end but was treated as an outsider. I would say with all that is going on the at Sears and SHOS, it's a bad risk for steady and long term employment."
bad,"Flexible hours.discouraging with impolite or rude customers . The hours are from 20 to 12 mostly . good as a part time /second job only "
bad,It was bad and I hated it it was so bad I almost died and I hated it so mhch I had a bad time all the time and I’m so sad it had to happened to me watch out
bad,"I usually had to help customers in the store and make sells. On delivery days I loaded the truck, and delivered items to the customers homes. I had to clean the store daily. I communicated with customers daily and tried to offer the best deals we could. I learned how to communicate better with people from different backgrounds. I enjoyed making sells and deliveries. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who did not get the type of price they expected and trying to make them happy."
bad,"They are great to work for, so long as over time is not involved. They do not like to pay over time. I worked hundreds of un-paid hours, via DM and RM. Flexible depending on the type of position you are in."
bad,Working at this place was a joke. They pay management nicely. But that’s it. Upper management sucks. And they  don’t train. Don’t even get me started.
bad,"When looking at commision based jobs, always ask for permission to look at how many sales are made monthly. From then, get the experience of other workers and have their opinions validated."
bad,"The culture was to respect everyone's own personal style of selling as a sales associate. "
bad,"It was pretty chill, corporate people are crummy. The employees were chill and you got almost every day off that you requested, for the most part. Pretty lenient manager. Got pizza almost every Friday after a great week of sales, or making the store spotless for crummy corporate people"
good,I wanna tell every one Sears downtown it is not a safe environment okace to be working at very poor customer service and managers working there I am glad I don't work there anymore
good,"Customers are few and far between, and the days get very long. The main focus at this company is selling extended warranties and leasing. Very frustrating when you are not rewarded for selling product"
good,"I was promised many things when I started working for Sears. I was promised reasonable hours and good pay. My pay raise was not processed after 90 days or 180 days, let me clarify that I worked for a franchise store not the corporation. My personal employers were never present. When I was expected to complete a project I was not given the tools that I needed to complete the task at hand. I would not work for a franchise again, but would consider working for the corporation."
good,"It was terrible. poor management, poor scheduling of hours. I was a shift supervisor and management would schedule 1 sales associate in the morning when it was busy, it was busy for us. then scheduled 4 to close out the night. No benefits, and its bought out by Marlu Investment in most cases."
good,I really liked my job until management stared to mess around and not do anything. They would tell Associates they would get a write up if they did not complete all they’re tasks while being understaffed. Management would get annoyed when you would ask for help. They would all be in a group just laughing and talking but ask you how we’re tickets Every 10 mins or when they would be done talking and you had to ask a question
good,It's very laid back working here. The hours and pay is not for someone raising a family. Management takes more vacations than needed. Both managers open and leave at the same time. They are always in the office watching movies. They try to be understanding and can have attitudes.
good,on a day to day basis there is barely anything to do esp during the week. on the weekend there are many more things to do and more customers to interact with.
good,Sears Outlet was a good place to work at. Just needed more hours and a higher pay. I am trying to get back there as a delivery driver soon but I don't have a date.
good,"Failing company, building is filthy and unhygenic. Unable to sell merchandise, so the walls and shelves are stuffed to the point where you can't even take down a product without something falling over or onto the floor. Expected to know how to work the register, but you only get training for cashier duties if you're a cashier specifically. "
good,"To make commission the flow of customers has to be steady, and  business has been slow not enough customer to make sell to. It could better, it seem as if we are going out of business"
good,"Customers were great for the most part but you were only paid minimum wage, a very small commission, and no benefits. Learned a lot about many different products mainly from my own research verses being taught."
good,it was a challenge seeing when I took over the store it was broken in everyway possibale. Just when I got everything back on a positive track and the store was making money sears closed the store
good,terrible hours and the company has no advertising hard to get sales and commission is worthless to even try for dress code is strict and the place is going to go under if certain things do not change to help get customers in the door for sales as well as the pay to deliver anything isnt worth doing
good,"I am a proven retail sales manager with over 10 years of on-hand retail experience within a store management and supervisory position. Successfully achieved strong sales foundation by effectively building and retaining sales team focused around team building and leadership in a customer service environment. Hard working retail management professional versed in all aspects of running a high-end store, including opening and Closing procedures, banking, merchandising and recruiting. "
good,"Worked there to only be owned by some of the cheapest people in the county. Would work you alone from open to close, mention no 30 min lunch in between. The only benefit was to get some commission but other than that I am not sure. It has been sold to someone else since my departure so hopefully it can build its reputation back up."
good,Work was hard work on shipment days. Owner of the store was never around and getting him to help out when he was around was near impossible. Customers were relatively friendly
good,"Working for Sears as an Inside Sales Associate can be quite challenging. On a typical day I would open the store getting all the internal components operational (such as all computers)  including making money drops and counting the days prior sales before even the doors were to be open for sales.  Our main store was listed as Parts for Lawn and Garden however it covered much more than that. We would work directly with the customer to locate through working with the schematics drawings parts that would be required to repair their lawn mower and tractors, show throwers and stove (Electric or Gas), garage components to chains, gear and sprockets sets to openers basically anything that would handle indoor and outdoor appliances.  Stock when needed, performed cycle counts to ensure our inventory was never out of stock.  Internally we had a small staff so we would have to be able to work closely as a team. Hardest part of this job was not locating the parts they needed often our database wouldn't list additional parts so we would have to somehow find that part.  Externally the most enjoyable point of any given day was helping the customer and finding that part or possibly fixing it without having to send it for repair.  This always ensured the customer would come back and indeed they did."
good,Boss has everyones panties waded up into a bunch that everyone there is on edge. Great at pointing out your flaws or failures. but sucks at saying good job. almost have to ask for it.
good,This is not a job for someone who want to bulid a caree. It is a great job for a student or someone looking for part time its not one for someone looking for a career
good,"the one thing that kept me at sears outlet so long was the way the people became like a family, but that can easily be attributed to the people and not the company. "
good,"The location I was working for is no longer open.So, very hard to review. Each of these businesses are independently owned and thusly very difficult to draw a complete conclusion on the company as a whole."
good,"As the headline suggest, every day upper management would constantly bicker and pick fights with lower level managers as well as regular employees. The work day was very tense."
good,Sears has definitely had its ups and downs.  The future of it is questionable and I wouldn't go back at this moment.  There isn't a lot of opportunities.
good,"Fast paced, great people working there. Seem to be making big changes to sustain business. Internal advancement very possible . Expectations are high and pressure to achieve always expected.  "
good,"On a typical day I opened the store making sure all registers were up and running, I learned a lot about sales and leasing they have training every month that you must complete, I was the assistant manager so there were days I had to calm down customers that were upset, The hardest part of my job was the day we had trucks come in because we only had two people in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers I loved my customers it was like family,"
good,"Turned on all computers, downloaded sales from day before, opened store for sales and catalog pick up and orders, cleaned appliances, made coffee, checked orders"
good,"As Sales associate I worked in sales and on commissions. I did well when I was given enough hours to work. "
good,The company sells stores as franchises own your own hardware store. The store I worked at was sold and I became the store manager instead of assistant but the franchisee was unable to make enough money.  The franchisee sold us to another franchisee who apparently didn’t pay there bills so when they wanted out Sears Hometown and Outlet took over and discovered how poorly the company was running the stores they could not afford to keep the stores open. This I blame on the Sears Hometown and Outlet company for not being more involved in the company they franchised the store to make sure they where trying to successfully run the store.
good,"The store has been sold since I worked there.  However, I am sure it is much the same experience - maintenance of the sales floor, dealing with customers, taking out the trash, unloading trucks, etc."
good,"The atmosphere is good. my problem is that my boss doesn't give me enough hours. i was promised a full time job, but instead I'm getting hardly any hours to consider it a legitimate job. But other than that, its an okay job. What my day would consist of, would be taking care of customers, making sure new sales signs are up to date, making sure the new sale signs are printed and ready to be set up, and making sure to keep the products looking nice by dusting and polishing etc. The hardest part would be dealing with angry customers because sometimes they don't like the news you give them if they cant get a part from you or if something is not at the store right then. the most enjoyable part is getting to work with nice customers and making peoples days with a smile."
good,Sears was an OK job. Pretty good hours good commission but management was rude and didn't do what was best for employees I would never work there again.
good,I loved working at Sears untill I realized that that company doesn't really care for it's employees the amount of work expected isn't worth what they pay
good,"No more than 40 hours a week, no overtime, unrealistic expectations, very little of encouragement to meet unrealistic expectations ( beyond not getting lectured about work not finished), almost makes you feel like nothing ever gets done. Items get damaged on route to store, damaged unseen except by customers, more returned products than happy customers. Faulty and failing equipment, and very little work space."
good,"Co-workers are interesting and keep the day going. "
good,"In my format, you're the only manager, so be ready to be there all the time, with not the best/realistic expectations. I'd keep searching."
good,"The average day was pretty busy with a lot of customers and deliveries. The management was decent when the owner wasn't micro managing everything. I got along fine with my co-workers fairly well. I like how many skills I learned, but it wasn't easy."
good,Come in just about everyday and open up the store and set up whats needed to be set up and then learn about either stuff you already know about the product or you're learning something new about it management was good the owners are nice people and work hard to keep it running. the people I worked with were kind and fun to be around. the hardest part was when it was dead and nothing to do.
good,Fast pace company room for improvement team work will help everyone stay on track of the daily opportunities.. bonus structure is nice company are going through changes.
good,"Was off and on days, chasing people left and right to make the money I wanted. People were friendly. Manager a good leader. Store manager wasn’t the right person. Hardly talked too is. Gave everyone a hard time."
good,I loved working here but the pay was very very bad. Made it hard to stay. I eventually had to quit because of it. Loved the job though management and people were great.
good,Something has do be done about there budget. In my one year of work there hours were drastically cut in half twice. Management does not know the word integrity.
good,My overall experience with this company was good except the few issues I had at the particular store I worked at. The store I did my training at was very nice and the staff wanted you to succeed in your job. Shortly after I went to the store I worked at I felt like I wasn't treated like the other workers there. I felt like they were pushing me out the door. Shortly after I was asked to turn in my keys the store I worked at closed. Overall I enjoyed working for the company has a whole. I wish I still worked for the company.
good,"As with every Sales based company, there are ceretain Metrics that have to be met.  It is hard to get a team motivated when the commission rate is so low for the products being sold."
good,"Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores provide good basic jobs, handling and selling scratched and dented, refurbished merchandise at deep discounts.  Unfortunately, the whole Sears Holdings family of companies (Sears, Kmart, Sears Hometown and Outlet) seems to be in trouble, with declining sales and many stores closing."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people there but pay was only minimum wage, no raises and uncertain future with news of what is happening with sears corporate"
good,"Was glad to leave and no wishes to go back, the franchise stores are great but the privately owned stores do not offer any benefits what so ever or bonuses."
good,"While working at Sear I noticed through out the training it you don't get the full effect of the job,not until you are right behind a register trying to tackle a long line. Although the store lines could be intimidating at times there is someone always there to help you and assist if you need it . You quickly get the experience and qualifications for working in retail."
good,This was a competitive business. Management was not up to part. There were no benefits. There were also very few bonuses for the employee to earn. It was an ok experience.
good,"Everyone was fighting for the customers because of the way the sales are. Not busy enough to earn money based on commissions and the cut backs on the commissions. Not one paid holiday, no room for advancement and I never felt appreciated for always going the extra mile for customers."
good,A typical day is doing paper work . Unloading trucks pricing product and doing everyday Management things . I have some good coworkers . The hardest part of my day is dealing with the so called Ast. Manager she doesn't know how to treat people. the most enjoyable time is when I get to go home.
good,"Sell to incoming customers, cultivate relationships with business customers, and maintain inventory.  Receive requests for service and process items once returned to the store for pick up."
good,A typical day starts off with prepping the store to give customers the best experience possible. Making sure prices and merchandise are up and out correctly in order to have efficient sales. Through the company I have learned first impression is one that will last the longest and is the way to win over a customer. Making sure our customers have the best time possible while shopping or just browsing the store is really important because they as well as the community can be the best source of advertisement for a business. My main focus is as well to keep my co-workers focused and ambitious full of drive so that they can succeed in their daily goals and tasks.
good,"A typical day at work would be moving stuff around the store, replacing and putting new prices on items, the rare occasions where a customer comes in to help. Even though my co-workers and I had many complaints on the management and leadership, overall it was an ok experience. learned a good few things while I worked there. There was never really any part of the job that was that hard, mabe just customers that would come in asking to resole issues that dated back years before one was employed there. The most enjoyable part of the job was every time I would easily and smoothly make a sale, and customer walks away happy."
good,"The staff are very understanding and helpful. Very enjoyful place to work. I multitask about 90% of my shift, talk with customers about information in appliances and lawn care products, and clean the store to be presentable for customers."
good,"This location closed. Ownership lacked care of the store or it’s employees, we had to fend for ourselves but still hit our goals. Probably wouldn’t still be there if the store was still open."
good,"I don't have any animosity towards the store, but it cant sustain someone who needs 40 hours a week. Like many small businesses the employment model seems to be only part time, minimum wage for nearly everyone, and no benefits to speak of. Their doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel in terms of upward progression.  The environment is good in that most of my coworkers are eager to train and teach new employees and most of them are not lazy and somewhat care about the mission of the owner."
good,"The timing was awkward-owner transition. However, i felt that the employees were treated fairly and their own hard work paid off with commissions. The harder you work.. the more you make."
good,"Sear's Hometown stores are locally owned.  Responsible for the overall management of the store.  While it was challenging at times, it was a fun environment."
good,Very pushing to up sell protection agreements and credit cards. Even if your store is doing well your associates and management get no raise or bonus. Really good associate discount.
good,Well managed place but the owner is disrespectful. No benefits what so ever. Not even so much as a store discount. Wants employees to work holidays with no extra pay or even a bonus for the hard work you put in.
good,"greeting customers is a day at work standing around sales consultants selling home products. management was terrible, i learned how to come to work for that check &f!!! the gossip."
good,"The store is somewhat lacking in maintenance and the limited selection of items causes dissatisfaction among customers which translates to repeated complaints which must be fielded by the customer service employees. A degree of disorganization is also a contributing factor, but underemployment (limited hours for manager to work with) hardly allows for a complete addressing of the problems facing the story."
good,Great place to find work. Steady pay. No benefits/raise. Would recommend to a friend for a short amount of time. As I said before not a job you can see yourself at forever. At least in my case.
good,"Great group of employees to work with, who would do anything each other. I would show up to work clock in and say hi to everyone and see how the day was going. Check sales/returns, help resolve any customer issues for the day. My main focus is on the customers in the store after that whether they are in Appliances or not  i always help them. Check on product placement during the slow hours as well as my out-of-stock reports."
good,"I've been there a long time. I Gained a lot exeperience in "
good,Started off with a new store and the original workers were great to work with for the most part even management but as time went on and new people came in the environment had gotten more toxic. Training from the beginning was extensive but worthwhile. It had started good but got difficult since.
good,"I enjoyed when it got very busy, made the day go by faster. The better personality you have, the easier it is to form a good relationship with a customer and get a good sale."
good,"I opened the store helped customers with the purchase and order of merchandise.  Loading and unloading of merchandise.  Deposits made, paper work done, reports filed, signs made and posted, inventory checks done and filed, report to the district managers.  Count down register and make sure store is secured lock up and go home."
good,The store announced closing 2 weeks after I started so I  only was able to work there for 11 weeks.  This is a summary of my experience for a very short period of employment.
good,"It was a paying job but not outstanding, Long hours and not much praise for a good job. That being said it was overall a decent place to work but not for a career."
good,"Workplace is balanced both professional and personal."
good,"The store was slow and the manager was not very nice. Overall it was an average job; however, the customers were very nice and always loved getting the assistance they needed."
good,"Sears was a small home town store with a friendly atmosphere, Quick paste and a lot to do. I enjoyed the change from Laborer to retail. I left because the store closed in July of this year."
good,A very easy to learn job that will test your customer service skills daily. The store is usually operated by a small number of employees which allows every employee to receive decent hours and pay.
good,Enjoyable work environment with little to no chance at advancing . Flexible work hours and friendly staff . some management not professional for the work place.
good,"A typical day involves processing merchandise and getting it out on the floor, as well as loading items into people's vehicles and general maintenance and paperwork duties."
good,"I liked working at Sears. They have a hard time keeping a store manager. There is alot of talk behind your back. It would be a great place to work, If different people was in charge"
good,"When you work as an apparel associate, you pretty much walk around the store doing nothing unless a customer shows up. Or the manager will give you a task to do every now and then"
good,Would be a better place to work if there were some kind of benefits. They sometimes overload delivery days to make things chaotic or the customers aren't happy with delivery times that are given them due to lots scheduled.
good,"Retail sales, inventory, unloading trucks and deliveries. This could all be part of a typical day at work. Owner was not the easiest person to work for but overall not bad."
good,"Great training tools and company has selling down to a science,but they need to update the company model and brand recognition has become obsolete compared to the competition.They need to pay the owner/operators a higher commission rate on merchandise sales!"
good,Depending whether or not I open my typical day begins with reviewing on-going promotions.  There is always sale signs to print and place.  Customers to greet and assist in the right choice for their needs and at times offer alternative solutions if we don't carry exactly what they need. This Sears is a Hometown store. It is  owned and run by private owners. Since I have management experience I do understand the business of profit and loss; maintaining low costs and increasing profits. Working as a part time employee and management in this and previous employment; I understand that tactful but firm communication is very important between employees and management.
good,Over all my experience was great with Sears but when I transferred to another location they did not want take my work experience into consideration and advancement was not made possible. Almost 5 yrs with the company and 4 1/2 in management to have a different store ruin my opinion of the company. It forced me to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"The Assistant Store Manager, Hardlines is the chief merchant of the Home Appliance, Home Electronics, Home Improvement and Lawn/Garden/Fitness departments and is primarily accountable for performance with customers, associates, sales and profitability. The Assistant Store Manager, Hardlines is accountable to manage, lead and coach his/her selling organization to maximize our customers’ shopping experience by delivering world class in-stock experience and a well planned and executed MSP. The Assistant Store Manager, Hardlines is also accountable to manage, lead, and coach the consultative selling organization to support the selling process."
good,"Learned more about doing sales. Days are fairly same, helping customers with what they need, running the registers, setting up deliveries, unloading merchandise shipments."
good,"Probably ok for a 2nd income. You should have a spouse that works also."
good,"this company has been fleeting for many years. so there is not sense of security because it could close down at any moment. while i was there, management was laid back and enjoyable to work with"
good,"Not a bad place to work if you're ok with a dead-end job. I didn't hate it, I just hate how things were handled there. I feel like many things could be  a lot smoother if there was a training process and if the parking lot could've been expanded for our truck drivers and their deliveries."
good,I wouldn’t work there again but with the right staff it can be fun and enjoyable. You’ll have to deal with a lot of old people coming in and fixing their problems but besides that i can be pretty manageable and not as stressful if you do well with that stuff.
good,"A well paying job based on work ethic. Unfortunately there is typically no room for advancement. If you're a people person, this is good choice as you build relationships on a daily basis."
good,I worked under a independent owner and he was great. However the lack of communications from corporate and their lack of understanding how it was in a brick and mortar store was surprising over the years.
good,I wasn’t impressed about this job I barely made any money I couldn’t work the floor even tho I did. I was in the back room on the floor doing delivery’s.
good,"My typical day at work is to work to make all my customers happy by providing excellent customer service to every customer. The hardest part of the job is to make a very angry customer happy again with the service of the company. So my duty as a sales lead is to work to ensure that everything is done to ensure that that customer is happy again and build a relationship with them again. The workplace culture tend to be a team based work where the daily goal depend on the team effort each day. The most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing the daily goal. I have learned that every customer's experience affects the reputation of the store and that's why its important to always ensure that customers leave the store happy. eg, if a customer is upset or happy with our services, there is a survey online that customers can express their experiences at the store and that comment can negatively or positively affect the store's reputation."
good,Great for someone who wants beginner experience as a sales person. This position will greatly benefit any individual in their job and positions in the future.
good,"OK place to work too  bad they closed. Liked the variety of areas to make sales, moved around departments and never bored.Always training on new appliances from several manufacturers and craftsman updates on lawn and garden equipment and new tools."
good,"Decent environment and staff. Customers were ok, learned a lot from management. Hours and flexibility were decent. Had fun overall. Would go back and work there again."
good,"easy to get hire and appling is easy just go on line, they set interviews fast, management is friendly and will notify you in no time as to your application status"
good,It was a decent place to work at. Just low pay and no hours. I learned how to deal with customers and sales and also how to install different items at the store.
good,"At sears i did labeling and scanning, accessories,and shipping . Accessories included woman purses, belts, bras and panties.Woman and mans  Hats & Gloves, jewelry, Scarfs and ponchos. Baby clothes and toys. New Born's clothing and other necessities."
good,The job consisted of helping customers find tools and appliances as well as provide information on said appliances for possible purchase. All employees were expected to contribute to the upkeep of the store and the constant monitoring of the expiration of for sale signs on appliances.
good,Very Hard and heavy work at a fast pace. I did like the people I worked with because we all helped each other out whenever it was needed. The team I worked with with were very hard working people and generous with stopping what we were doing and go help someone else out with something that would be too heavy to lift or move on there own.
good,I thought working at sears outlet was an job that was okay for the time being of course. The benefits sounded like they were okay but only if you were the type of person to move up in the management or sales cooperation.
good,"Sears Hometown store is family owned which is a blessing and a curse. It is a tight nit work group which is nice, but the lack of advancement and the pay is lacking. Good hours for someone with a flexible schedule."
good,I do not want to put a review on this page so I am writing this to meet the minimum requirements. Management is fine. Office is fine. Co-workers are good people
good,Good place for a starting job. Part time mostly available. Discount is ok. Offer good deals to customers. Good quality merchandise. Competitive pricing.
good,"I Enjoy the expireinces I have had with Sears.I come from a banking culture and have learned alot through the retail industry. I am however looking to possibly get bank in the banking world,"
good,having to deal with the manager and promises we can not deliver. she would always promises the customer delivery to their homes when we were not allowed to do this. she would also delegate her sales towards me for example she would promise the grill will be built at a certain time which will take away time from my sells to build a grill that i did not get paid extra to build.Unfairly treated by a corporate big shot that was their when the store closed. i asked a simple question and she got mad and decied to fire me on the spot.
good,Ok  to work there long hours sometimes expectations are to high for employees benefits are mediocre very demanding not a lot of training
good,Basic Mall Job. Lots of micro management with a turn key attitude. The work was fine but not challenging. Good job to get you management feet wet. Mall hours. Work alone most shifts.
good,"The job itself is really easy. The workers are also nice and fun to work with. However, all the customers that come in seem to always be in terrible moods. Most of the day the store is pretty empty so it can be kind of boring. Corporate was always changing things which was a bit irritating."
good,This location was a little better because owners lived there and would visit more often so the major things could be dealt with
good,"I was responsible for everything in the store, from employees to merchandise to customer service. Sales and finance was also a big part."
good,It was a good place to work for them but then you are only getting paid for mainly commissions and to get bonuses. I wish they had benefits for PT employees.
good,"Rely heavily on Sears as they go to market. They are trying to be independent, but that is really tough when the sign on your storefront is the same."
good,"Help customers find appliances, Sell appliances and tools, clean showroom floor, and price items. Pretty cut and dry."
good,"Most days began at 7 and ended at 7 or 8 pm. I worked under a franchise owner, so as store manager I ran most day to day operations including ordering inventory, receiving, end of day reports, employee scheduling, employee reviews, hiring, firing, sales training, and much more. Most enjoyable part of the job was training the employees on sales practices, and handling upset customers to resolve their issues. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the Sears Corporate way of doing things. They were not easy to deal with and did not provide much support to the owner, which translated to the sales floor as giving us little power or ability to assist our customers the way we knew they should have been assisted."
good,"The leadership at Sears Hometown Outlet was mixed, sometimes lacked vision in terms of technology and marketing. If you are seeking Tech role, this is not the place for you."
good,Hours changed weekly so you cannot determine how much your gonna make a month. Some weeks possibly less than ten hours which doesn’t result In a very standable paycheck to live on
good,"Everything has a chain of command , with that said everything starts at the top and trickle down if the bosses up top are unsure or uncertain about things it effects the way business is run which effect everyone down under them. All we do is follow directions and implemented"
good,It was a good job very nice customers fun most times very easy but challenging I would say overall a good work experience it has its ups and downs but for a first time job it's ok
good,"I love going into work and doing my job. The only reasons why I am searching elsewhere are the fact that I have plateaued with advancement and am stagnating intellectually. The two owners of the store are some of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met. I leave with a very heavy heart, but it is something I know I have to do in my life. The company as a whole is somewhere else entirely. They seem careless that the Sears name is being dragged through the mud by their parent company. Without any trucks or warehouses of their own, time is running out to react with minimal damage. All attempts to separate even further are only putting burden and stress on the store owners."
good,"unless you work at the busiest store in the state and are a well seasoned salesman do not plan on making livable wages, i did pretty well for myself but the slow months are dreadful ."
good,"Both Sears Hometown Stores and Sears Holdings seem to have very poor and last minute work scheduling structures and little to no benefits offered, including no health insurance, no retirement, no paid time off. Management and coworkers were supportive and congenial."
good,"I enjoy my position and my job here but I am definitely not being paid what I am worth."
good,"Sales floor is extremely fun, but the general base pay per hourly is far lower than what you would expect. Selling Heavy ;awn equipment and appliances mostly"
good,The owner didn't Provide benefits pay wasn't the greatest but the sales side of it with having commission was fun always enjoyed having return customers
good,"Working at a Franchise Store in a small community where Lowes is the most prominent appliance and tools place is difficult, but if you have a good staff and good ownership then it will be a good experience.  Stressful during the holidays but laid back since. Was let go because of change of ownership but the individuals i worked with were great."
good,"interesting to work at"
good,"I worked there for a good amount of time. I went from full time to part time, due to other ventures I wanted to pursue. It’s a decent work environment if you need a job. I would recommend working here if you want to stay busy and have steady income."
good,Store closed after 5 years. Very poor delivery company used. Every week you felt like you were going two steps forward and one back due to the poor delivery service that this company contracted with.
good,I learned a lot working there.  Also was coached into becoming a assistant store manager.  Very flexible schedules with paid holiday and vacation.  Looks for strengths and builds off of that
good,Sears was a great place to learn skills in customer service and to learn to work as a team. Our management and staff were great at welcoming new employees to a supportive work environment. A typical day at work was entering the workplace and knowing you were part of a team that worked hard at whatever task they were given from putting out stock to serving customers. Many of whom were our regulars. Most hardest part of job was getting extra tasks finished when short staffed. Most enjoyable part was knowing you were coming in to work alongside great fellow employees.
good,"Cool work culture, a place to learn and grow. Its great to interact with the customers on a day to day basis. "
good,Its a great place for a new worker or for a part time job. I've worked for the owners for the last  7years. They are good people who are willing to work with you one scheduling.
good,"Sears hometown just a job to get by,you not able to get any raise.The hours are ok but need something better.The environment  and culture is ok they do treat you respect."
good,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,"I was quite happy as an executive manager working for Sears. My co workers were very productive hard workers and out sales revenue margins proved it. The workplace environment was quite relaxed and I enjoyed the freedom of not feeling enslaved to a corporate giant. Additionally, the bonus's and perks along with travel was great."
good,Sears is a good place to work if you are starting out or you don't need a lot of money.  The staff where I worked were friendly and helpful.  It had a relaxed atmosphere (work at your own place - on most days) that was enjoy to be in.
good,"People are great I love them they treat ya like family, but the pay isnt great at all and benefits could be a little better. Fun enviroment to be in and security needs to be upped more. Alot of theives."
good,Days where long with never to much to do. Co-workers and I had several communication problems. Work was never stressful and always relaxing
good,"Customers are a pain to work with. management was picky. Did learn a lot about appliances and other tools, and electronics."
good,I love my job I have been here for 18 years just don't pay enough love working with the techs I have here. Just need another income at night will not leave my day job. Love my boss I work good with other and I was try to my a better placed for myself and others.
good,"I had a wonderful time, learning a new skill: retail.  In doing inventory, stocking, unloading trucks, ordering merchandize, etc. It has been an eye opening experience. I opened/closed the store listened to customers problems and we worked thru several."
good,"Laid Back, commission on sale's, nice people to work for, pulled out mowers for display, I liked being busy, not very much to do. warehouse not organized,"
good,I enjoyed working with the public and my regular customers. You definitely had alot of information to know in order to do your job effectively. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,was a good job and close to home i worked with good people had adequate training my last manager was he best work schedule was great tools and equipment was excellant i advanced quickly my skills were reconized
good,"Note: This is an uninsulated warehouse and is extremely cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer."
good,"I didn't work there very long, but for someone trying to make a living if you loose your commission cause you didn't meet a percentage sucks. I did make sales and you took them from me so I lost money to live on."
good,"Awesome place to learn management skills , merchandising , customer service skills and the overall how operations work in the retail industry , leadership skill, included ."
good,I enjoyed working here but the advancement is little to none. It is a great place for someone who wants to get work experience and is content with the same thing every day.
good,"This was a Part-Time Assistant Store Management position.  I enjoyed sales and working with people. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was researching for special orders. The management was very good to work with but they were the franchise owners and there were no chances for advancement, full time work or benefits."
good,Great place to work but store closed down. If you are willing to be pushy and don't take no for answer you will do well. Manager was very nice most of time there was not time for breaks
good,"Most days are overwhelming and stressful. "
good,"Working as cashier making sure that you have everything you need to finish the sale for the customer."
good,"good company, could be less stressful daily. a lot of metrics to make and achieve. more marketing to ensure customer footstep would be nice to ensure metrics can be made"
good,Can be stressful at times but also rewarding if you truly apply yourself and your learned skills. I liked my store and my managers and my customers too.
good,I was privileged enough to work with some amazing people however there was no room for growth in the company for me. I left to finish my bachelor's degree. It was a great place to learn personal skills and to work part time while attending school.
good,This is a great environment workplace. the people I worked with were great. the type of work was easy and I learned a lot about sppliances. The manager was great and helpful.
good,"I started my day clocking in and walking the floor for items that needed to be pulled of the floor. After that I would sweep and mop the floors. Then I would make sure the restrooms were clean and stocked with the essential materials. Then i would continue to put deliveries in the dock that were to be picked up that day or the next possible date. I would also check for nationals that needed to be cornered wrapped and strapped to a pallet properly. I would then go on to unloading the trucks that arrived with new merchandise and assist in pricing the products. After that i would make room on the floor for new products and would fill the gaps with the appropriate appliances. Additionally i would makes sure the appliances were organized and aligned. through out the day i keep the product stocked for display. through out the day i would continue to stock and pull appliances. at the end of my shift i would make sure the store is clean and presentable and all my duties done."
good,Fun to work at. Hours fluctuate more than I'd like. Had to fight and beg just to get a 0.25 raise. Otherwise it was a job that i enjoyed.
good,"Owned and operated day to day operations that included: sales, service, delivery, planograms, customer service, payroll,"
good,"Sears Hometown is a good place to work, however, there's not a lot of money in it. It is, for the most part, a retirement job for those whom don't need to make much income. Very relaxed place to work."
good,"Typical workday consisted of moving small to large boxes, opening up and assembling appliances, tools, and equipment, assisting customers, stocking the shelves, and organizing the back warehouse."
good,Good place to work. They let you work on your own with initial guided direction. Would recommend to anyone. The business concept is somewhat unique so that makes it fun.
good,"Sears Hometown Store is a franchise with a great working environment.  The owner has high standards for quality assurance of merchandise, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction.   Customers were frequent buyers, living in the area; staff developed friendly work relationships with customers."
good,"My manager (also the owners) were very friendly and understanding. If there was any time an emergency came up, I could call and inform them without them holding it against me. They make you feel welcomed, and are very easy to talk to. I learned a lot while working here. I learned about refrigerators, washers and dryers, stoves, lawn mowers, tools, and tons more. The hardest part of the job, for me, was trying to sale mattresses. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like everyone that worked there was more of a family than a job with strangers."
good,"The Place I worked was a decent place to work until it closed down.  The location was not very good, and it was not a good location to have a business."
good,This is a great company to really own your experience and learn a tremendous amount. This is great for self starters.  It is not for those who are not OK with a trial-by-fire environment.
good,"I loved working for Sears Outlet, great staff, I loved my manager. Very competitive environment, need to be a fast learner, lot of information to learn in a short period of time. Have to be a self starter and have alot of self discipline."
good,Sears business is declining and will soon close its doors. As a cleaner I am required to clean 4 used or new appliances per hour. in an 8 hour day that amounts to 32 appliances. This is a challenge but can also be rewarding in a job well done.
good,Working at Sear Outlet you learned to sell many different products. The hardest part of the job was being short staff so the work life balance was sometimes hindered. The upper management staff was great always willing to train.  Benefits and wages were very competitive.
good,Very good company to work for.  I really enjoyed working there and the training as well.  They are a fun family oriented company to work for as well too.
good,"Same as any other Sears hometown store. Usually pretty quiet, rarely got busy. Its permanently closed now as a small Sears store doesnt usually work next to a Tractor Supply"
good,"From the management to my workers, they are great people to work with,  who are always there to help and support each other. A pleasant work environment is one of the  most enjoyable part of coming to work."
good,"I learned alot of various skills at this job and can be very fast paced at peak seasons, The hardest part of the job can be lifting and moving appliances that can at times range up to over 200 lbs"
good,"I loved my customers, they would always come to visit me while I was working, or if I wasn't there they would only come back when I was there.  Being the only one working in the store at some points was hard when there would be a rush or you had to use the restroom."
good,"fun, fast paced, great people. Product and overall store knowledge is critical. Follow up calls and emails a must. Good luck!"
good,If you are thinking about working for sears and you are lazy don't do it.The work is usually not easy and the pay isn't great if you work hard you'll be able to make a living though.
good,"just like walmart, you have bad p[laces to work and you have good places to work. they are all the same but the boss and coworkers is what makes the difference. in this case, the boss is a easy gon g guy and it is a very good job, it is a dealer store so the boss is personally paying you, meaning he cant pay more than 8 bucks and hour at the most and you dont get sears discounts like corperate store give."
good,The Sears Hometown Store was a great place to work.  The owners actually took the time to care about their employees.  A typical day involved taking care of customer needs and helping them find the product they were looking for.
good,This is a great first retail job give you experience and let you learn the ins and outs of the company. You always stay productive.
good,"I would review orders maintain work place, offload trucks on truck days deliver meet and greet customers. Management was always alert and giving orders that had to be completed. Co-workers always showed up ready for work. the hardest part was probably off loading the truck depending on how big the load was, and we take care of that first thing in the morning the rest was a piece of cake... What I liked most about a typical day at work was leaving the customers satisfied and smiling."
good,"Typical day includes open/closing store, counting registers, banking, and educating customers on appliance to best advocate a product."
good,typical small town sears store not very big often very slow but still productive management could use some help
good,The Customers are great when they get to know you. When you get to get to know the customers they always come back. Its a laid  back company and they are laid back people. Christian believers which makes the work place more acceptable!
good,"As an owner of a successful retail establishment, I gained skills that are invaluable to customer service, problem solving, retail management, and sales.  I managed up to 10 employees at times including some independent contractors.  I performed many duties including payroll, scheduling, report building, and sales training. Along with this I worked on the sales floor extensively providing exceptional customer service while selling product."
good,"Owner are very nice people, and left managing the store up to me with very little supervision."
good,Mine was typically pretty quiet and customers were generally really nice and cooperative . The management was nice but expected you to finish and really long course that took me and my manager about a month to partially complete after getting the job. Would recommend for how laid back it can be with demeanor but that can change if there is a rush of any kind
good,"A typical day work consisted of customer service, talking to coworkers, and sitting majority of the day. What I have learned is that I actually enjoy interacting with the customers. Management was great! Loved working for two store managers...best guys I've ever worked for. Workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was signing the tools. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers and interacting with customers."
good,"Sears was an excellent company to work for, i learned alot about applainces we used in our everyday life, i still today know alot of about products and help friends make the best decesions before spending money."
good,There are many opportunities and programs to learn including sales applications and continuing education credits.  Many sales meetings and team meetings
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the sales associates and the most of the customers.Retail is changing so fast and we need the right people to lead us to success! Would like to see more of the upper management and District Managers with more retail experience.
good,"No paid vacation, no sick days, no uniforms (unless you pay for them). Plus, is I am able to bring my son to work. Owner is a great friend. His family treats us like family."
good,"I loved the job traveling out of anchorage to different places, got a lot of exercise delivering appliances, just realty long hours,  affecting my relationship with other people,"
good,"Coherent learning experience to acquaint sales culture and develop into the habits of qualifying, negotiating, resolving customer needs. Due to hardships financially, the employment along with other colleagues was abrupt."
good,Sears was a nice part time job in the evening  around school . Sears  was fun because I love the job I was doing Data Entry.  The people I worked with was alright and  friendly .
good,I would not consider this as a full time career choice. But for a student trying to learn good customer service and how to work in a simi fast paced invironment it's great.
good,"fun work environment with a lot of on the job training. Must be able to converse with customers, and determine best products for customers. Must learn about all products carried my your store."
good,"I enjoyed assisting customers on a daily basis.  Loaded and unloaded merchandise in various outdoor elements.  On may given days, I was called into work on days off and hours before my shift was scheduled and there was opportunity for overtime."
good,"I learned a great deal about the retail world. If you did not know about the products you are selling, the customer would know it and go somewhere else. The best part of the job was sharing my knowledge of the products with the customer, so they could make the best choice for themselves."
good,"I have lots of fun working for sears hometown stores as a salesman. I even took up part time delivery / installer position. I really enjoy my job. People at my store are very friendly and the environment is family like. I get to be independent and I really enjoy working with customers finding appliances for them. Nobody works on commission which I'm ok with but there is absolutely no incentive. No bonuses, no benefits, no vacation, no pto, no discounts and there is very limited opportunity for raises. That is a local management issue. The corporation on the other hand does not set very many expectations for its stores and has its head in the sand most of the time. We deal with supply issues that never get solved and the warehouse damages half the product that comes in. No corporate intervention. The corporate marketing guys wont make any effort to help the Sears name look good or just change our name so we get more customers."
good,"Moderate pace with a fairly relaxed environment, pleasant co-workers, overtime is not required but the opportunity on occasion when there is additional that can or needs to be done."
good,Great owners but the corporation has some major flaws in development and improving employee goals and careers. Good pay and strong management. Great delivery team and co workers.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the job. You work already joyfull people, the customer was not as bad as other places.The coworkers were great. Sear outlet wasa great place to work at."
good,Hurricane harvey hit and half the staff was fired....... I loved my job helping people building trust and a sense of understanding what the cuatomer was after.
good,"It's a good job,but I need more hours,hours are being cut to make up for more help,love working with people and I'm great at sales  met my quote Almost  every"
good,"I loved working for sears, management was always there to help with any questions. Overall I would recommend sears to anyone looking to gain career experience."
good,ive worked for sears outlet for 2 years and the time i was there was very productive ive learned alot about the company and what they look for into making it a bigger bussiness.
good,"Great place to work if you are just starting out, wouldn't make it a life time job commitment. There isn't room for advancements."
good,Friendly workplace. Learned proper customer service and how to operate cash register. Also learned the pros and cons of certain brand names in the appliance business.
good,"It was a good company to work for. Benefits were good, I loved working with the public. Gained valuable insight and information to apply in other areas of life."
good,Good job for students who need a flexible schedule. A typical day consist of knowing your daily sales goal and going out to start selling to every customer coming in through the door.
good,"Owning a Sears Dealer Store is rewarding most of the time. Sears carries the inventory so the initial investment is mainly for fixtures and computer set up. Not cheap, but manageable."
good,"I worked at another Sears Hometown and we had gotten a percentage off of any product while employed. This store paid the same rate but has no benefits. "
good,"This job was great for social purposes.  Friendly customers that I helped make the best decision to fit their needs, trusted my honest opinion and knowledge on selecting the suitable appliances."
good,"Sears Hometown is customer oriented which is geared to offer the customer best decision for whatever the product they are seeking."
good,Owned and  operated Sears Hometown in Lake Geneva one of companies top producing stores Sold building and Sold building thought I wanted to retire changed my mind like working
good,"One you get a team memeber trained the flow of working together was great, and when you were short staff if was sometimes stressful to get through the day. We always came together in providing care to all customer. As long as I showed and explained to other what to do when we got busy then it went by smoothly."
good,Won Employee  Of The Month 3 Times. Was Good At Keeping The Receiving Area In Good Order. Was Good  At Unloading Trucks In Good  Time. Was Also Prompt And Efficient.
good,"It's a nice place to work, friendly employees and the old management was amazing, the assistant manager was wonderful he took time to train all of his employees and help any customer that needed help."
good,"It was a great place to learn.  There are a lot of talented, team oriented people who work there.  The management team is supportive.  The benefits were good.  The owners are great."
good,"Working at SHO was easy, laid back and enjoyable. My co workers were easy to get along with. The initial management was fine, they were owner operators"
good,"Sears Hometown & Outlet is a separate company from Sears Holdings Corp.  The stores are independently owned and operated by independent owners.  "
good,Sad to see the store close. I enjoyed the other employees and meeting the folks in the area. Great place to work part time for a retired woman like me.
good,The store had a great group of people working at it. The hardest part of the job was putting all of stock away quickly. I learned how to work with difficult customers.
good,"i loved working for this call center meet lots of people my co workers were awesome and very helpful. Managers were cool for the most part, it was very busy worked on constant automatic dialer, loved helping out the customers made my days go by real fast."
good,Great group of people in management. They always had your back and would answer all your questions about tasks. They would always come running when things got crazy busy and help you tell sanity came back or slowed down. Would compliment you on things you did well. They would just suggest you try it this way next time if you did something wrong. Really great people who wanted you to become successful at your job.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Sears in Walla Walla. The owner Scott is a great guy. They worked with me quite well in regard to desired hours, leaving if I needed to etc. There is a commission on sales but it was hard for me to make much off of it. But that was just me. Our top sellers made a good amount of compensation. You get to work with tools sometimes, operate tools, mowers and other equipment. You'll be given a variety of things to do so it doesn't get too boring."
good,Worked for this company for many years. The knowledge you acquire about consumer products is  2nd to none. Started off working in the warehouse unloading shipments. We received 2 to 3 shipments weekly. This includes customer and store product. Check through the product items to verify all product was shipped . Proceed to put product out on display and stock shelves. Through proper training you learn about product and get the proper knowledge needed to get into sales. Engaging with customers is the most rewarding part of the job. Learning what they're needs are and recommending the product that will benefit them the most. It's all about the customer.
good,"Relatively easy job, sucks that you dont have much control over the delivery system, customers are the absolute worst when something goes wrong that is out of your control"
good,"The people were nice, the job was fun, and the work was easy.  The boss was my neighbor and is a great dude. I don't know much about the company because I was young at the time and was focused on my store only."
good,"Good local hometown sears store, with great staff. I learned a lot about ranges, washers, dryers, and lawn mowers/tractors in the few months that I worked here before starting my career."
good,"Flexible with hours. Best to work busy days (weekends).  Nice managers, a lot to learn about products. The more you learn, the more you make. Good discounts on merchandise."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with. Awesome working environment and place to grow. Fantastic place to learn about retail and grow as a teammate.
good,Always something to do friend co workers very laid back can be busy some times if you get your work done management was happy good discount o. Merchandise and pay is ok
good,"There is a lot of repetitive customer base within the appliance department. Therefore, client retention is very attainable. Maximize on the education available and retain your customer base and the pay can be rewarding."
good,"I really liked my Position with Sears."
good,Able to work with minimum supervision.Order the parts that will be needed for the repairs. Maintain the inventory of service and parts in optimal conditions.
good,Sticking shelves.  Unloading trucks sorting items unpacking boxes. Removing trash cleaning up the area this was a daily routine. Also making sure other areas were clean other than my own throughout the floor.
good,Very fun and understanding environment. I had many moments with my auto immune issue and they were willing to work around it. I had a blast working with my past fellow coworkers and it was an amazing place to work.
good,"Sears Outlet is a company that expects a lot from its associates. After clocking in each morning, I proceed to work on weekly inventory for the company. I am also responsible for dividing store pallets. Through this job I have learned just how important it is to provide accurate inventory for a company, refined my leadership skills as an assistant manager, and learned to remain consistent at the workplace, since my expectations with inventory management remain high constantly. "
good,Sears Hometown Stores are a great place to work especially if you need a flexible schedule. The pay for store associates ranges from hourly to hourly plus commission depending on what you job title is.
good,"Engineered a successful turn around from a store closing in six months in 2013 and worked hard to build customer service and sales and marketing team at this store.  Remodeled and uplifted the store, cleaned up the existing computer and networking systems, empowered employees on decision making, team work, improved employee recognition process and training process. Completed advanced product displays."
good,"Worked for Sears for 11 years, I would probably still be there but I felt that the salary did not fit the job. I did enjoy the job and the people I worked with. It was challenging and educational. I probably did more than my job required but that's just me I like to be busy."
good,Good company to work for.  Unfortunately the CEO made some bad decisions and caused the closure of the store.  Good people to work with.  Excellent store manager.
good,I worked here in college. It was a great place to work as a student because the owner was very flexible and would work around your schedule. Be nice to the customers and they will return the favor
good,Typically showed up to unload the merchandise truck and take inventory and stock shelves. Then proceeded to help customers as a sales associate on the floor. Performed tasks such as running the register and helping customers find products.
good,I love the workplace its alot of fun meeting new people. Me basically running the store and training my own boss isn't to hard but at least he respects me for my knowledge of the store
good,"I love how everyday someone would come in to pick up a package, Sears or Purolator, and they would be so happy to get it. They would show us and walk out all happy!"
good,"Customer service is # 1 when at work I would drop whatever I was doing to help customer, peolple I worked with are cheerfull most of the time, when I had time I would teach about plumbing.Best part of job I was trusted enough to be on my own."
good,"Good atmosphere, with usually a small work team. "
good,"The working environment was fun and engaging with plenty of online training courses and resources to expand product and branding knowledge. District managers were easily accessible and often present in stores to answer questions and guide employees in how to approach customers. Franchise owners had a little more leeway in store operations than is generally acceptable and this could have a bearing on the customer experience, but overall it was a very good company to work for."
good,"Working at Sears Holdings Co. was pretty fair. I wasn't the best but it was alright. The hours where very good, but the pay was a little short. It all depended on the position you had. If you weren't hourly, you really wasn't making any money."
good,"Customer service. Stocked, cashiered and shipping.ladies department, kids department, mens, shoes I worked everywhere other than tools and appliances."
good,"I've worked at Sears for about 8 years, and it certainly was a learning experience. This was my second job in retail, but i learned far more things than just being a cashier and stock boy.That particular sears was originally a sears hardware store, and i gained knowledge about painting, plumbing, tools, lawn and garden etc. And when the store changed into a sears outlet i learned about all things pertaining to appliance and furniture.It was also my first time as a manager(Receiving) and that was a quite the experience. Putting that aside it was mostly an easy going job- the hardest part of it was dealing with customers. But as long as you did your job to the best of your ability, managers did notice and tried to get you a raise. Overall, i would probably recommend this job for young people just getting into the workforce and need some experience to put on you resume. Anybody else(seasoned workers), i would recommend they go straight to management positions if they intend to stay with the company for a few years."
good,"SHO was a greenfield project. The project gave a good learning experience. We were about 20-25 in the project team."
good,Sears was a seasonal job that was part time. They didn’t give much hours. The pay was minimum wage. The experience was one to learn and pretty easy to learn
good,Helped get the franchise store back on its feet after it was left with no owner. Overall it was great learning experience and taught me a lot of what i know today in the retail world.
good,"working at sears i would unload trucks,stock floor,make sales,set up deliverys and even deliver. i also handled our daily paperwork and deposits. i would also do weekly schedules and be available at anytime if someone couldnt make it to work their schedule day."
good,Come into work  get the work orders then I call The customers that go I go to their house look at their small engine equipment figure out what it need to be fixed. Order there parts then schedule a time to come back and repair the best part I like about this job is when I know the   Customer is happy the hardest part of the job is repairing things on the ground
good,"Was one of my best dockworker experience did enjoy it and love it, learn I lot and will like it to continue a job like sears warehouse. Can't complain nice manAgers"
good,"This is a great place to work if you love business and retail, and love to meet people. A typical day of work involves opening the store and assisting customers throughout the day, while cleaning, taking inventory, and pricetagging when thigns are slow. Workplace culture was generally good, with emplyees often joking together and working well on tasks they divided amongst themselves. Management was nice, I took any issues straight to my supervisor and he dealt with them quickly and well, or pointed me in the direction of someone who could do so. The hardest part of the job for me was staying focused throughout the day when things were moving slowly, because I like to keep busy and interact. The most enjoyable part was probably talking with and finding out more about the people who came into the store. I love connecting with new people and learning about the world. I certainly learned patience and how to work under pressure, but also how to take a breathe, relax, and have fun!"
good,Customer Service is the best part of the job. You learn to resolve customer issues quickly and maintain a pleasant interaction. Work life balance is good.
good,"Usually sell lots of vacuum bags then there's the occasional appliance or tractor customer.  Some down time but then there is stocking, cleaning and rearranging to do to keep busy."
good,"Learned about appliances "
good,its a good place to work for 11 an hour with guaranteed over time i was sometimes working as much as 60 plus hours a week its very heavy lifting and a lot of hard work and your exhausted by the end of the day but if you really want a lot of work for good hourly pay this isn't  a bad industry.
good,This job has been a great opportunity to use wonderful customer service daily. Learning to build trust and lead a team to maximize proficiency is practised everyday.
good,I really enjoyed the quick advancement and all that I learned while I was a member of this store.
good,Say YES! Always there for the customer making sure they are satisfied.
good,"It is a fun working environment. Since our store owner is not really involved in the store it's up to me to keep up everything in check. I have to run 6 different commercial accounts as well as process all of the payroll, banking, and general up keep of the store. I have to basically do two full time jobs. The first being our commercial accounts. Our biggest account ""...."" builds around 10 houses a month and they do all of their appliances through us. I have to set the pricing on each house and make sure that I follow through with that I have made an excel document to fully show that. Also if their was any problems with the deliveries, I am the contact so I have to solve any of the delivery issues. If their was any problems after the house has been closed on like the fridge stopped working, i also am contacted to make sure a technician gets to the house in an orderly and realistic time frame. I spend roughly 3 hours a day doing quotes and taking care of any issues. We have around 5 other commercial accounts that probably build or need appliances twice a month and all the same things I have to do in our ""...."" account i deal with them. I spend roughly an hour dealing with that. I'm also the store manager so i have to deal with any complaints that customers have, keeping the stock on the floor maintained, do all of the payroll, banking, hiring, firing, paying the bills, and employee schedule making. I do 90% of the work involved in the store. I have 4 other employees who work under me, and three of whom have only worked in the store around 2 months. The other guy has been with"
good,"Being your own boss is great. I have learned so much about myself not only as a worker and a manager, but more importantly, as a leader. I have developed excellent customer service skills, living out our company's motto ""Ultimate Customer Service Is Our Standard."" I have learned how to manage and lead employees who are double my age and deal with adversity in the work environment. I can honestly say that the most enjoyable part of my job is when I preemptively enable a creative solution to avoid a situation leading to a potentially unhappy customer. Adversely, the most difficult part of my job is discovering that sometimes it's impossible to avoid having an unhappy customer. I moved over a thousand miles for this job, planning my future on retiring as owner of multiple Sears Hometown Stores; but unfortunately, the job security and future isn't as bright as initially thought. "
good,"Sears taught me to be a strong leader and a team player.  Not only was I accountable for sales, profit and loss, but I learned the operations side as well.  My experience with Sears was a good one and I enjoyed my time with the company."

good,"For Sears, I helped unload the trucks, stock the inventory, and worked retail. I also worked the phones to assist customer service. I also helped make deliveries."
good,My days start with opening the doors meeting and selling to some of the most loyal customers in our market place. The owner is very nice to work with and we have a very good managable staff. The hardest part is dealing with a rude unhappy customer that seems sometime to never have the correct ansewer for them. The most enjoyable is making  suggestion to a customer and they actually take your advice and they are very satisfied at the end result.
good,"Strong Leadership in the organization. Difficult at times for traveling positions. "
good,"A typical day for me is to review current sales promotions, follow up on sales leads, assist customers and answer any questions they may have. I was working full time at this company and now only work weekends.Management is available and trains each employee in regards to product information and sales tools. Co-workers are helpful   and friendly. The hardest part of my job is during slow times throughout the year, I like to stay busy and be productive each day. Unfortunately, this position does not present an opportunity for advancement and benefits are not available. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help customers find appliance/merchandise that they are happy with. I also love to help customers find good deals on items, this company is based in my hometown and I take pride in helping members of the community when possible."
good,"Sears is a good place to work if you do not mind not getting paid overtime for working 60 hours a week. Is laid back, fun place to work with good people."

good,This was a good job. The store manager did not want to deal with theangry customers  and left the store unattended  almost on a daily basis. The employees were  supposed to get our commission  but never received it.
good,"I liked working there but didn't get paid much and it was really slow so it made it hard to earn from it,. they are also privately owned so the owner sets their pay and benefits so they would all be a little different depending on the owner."
good,"Good Company to work for, support readily available.  Manual provided for quick reference.  District Sales Managers work very hard to support owners while following company policies."
good,"It started off being a fun place to work. We did everything but everyone helped each other out with whatever new task was requied."
good,While working there it was very nice to be apartof the company only down fall was the owner didnt pay us on time.but all in all the company was great no lay offs or firing

good,"Typical day at work, fast paced with little down time. The customers are great and the associates are great people to work with.  Good managers in all"
good,Sears is going under. Otherwise id still be there. Management was very good. They were encouraging in doing a good job. The best part of the job was the people. The worst part was not having enough supplies to get the job done. I learned to come up with new ways to get the job done quickly and with excellence.
good,great place to work for the people there are nice had a blast. wish I could stay but needed more hours management was great had a blast there hope they all do good there
good,My Goal is to meet the need of the client and assure that all needs have been met. The fulfillment of meeting the clients needs is whats drive to stay in sales.

good,"Everyday is a fun day at Sears.  I always get to deal with the most amazing customers at the Red Bluff store.  It is a fast paced and exciting job.  I have learned more about the mechanics of our Lawn and Garden equipment, but also how to deal with a different customer  related environment.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with my co-workers and the owner of the store because none of them work without complaining about it.  The most enjoyable part of the day fo rmyself is when i get to go to lunch or go home."
good,"Working for Sears hometown stores has been one of the best jobs I have ever had. Having never worked in sales prior to this job the work has been way different from what I am used to. The only thing that kinda stinks about working for Sears is there is are no benefits and pay is very low. Each store is an individual franchise so its up to the owner to be good to the employees. In my experience there are zero benefits, no commission or bonuses, no raises and no paid vacation. Paid time off is also discouraged."
good,I recommend working for Sears any day the employees are very respectful all the time. Things maybe a little pricey but its affordable. The make payments with you.
good,"I was not able to work there very long since we ended up having to move due to my husband's job, but I was in training to become the assistant manager."

good,Not much room to advance but great company and employees. Very personal and laid back sales enviromment. No need to pressure the customer like the corporate stores
good,This was not a corporate store. It was commission and lots of fun.
good,"Good people, poor pay for the amount of work there, really physical since you have to unload and load trucks by hand using dollys a lot of heavy fridges."
good,Come in every morning with a list to do. Get your list done for that day then you go through make sure everything is clean and all your tags are up to date.
good,I loved working with my boss and manager. They helped me learn the ins and outs. It really was a great place. I wish I still worked there. I miss it..
good,"I Had A lot of Fun At Sears and My Coworkers Were Nice, Friendly, and Patient With Me The  Whole Time I Worked There. I Had My Troubles But They Were Quick To Help Me Fix Them."
good,"Flexible work schedule"
good,"Well When I Worked There, It Was Fun Like All The Time, You Would Hardly Even Notice You Were Working, My Co-Workers Knew Exactly What They Were Doing, And How They're Handling Things, Especially They Answer My Questions When I Would Get Lost, I Think I Made Great Effort In Myself, As A Person, More Talkative Skills, And I Feel Like I Can Be More Open With Myself, And People, I Would Like To Work Where I Can Help People At A Slow Paste, Fast Food Restaurants Were Nice When I Was 16 But Now I Want A Steady Good Job."

good,"Good starter job, locally owned and operated. Several Areas to learn more product knowledge. Just no room for growth as the owners run their stores. "
good,Great company to work for management is cool good place to start a career to become successful. Pay is great the overtime is not mandatory but it pays to be available.
good,"Clock in, proceed to register, clean, wait for customers, try to sell lawn and push mowers, appliances, matresses, etc. fold clothes, change signs, etc. I learned to build tool boxes, mowers, learned about tools, etc. Management was great, very friendly."
good,"key holder would open store unlock doors, count drawers start registers. check emails, fusion orders, sales, customer service. I would stock the floor and do inventory"

good,"I have been working at this store since before it opened on October 2015. After weeding out some dreadful employees, this became a great place to work. I used to work at a Full-line store and I was so miserable, I quite. We have people leave around December and January, leaving me as the only employee.My owner (who lives 3.5 hours away) has made sure I get time off by either coming to the store or send people from one of his other stores. I have zero complaints about the store, nor the owner, and I love working here."
good,"A typical work day there now is very slow because its not the holidays anymore. I learned that when its at a fast paced that it be really packed in the store. The management team is very cool and nice and their very helpful. The hardest part about working there is when its a long line and I'm the only one that's at the register. The most enjoyable part about the job is that its actually very relaxing, and its fun to be around cool people and things."
good,"Love the culture of being in a community based place and servicing the needs of our local families!  Relaxed, fun, friendly. Hours for retail are reasonable."
good,Wonderful place to work with great peers. Enjoyed the work tremendously and would have loved to have stayed. Sears was not able to stay local so my time there was shortened.
good,"Every day was a new adventure, I never knew what would come next, as diversified as you can get, the opportunities were amazing IF you can do this place long term."
good,"I loved working for the Sears Hometown Co. I learned so much about the products we offered to best suit the needs of our customers. We had a great staff in place which made the work day run smoothly. Hardest part of the day was realizing it was quitting time because their was always so much to be done. Most enjoyable part of the day was closing down & staying an extra hour after to finish my work uninterupted, example: sales takedown, company paperwork, banking, & end of day proceedures."
good,Excellent Christian environment. Flexible hours. Low weekly hours. Co-workers are excellent. Low impact work. Low traffic.
good,Working with some great people. Been in retail for a long time. Enjoy the interaction with people. I understand this has to be a certain length but not a really good idea to make this obligatory
good,I would recommend to anyone who wants hard work working experience to start there either part time or even full time. It will be hard work but it's not miserable in the slightest from the driver helping you to the bright warm smiles and interactions you'll get from the customers. So if someone 16 to 18 wanted a good paying hard working staring job to gain some work experience of tell them to start there.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job there.  the owner was awesome.  It felt like I was working with family.  The paperwork was easy.  The registers were a little complicated but it didnt take long to catch on with proper training.

good,"Receiving inventory or product, customer service. The management was terrific. Standard retail environment. Dress pants and collared shirts were mandatory."

good,I enjoy the people I work with and management. I appreciate the opportunity to be my own person. I perform my job with very little micromanaging which I enjoy. I appreciate being able to make decisions on my own. I feel like I am running my own business with the authority given to perform my duties as needed for the business.

good,"As most retail jobs this is a fast paced and competitive job environment. The best thing about this store is the management! They owners take very good care of their employees and are always available if you have a concern. We do have long days but you are promised three days off in a row for full time employees. The hardest part is dealing with customers. If you have the initiative to learn about what you sell and pick small tasks you can make a lot in commission, and the owners will promote you quickly! The co-workers are very friendly like a little work family."
good,I had a lot of fun working at Sears. I always had things to do from printing off sale signs to helping stock the floors there was always something that needed to be done. I learned a lot about how stores work and how much work has to be put into opening up a store and keeping it in business. The management was great and always understanding if something came up. Co-workers were always there to help you with any problem you came across.

good,I have learned how to properly open and close the store. How to take care of the daily paper work and deposit. I have learned about all the different appliances and how to properly inform customers of my knowledge of the different appliances. Working at Sears has built my communication and customer service skills; has taught me how to handle every situation that is thrown my way. I have learned how to manage those that are below me and how to lead them to success. Taking responsibility for my actions along with those who I am managing is also a very important learned key aspect.
good,"People are still finding out about the Sears Hometown Outlet in Palmdale, Ca. There can be some incredibly slow days, but over all it was a pleasure to work with the great team and was fun to work together and earn sales. There is definitely a family dynamic at SHO and everyone looks out for one another, it is not a cut throat environment like most commission based jobs."
good,"I would get there count all the money do all the deposits and file all paper work. I would get the store open and ready for a work day. I always make sure all sweeping and mopping was done before the store opened. When all my co workers would show up I would have all their tasks ready for them. My delivery team I would make sure they have everything so they know where they were going, what they were delivering and what they were bring back. If we have anyone new I would train them. I also did the everyday customer service task that any other Sears sales team member would do. I loved my job and all my task I had, most of all the team I worked with was amazing! The hardest part about the job was to leave. I moved from Montrose to Grand Junction."
good,"I have always been a people person.  I am an excellent sales person, and had the opportunity to grow with Sears Hometown Store.  I learned so much about time management, multi-tasking, asking customers the right questions to identify what their needs and desires are.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with people and feeling that I am making a difference in their life.  I am very good at helping people make a decision without pressuring them, but am able to close the deal.  The hardest part of my job was that we were very short staffed, so I had to wear many different ""hats,"" but at the end of the day, the customer always came first.  So sometimes I was stressed to get everything else done that needed to be done.  I am a hard worker, who gets the job done.  I am easy to get along with, and always consider myself a team player."

good,I managed seven employees. Had to do daily paperwork with sales goals for individaul employees and the overall store. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customer service problems beyond my control as I took a lot of the problems personally.

good,"No complaints on my job at Sears Outlet. Retail hours, plenty of responsibility and great bonus plan. Compensation for the job was fair, and there is opportunity for advancement"

If it is a truck day, we make sure to unload as soon as it arrives so it can go to it's next stop. depending on the number of deliveries, we split into one of two teams. There are varying drive times to various locations, but on a normal day, deliveries are completed between three and four in the afternoon. If there is spare time, there are plenty of work to do at the store. Whether it includes assembling customer's orders, restocking the floor, or helping on the sales floor."
