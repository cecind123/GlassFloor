good,"Operating cash registers, customer service, I learned how to be a team leader, management was great, had open door policy, co workers was good to work with, the hardest part of the job was working in garden center, the most enjoyable part of the job was when we had cook outs at work."
good,Highly profitable company. Fast paced enviroment not ideal worklife balance.
good,"As a BIA it was my responsibility to make sure that the pricing on the items in my department were correct to the standard operating practice rule book. These changes were made on a daily basis and had to be completed before I left for the day, time management was a priority for this job."
good,Conducted a store walk of departments. Assigned work duties to employees to be completed by the end of the day. Assigned monthly projects that were assigned by vendors to be completed. Walked off assignments throughout the day as well as projects that were completed. Logged employees hours for the day. Handled inhouse issues and delivered documentation when necessary.
good,Friendly and caring staff. Hours were good. It was a fun place to work.
good,A day at work;
good,"The typical day at Home Depot for me involved helping customers load both big and small merchandise into their vehicles. Lifting and carrying heavy loads all day long. Cleaning the store, making sure it was very presentable and tidy. Making sure the parking lot was spotless with no carts anywhere in site. To make sure that all carts were presented neatly and in an organized fashion for the customer. Answering calls on a walkie talkie to help customers. Clean garbages and always have a smile on my face whether it was a good day or a bad day. Working at Home Depot I learned the importance of working as a team and to work without stopping until the day was done. The management was excellent and very understanding, they provided a very comfortable and position working environment. The hardest part of the job was mostly the winter season for me but that is saying very little compared to all the positive attributes that came with this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the wonderful associates I did aswell as dealing with the very friendly customers that came in. Some of the customers would ask for me specifically which made me feel great and would always make me wanna work harder at my job in hopes that it would happen again."
good,"Days start at AM checking on total store ares and determining what actions to take for the days tasks and customers issues. Was able to grow with the company and advance quickly. Co-workers varied from willing to give it all to I will do as little as I can. Management was to polictical. The weather had an effect on what was happening, but to see all the satisfied customers,made every thing worth it."
good,A normal day is clocking in and checking the board to see where you are placed for the day and what your position will be.
good,I worked and put my all into it but in the end really felt like i was being used and was taken advantage of because of my age and how much managers thought i knew.
good,"I work as a inventory management associate. I scan all outs in different department that way we know what needs to be stocked and ordered for customers. I also change price tags, place new and clearance items in the proper location. I look for lost items in store by helping the department head locate them. Also helping customers in store is always a first priority."

good,"A typical day at work is usually fast paced and team oriented. Tasks are delegated down the chain of command to make sure they get done quickly and efficiently. All the while educating customers on specific products and finding the right one for there needs. So far I've learned the values of teamwork and product knowledge and I hope to continue to learn more. The management system is run very well, employee's know they can turn to there corresponding manager or supervisor in the event that they need something. I think the hardest part of the job is having to cover multiple departments at a time. Especially during a busy time of day. The most enjoyable part of working at the home depot is being able to interact with all types of customers with all types of different needs."
good,I learned allot about DIY work around the house from plumbing to electrical etc. I really loved helping customers figure out their issues and helping them get the right product for the job.
good,My days began with different hours and days schedules. Days began with our Department Head giving us the duties and ending it with the Home Depot CHEER!. I learned of how I was supposed to give a high level customer service. Working with 100's of different employees was an exciting experiment.

The typical day consisted of helping both associates to grow and learn new areas of the store and the computer system. It also involved handling dissatisifed customers as needed and overall the co workers were wonderful down to earth individuals that were easy to get along with and for the main part had great work ethics. As time advanced I was able to grow and learn new areas of the store and eventually promoted. The hadest part of the job was the sometimes heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships that I have developed over the 19 years of working at the Home Depot both with the associates and the customers."

good,"I've worked for Home Depot for almost 10 years now. It's a joyous place to work and you can meet various people. Home Depot gives you growth oppourtunities if that's what your seeking. A typical day at work is nothing but providing excellent customer service as well as multi-tasking. I've learned over the years that being in customer service involves a lot of patients, but it puts a smile on customers face when they feel important and not just a customer.My co-workers are nice and pleasant. They help out when necessary and just fun to be aroung. The hardest part of the job is not making the customers happy. If we can't give them what they came for, we feel we don't satisfy them. The most enjoyable part of the job is laughing and joking with happy customers and co-workers."

Management was the best crew to work with and are very understanding. Coworker you have your pick and chose from the packed.

good,"Speaking from my experience only, there was a inclusivity amongst most employees. Obviously you have your typical high school drama that comes with adult workplaces; but you always had the feeling of acceptance. The work and job itself imo is dead end if you’re looking for serious financial success in life. But with that said, there are gradual raises and profit sharing..also lots of free lunches lol"
good,overall a good experience. While working there I never felt as though I was being disrespected or treated unfairly. Was a great place for a first job.

good,"A typical day at work, you will call customers to make appointments, then leave to go to these appointments in your own vehicle. Compensation for gas is only 15 cents per mile. Slightly more for longer trips. Management is highly responsive to feedback and helps with any issues. Customer service alone can be difficult for some people, but as long as you are self motivated and can work well one on one, this is a great job. A lot of time is spent driving. Working efficiently is to your advantage: you are paid by the job. On larger jobs that take many hours, this is sometimes not worth the pay."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is customer service. The management is great. The hardest part of the job is the different tasks that they assign you.

good,See previous comment. Had an associate the store manager would not allow me to discipline.  I should have gone through corporate. My fault I guess.  Therefore I was a target.  Was let go. I was already dealing with anxiety so I didn't take action even though coworkers urged me to. The whole store an many customers were shocked.

good,"This job requires a lot of walking, climbing and lifting.  Usually heavy lifting.  We would be responsible to pack out all the freight unloaded in the truck.  We had to break down pallets and work carts and sort by aisle and bay to put away properly.  If it didn't pack out, it went in overstock.  There was always a lot of overstock and it was a challenge to find places for it that coincided where the product belonged. Sometimes, we used ladders or a ballymore.  Others required the lifts and to be palletized, shrink wrapped and tagged to go up."

Its a great place to work becuase of the investment they put into taking care of our associates. Inspire associates to perform at their best and seeing the result
good,The Home Depot offers career advancement opportunities and loves to see their associates hungry for learning. They off amazing benefits and it is a very secure job to have. Everyone gets along. They will help you grow within the company and guide you towards success. The compensation is arguable though. They offer competitive pay against minimum wage. but the raises associates receive sometimes don't reflect all the hard work and effort they gave to the company. This is a great company to work for if someone is serious about climbing the ladder though.
good,Team orientation and advancement opportunities are excellent! Fast paced and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a career in a clean safe environment.
good,"I enjoy all the people at the home depot. There is a great work environment. We are all customer friendly. I spend the majority of my time in receiving unloading trucks. In Addition, I put things ups with the order picker."
good,"Same as above. I love everyday working at Home Depot . The only problem is I cannot move up to a better position which forces me to look for another job. It is very possibly a career job, just not for me."
good,The store is great where I work. My only complaint is that not many part-time associates are promoted to full-time. They would rather fill full-time openings with associates from other locations before promoting from within. Very sad.

good,"Typical days at work were slow, but active. We would assist any customers that would come in, if they had questions we would try to answer them or find someone who can. We learned through experience and the communication within the store, if a customer needed to know what he needed to replace his plumbing in this sink and how to do it. someone knew and we listened in so that the next time we can help them or anyone else who had the same questions. Hardest part of the job would have to be holidays, there is not that many of us, but there was a lot of customers flooding in. So we had to try our hardest to answer as many questions as possible, while checking other customers out. The most enjoyable part would be the customers, the stories and connections with them they each bring to the store always made the job better."
good,Fun workplace with a great group of employees. They will work with most schedules with plenty of notice for changes. There are many places within the company to advance too.
good,"I worked as a freight associate and it wasn't bad. There was room to advance if you wanted too. I think what really made the place for me though was my supervisor. She was a true leader, team player and just knew how to effectively run us as a team."
good,It's one big family. Work hard and have a great time. Management is great. Employees are there to help you in any way necessary to become a successful employee. The best environment to work.
good,"I was hired for one position, but had the freedom to take on more job duties. Always kept myself busy with cleaning or helping out in other departments."
good,Was hired and within 3 months promoted to Dept manager and I was a key carrier. I left on good terms after being passed over twice for ASM. I gave my 2 weeks notice and full filled my commitment.
good,"I gave this place 5 stars, but they gave me the door??? really?? I enjoyed being here I could finally breathe, any would love it here, but I felt like close co workers didn't really care for my life style and they let it be known on what I didn't know was gonna be my last day by calling me a Fa_-ot _ss FACTS, real talk. I know what I heard. But it was 1 against 4 to 5. I had no chance at winning it was just me. And the new management was just that very brand new. Thanks a lot HD for letting me down. It really means a lot"
good,"If you want to know the ends and out of working on your own home, the Home Depot is the best place to work. I started an electrical department there didn't know anything about electrical, but through the training at the home Depot and my customers I learned ability my own electrical work at home safely and confidently."
good,Good job fast paced moving up takes awhile but is possible pay is okay. Does have really good benifits and management. Just be prepared to work hard with urgency and a smile.
good,Overall I enjoyed working here. The employees and management we're very friendly. It was just a temporary job for me but I would definitely be interested in working here in the future after I retire.
good,"After starting at Home Depot I completely loved it! I had it set in my mind I would like to retire there. But after a year of working hard in sales, customer service, and doing anything it took; I did not receive one raise. They also completely ignored me when wanting to pursue a full time position, which at the time they had 3 full time openings available at my store. It’s all about who you know at this company. For a student this job is excellent, but if you’re looking to go for the long haul expect to be there for years to come."
good,"worked there 2 years got full time within 6 months, within that 2 years then new mgr started, every day for 1 month people were getting fired. I was 1"
good,"It was a popularity contest  when it came to raises, if management liked you than a raise was guaranteed other than that it was a good company to work for."
good,"Honestly, Home Depot is awesome! I'm not saying that because I'm currently on their payroll, but because they really do care about their employees. The benefits are very competitive, and people care about customers and other coworkers."
good,I just think that the salary should be better and people would not be living the job. The benefits packages are great but the pay and working part time does not work.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Home Depot never had any issues that were not confronted in a fair manner."
good,This job was a relaxed job it helped me with my communication skills. Resulting in getting better with socializing. And it’s a good first job if your 16 to 18.
good,Depends how you are as to whether its a good fit for a job. Benefits are pretty good.  Not a hard job. Employees you work with are really great. Pay is ok(not the worst or not the best). Schedules are flexible for part time employees
good,"Great people, good management,  not enough hours, cashier job is kind of boring. They tend to freak out of there is more then 1 person in line at a time."
good,"I planned on only working part time as a second job but I’m so happy at work I’d like to be able to be full time to be eligible for medical benefits. I’m very thankful that I took this job as it makes me move & get in shape! The people I work with are funny and the people who we serve are always entertaining good & bad. In customer service you just need to remember not to take things personally, some people are grumpy and others just maybe having a hard time in their lives"
good,"Always busy with customers, vendors, phone calls, associates, training and working with management. I've learned to multi-task in all aspects of  Home Depot's merchandise, in-store or online, along with helping contractors needs. Management is in the building to help with any issues. Employee engagement, Responsibility/Accountability, Decision Making, Teamwork, Goals/Strategy. Work schedule uses to be different every week but are set hourly schedules now. The best part of working at Home Depot is every day is different and you're never bored and tired of the job. The Home Depot associates are your family. Volunteering outside of Home Depot to build playgrounds at parks & schools. The most rewarding volunteer job is when you help out the Veterans by building homes and landscape for their family's. It's quite rewarding to give back."
good,working overnight putting away freight is nice but also hurts your social life  and trying to do anything during the day although weekends off is always a plus
good,Very nice place to work with a lot of benefits. the workplace culture is very exceptional with people from everywhere in the world. You have a flexible schedule which is very good.
good,Everyone was really nice and helpful. Hours were very flexible and I was able to get days off if I asked in advance. You don’t have to know all about the product to work there. There is a lot of help from floor employees.
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work, the management is great and it feels like a family. They care about their associates and encourage them to seek advancement within the company."
good,This job was my first job and honestly it was great. I hated nothing about it. They truly made you feel at home at the Home Depot. I just wish I could’ve stayed there longer.
good,"I started in December 2009 at $9.00 he but after 90 days and NO MISSED Days/Time I got a .50 cent raise then annually you have a performance review in which case they based your raise off of that. The issue with that is the whole store is allotted a certain dollar amount and between 200 employees it got divided up! Now I believe it was 2% was the highest possible for anyone to get. Until I took the supervisor position which bumped me up to $14.00hr, and raises actually got lower once you made more hourly! They'd keep alot more employees if pay was increased because everyone I know absolutely lived working there! I had to leave for Oakview for the pay increase!"
good,"I worked at two locations, i really liked it at the first one but second one wasn't that good. Its a good company to work for, there is room for advancement and you will get recognized for good work. Sometimes its hard to find customers and sometimes it gets crazy busy. Its easy to transfer to other departments or store if u don't like yours."
good,"a day work begins with a brief of your duties for the day , such as how many hours do perform a duty and what is needed from you for the day. I experienced and learned the skills of team managment and time management, the workplace culture was not good as they would differentiate between gender roles as more hours would be given to the women to be at the front end of the store as the men were given heavy lifting and behind the show tasks, and less appreciation. The difficult job of work was lifitng the items and working in hot weather conditions. best part of the job was getting a breaks every few hours such as 15 minute breaks every 2 and half hour and then 3o minute lunch every 5 hours ."
good,Loved working here it is a fun and enjoyable place to work. Management and supervisor were excellent no complains at all. Loved the fact of helping customers and my coworkers.
good,i learned how to drive forklift from home depot and many more things.the job is easy just require attention and focus .its good place to work because stuff are friend and customers as well
good,Overall this is an amazing company to work for. I would recommend applying for any job position that fits your experience. The company is always hiring but starting wage is not always competitive. Don’t be afraid to ask for what you are worth.
good,"The Home Deport Is A Fast Past Setting! The Customers are our number one prority, they help employees fulfill daily goals, such as sales and providing great customer service!"
good,Awesome work culture and environment.  Pay is on the low end of the scale but advancement is available. Awesome training available.  Low manpower causes employees to have to work harder causing some customers to become frustrated at times.
good,"I loved my time at Home Depot and I did my best to meet and exceed expectations, my time spent was well used and I enjoyed every minute of it, if happily go back if offered the chance"
good,Great company to work for. Wonderful learning experience. I learned a lot when working there they made sure we learned other departments no matter which one you were in. Knowing the ins and outs of the company is great thing.
good,"All new hires go threw computer based training in the department in which they are hired before going onto the sales floor."
good,"Such a great company to work for I love the people I work with, my job goes by so fast when I go into work it’s something new to do every day , also I learn new things everyday."
good,Ideally I wanted to continue working in warehouse environments since I work well with my hands. I think working at Home Depot gave me a good experience to continue learning more about warehouse related processes and even a chance to become a lead and train future employees.
good,"I had five years experience tried to transfer to Florida from Maryland .Was told no jobs available by H.R. in Clermont.  But assistant managers told me there was openings. I liked working there,and was hoping to continue. Working with the customers and getting to know their needs was interesting and also helped sales.I had 20 cashiers to direct every day. I also communicated to the superviser and store  manager regulary. It was hard leaving my job because of all the friends I made."
good,This is a great place for younger people to get experience in the work force. Promotes advancement from within. Fast paced and challenging work. Great for experience.
good,I enjoyed work at night. The manager was easy to get along with the staff. I dont really have to lot to say. It's been a while since I have worked there.  The manager made sure you got to your car safely(being it was at night). I felt safe Working there
good,"I was hired on with no Sundays but when my supervisor went on disability I was scheduled  for 12  sundays and if you dont find someone to work for you and you call off then after aso many your fired ."
good,"A typical day at work Is helping to make customer decision a lot easier on selecting items for their home."
good,"really enjoyed being at HD. i always had a blast with the managers and supervisors. they made it someplace fun to work. overall, i enjoyed my time there, evevn on the super crazy days."
good,"My typical day at work is cool when i first walk in, sign in and start answering phones helping customer with their measurements. I have learned how to talk to customers on the phone helping them with whatever problem they are having. Work place culture is cool have no issues so far. My hardest part of my job is getting my check corrected every week but the most enjoyable part of my job is helping a satisfied customer and meeting new people there that seems to be pretty cool and helpful with training me."
good,"Didn't work there long, but enjoyed my time. Management was good, great environment, not many hours, but a great place just the same. Would definitely recommend."
good,Home Depot has been a great experience and a overall great working environment and has showed me the upmost respect. I would work for Hone Depot anytime.
good,"I clocked in and served as many customer as possible in a friendly welcoming matter."
good,This job was a very good place to learn basic necessities of DIY and gives great advice on jobs to do outside of the store. You meet people who can help you along your way and teach you valuable tips to carry with you for your work experience.
good,You will encounter an angry customer who needs a product now for there job or something every now and then but other than that the work environment was great filled with friendly hard working people. Even if you don't know anything about whatever department you definitely become somewhat of an expert after a while
good,I mainly enjoyed working for Home Depot did too the fact I learned soo much about home appliances. My staff members were awesome I enjoyed my tome there
good,"management was great, I really enjoyed working at the home depot. work place was always clean and the employees of THD were always so nice. the customers were great as well. I highly recommend working at the home depot"
good,I like the people I work with. They are fun and friendly. Management host monthly parties for employees to share food and fun. I get to meet lots of dogs and kids.
good,"We would stock and organize shelves according to a planogram while occasionally helping customers with questions. I learned a lot of organizational skills and safety measures when working with dangerous tools and spills. The hardest part of the job was when holidays would come around and we had to tear down entire shelving units and restructure them for holiday products and displays. The best part about the job was how I worked in the garden department most mornings watering the plants. I absolutely loved working with the plants, weeding pruning and making sure they were getting the love and care they needed."
good,The Home Depot has great employee benefits and is worth looking into especially if you are new to working. On the busy days you will have alot of customers waiting for the same thing so that's frustrating. It's a good place all in all!
good,"The company culture is amazing and that is rare in Atlanta. The only downside is THD payscale is way behind compared to other competitors, which HR is aware of. Overall great place to work."
good,Una buena empresa con muy buenas prestaciones y aquí la gente obtiene capacitaciones constantes
good,"I liked the job at first, it became harder for me by the day only because of how much work we had to finish each day. That specific job is more so for men."
good,Great company to work for that has a lot of values they live by and instill into their associates. Lots of training opportunities to learn a variety of the store.

good,Great company to work for that has a lot of values they live by and instill into their associates. Lots of training opportunities to learn a variety of the store.
good,I was a cashier for home depot for some time.  I was able to develop a lot of knowledge about  Home repair products. I cashiered here so I was handling money daily and helping customers make sure they got the right products.
good,This is a wonderful retirement job for me.  Awesome team of employees. Family feeling and if you have a problem people try and help. Great starter job for a young person and for an older retirement person
good,They train you to be the best at what you do. And help you get certified and trained on your skills. You are allowed to work over time if they allow it. Or need help.
good,I would unload the truck and stock in the paint and lumber and flooring departments and help in all other departments cause i was a team lead. regular 30 minute lunch no 15 minute break
good,"desequilibrio en área gerencial, no cumplen con los valores de la empresa al 100% hay mucho favoritismo"
good,Its a good place to start your career after landing as an permanent resident. Staff is very helpful. Management is very approachable and friendly.....
good,"Overall, Home Depot is a great company to work for. The people tend to be genuine and respectful of one another. Management at some locations can sometimes take advantage of their employees by putting their workloads and management duties on others to take care of.  Credit and individual recognition could be improved."
good,My 1st job and I was a head cashier and enjoyed my time working for HomeDepot and all the experience in face to face customer service experience. This was a very exciting job.
good,"It is a really relaxed and fun place to work, you can learn a lot if you apply yourself. The management was friendly and professional. Everyone gets along and has their own place and is very friendly. The hardest part of the job was rainy days and maybe finding something to do on slow or empty days. The most enjoyable part was assisting customers and helping them, feeling proud of all you learned to be able to assist them with their projects and tending to the garden."
good,I really do love working for the home depot. It is by far the best retail environment to work for. I have come to terms with finally working for a company that values their employees.
good,The Rockwall Home Depot provides decent pay and multiple opportunities for work but the management team is political. It can be hard to get promoted if you do not get on their good side.
good,"Home depot was a temporary job while I was going to school.  They allowed a flex schedule to accommodate classes.  They offered great benefits, and they have the Homer Fund which I saw in action when one of our employees needed personal help.  They dipped into the Homer fund and assisted this employee during a hard time in their life.  I was touched by the program.  Still one of the best programs of any company I have ever worked for."
good,"I love my Home Depot family! It's a great Company to work for. I like my freight job. It's hard work, but the hours work for my family. Home Depot offers a lot of new benefits, too. I'd welcome anyone 18 years & older to apply."
good,I honestly loved working here the only downside was the lack of hours and that cashiers could only work part time at that location. hands down one of the best places I have ever worked though. never had a business besides this one that worked with the workers when it came to life or school or whatever happened. our store even offered weekend only positions for those that could only work weekends.
good,"I had lots of fun working as a cashier at the Home Depot in Provo, UT. I started with really good pay for a high school student cashier, starting at $11/hr and the company offers amazing benefits to their employees. Even their part-time employees like 401k, tuition reimbursement, etc."
good,Learnt a  lot and was able to maintain a prefect balance between family and work life.Management is very helpful and work culture is good. There are new tools available to learn a lot.
good,Home Depot was a good company to work for.  The training provided to associates was some of the best and most thorough I have received from any employer.  The managers I worked with were very professional and led with a purpose.
good,"Both very friendly and very professional work atmosphere."
good,Fine place to work for those that take care of business. Can't say much for management staff for day shift as I worked overnight but management for overnight shift was pretty solid. Overnight crew was consistently recognized and rewarded by management for good work performance. Most often the lack of day crew completing task overlapped and make the work for night crew a little harder. Day crew had a very bad habit of using lift equipment and not putting on charge for night use so night crew would lose valuable time charging up equipment.
good,"I would arrive to check all special orders , calling customers to check scheduling , restock supplies in our area reorder stock , help customers with picking out correct materials per application and helping customers in different areas of store"
good,"Provide excellent customer service to ensure a great shopping experience; hardest part of job achieving 100% customer satisfaction (ie inventory limitations, delivery schedules) most enjoyable part of the job achieving 100% customer satisfaction"
good,Company tovadvancecskills and customer service Much too learn about home imp and customer service. Required Accuracy. Company with much products and services available. Research ways to save customer money.
good,"Home depot gives a lot of freedom to it's associated allowing them to use their decision-making skills in everday decision making. They also offer benefits to their employees for a reasonable price. During the season all associates including part-time, get a reasonable amount of hours."
good,Excellent in given the skills necessary to demonstrate tasks given. Ability to advance given self drive and attention to detail. Shifts were fixed but there was the sense of understanding in trying to help with schedules given associate issues.
good,"My day at work would consist on helping everyday customers looking for a new door, a new window, or some new moulding for their home. I learned to have much more patience with the customers. I learned new programs in the computer."
good,Personally felt very good working here. Work Life balance is Very good. Good Support by the team and management. Good techinal and for sure up to date Technologies.
good,I enjoy taking care of our customers with respect & courtesy as well as interacting with them.  I also help solve any issues they might be having as well as helping them to decide the proper materials
good,Great company advancement and opportunities are there if you work hard.Bonus based on store performance 401 lots of benefits and stock options loved working there
good,"Very good place to work at , great environment, very well run work place . Hours and pay are good, and work with scheduling if needed . Highly recommended."
good,"dependent on the season it can be quiet busy or quiet dead within the store, while I enjy working within the home depot scheduling of more then one associate in certain departments would be perferable"
good,The most enjoyable part about working for Home Depot is your coworkers become family. The hardest part of was the inability to go to church on Sundays. I was very involve with my church prior to being employed but had to discontinue my work.
good,Awesome place to work. Provided great benefits. Room for advancement and willing to train in different departments. Warm work culture. Wonderful management.
good,Always ready to engage and work with my team .energetic and enthusiastic at my work place friendly customer care .working here is a great atmosphere with groups of professionals who are always ready to help if needed.
good,"I've had the opportunity to work at two Home Depot locations - Naples, FL and Covington, LA."
good,"Worked at home depot for nearly a year. I had to leave because of personal issues. My first experience with home depot was ""wow"" fast pace. i wasn't use to a environment like that. I used my communication skills to communicate with customers for a calmer experience. You'll bump into some really aggressive disrespectful customer but a calm relax person can handle a aggressive customer. "
good,"Excelente empresa te capacitan muy bien pagada "
good,Custo er aervice driven company with a strong culture and great products at tremendous values the company loves promote within this is a co pany with great diversity
good,"Awesome place to work. I to this day enjoy shopping there and talking with fellow coworkers. THD provides you with every tool you need to do your job safely and efficiently. I would work there again. They have an amazing understanding of people from different walks of life and cultures. I would highly recommend this job for someone who appreciates strong work culture and fun, rewarding work."
good,Easy going workplace. Management is great especially supervisors; they are always helpful and always willing to help. Recreation center available for employees during their break time.
good,They trained me and supported me even though I was only there for a few months. The job was kinda hard and had a learning curve but its not too hard. Great place to work
good,"Overall, a great place to work. At times we were expected to work above our pay grade. I only resigned from HD because I needed to change work hours for school and they would not accommodate."
good,Capacitación constante y se aprenden cosas nuevas cada día.
good,easy job but management can be a pain to work with depending on the store. The company uses a lot of analytics so they time the amount of time it takes for you to complete a task so you need good time management  skills.
good,"Usually when you walk into the home depot, you will clock in and go straight to your designated work station. For example if you are a garden worker you would go to the garden side of home depot. I learned how to become a better stocker and was able to learn how to assist customers in a friendly matter."
good,Best place I have worked since the Marine Corps. Everyday was challanging to keep you gowing to be a great team player. Gives you the freedom to grow much as you can.
good,"Working in Customer Service was very fast paced.  I loved it. It was a challenge.  I enjoyed the working environment and family oriented atmosphere in that department.  There was always opportunity to work in different departments to become more knowledgeable."
good,"Home Depot is has great benefits and treats their associates nice, the management is a little unorganized though. With so many workers it’s dificult to be able to talk to management or get any problems you have fixed"
good,Home Depot is a great place to start a career and grow.  The company teaches excellence and culture in everything you do.  These models have created much success and will also make you successful throughout your career.
good,"A typical day working there was fast paced and competitive "
good,"I came from the Anaheim Hills  Home Depot  that place was like my Home all managers and associate and also customers we so helpful and nice I worked really hard and they appreciated everything I do but I have to transfer to closer to home in Riverside it was hard there I still worked really hard but hardley "
good,Home Depot is a well established and well structured company overall. It has a good workplace culture. I was able to learn a lot regarding leadership skills. They have profit sharing and a Homer Fund which is used for associates in need of assistance among other benefits.
good,Working at the Home Depot gives you a second family. Everyone is so sweet and they all focus one thing and that is customer service. Since we all have one goal we all work together well and efficiently.
good,Una empresa que aprecia mucho a sus asociados y los hace sentir como en casa
good,I would go back if management changed. They are very much a man's job world. Buy if you work hard and stay out of drama then your job is very easy to complete
good,Not enough help in outside gardening and no increase for driving heavy equipment and paid the same as those who do not. Department Manager not experience in the dept and never help out.
good,"I have learned how to stack carts, flat carts and baskets and in seasonal ive watered the plants for the entire summer and in the fall of 2011 did not receive enough hours on my schedule"
good,Very flexible and understanding. Manager are excellent as well as the staff. What you will learn is about all the ins and outs about the job and company with no stress.
good,"Overall its a great place to learn and have opportunities for advancement. Great benefits, and friendly between customers and associates. New job positions are always posted"
good,We have to get people to anything they want and let them know that we have deals and we have to make sales by the end of the day. We attract people by telling them of that need anything done we can do it.
good,"Every day it was hands on work type of day, learning something new that you can use in your everyday life. co-workers willing to lend you a hand when  you needed help. You are able to learn from other sections of the store which it will let you move later on."
good,Not the best paying job but easy to do. Hours are not consistent. Management is very friendly and understanding. Not the best health insurance options.
good,"easy to talk to employee and management, but like all retail positions customers cam be hard to deal with. i would recommend asking for a higher wage from start, 10 cent raise per year sucks"
good,"Good place to work, good management , and there is opportunity to work your way up to management. Recomend for students looking for a flexible schedule."
good,Every day I learn something new from my fellow Associates. Every associate is helping and kind. Home depot have good management systems. My supervisor always tell us that team work is dream work. We always help customers by Putting them first.
good,"I worked part time and had different shifts everyday, never the same. I liked the people I worked with .  We worked well as a team unit.  The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items and ladder work.  I enjoy helping customers with their projects."
good,"I would personally not make it my career,  but I know plenty who excelled at it being theirs. They truly do care about their employees. Management is usually good to work with as well."
good,Great place to work even you just want part-time. Every one works as a team to accomplish that same goals. Advancement opportunities always available. Care about their associates and what is going on in their lives. Always willing to help.
good,"A typical day at work is a 9hr shift with 2 short breaks and a 1 hour lunch. Home Depot has helped me with my Retail skills. Management has an open door policy.  The work environment is fun and professional. The hardest part is working in garden when the elements are bad, but on nice days it's a lot of fun. The best part of my job is helping customers."
good,"Where I worked was very relaxing. The customer's were a lot of regulars, so it was more like a family environment. I wished I could have learned more positions for the company but I would help other employees if they needed."
good,"The culture is great - due to the size, employees know each other and it is much like a family. Everyone looks out for each other and knows each other. A fun place to work. Management, however, keeps to themselves and does not participate in that family."
good,"taking phone calls and assisting customers in helping them track down, place orders or return items is not something that I thought I would enjoy,  but turns out i'm really good at it"
good,Good Company. Good culture. Liked the people and location. Good management and a lot of things going on to keep the day interesting. You will like the Home Depot experience.
good,"Home Depot does an excellent job at creating a comfortable environment to work in. They are flexible, understanding, and willing to meet you in the middle for your needs. I went in specializing in Paint, and have been offered ample opportunity to learn other departments in order to have a more well rounded approach to attending to customer's needs. The most difficult part of the job is finding an appropriate balance between tending to customers and performing daily duties, but is extremely doable. There is emphasis on the customer coming first, and enthusiasm and friendliness is encouraged in the workplace culture."
good,Working for home depot was a great experience. The only reason I left was because I had a devastating family tragedy and needed some time off. I might go try and be rehired for the holiday season and beyond
good,very good job but not enough hours very competitive. when it comes time to take off at work it's alway seniority first although the event could have been important. I really did enjoy this job but it was not fusible and it's a lot of favoritism
good,This is a fast paced environment.  It is a great place to work Part Time.  I would recommend this employer to someone who is looking to get out of the house.
good,"Working at the Home Depot can be very fun. You really do learn something new every day because of the different customers we help on a daily basis. Managers make you feel welcome, like you can approach them regarding any problem or concern you may have"
good,Great place to work. Great benefits. Set schedules for full time associates suck but other than that it is a great place to work. Learned a lot working there.
good,It was a fun place to me to work. Had very good co workers and very nice Supervisors and some outstanding customers.And average day for me would just be providing excellent customer service
good,Working there helped me improve my skills of branching out from what I'm used to I was to taking care of seniors basically a caretaker upon taking this job I gained a opportunity that I will never forget. The people I met through this opportunity has pushed me towards better things and I hated to get let go after my 120 days I felt that I was a valuable part of the team
good,Great for people who want to be on their feet and work hard on the job.The Home Depot has just enough jobs for you. Find out more what kind of work they have and apply today!
good,The Home depot could be a much better place to work if they didn't expect you to know everything and the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers
good,Home Depot is great place to work. Just gotta be willing to help and keep cool head. You get lot of heavy lifting when comes to helping certain customers.
good,"Always busy, always something new to learn. Great people, everyone works hard and smart and helps each other out. Not sure about how the benefits are, I am VA and was military, never needed to use the benefits."
good,I liked working at Home Depot. Management treated me good. I don't know why because they treated some employees badly. they could of payed better. I don't know how a full time employee could have a family and a house and a car and work one job!!!!! I don't know maybe Management liked me because I worked every day I was scheduled and I did my job.
good,"I have learned an amazing amount of useable material at Home Depot and have thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I have grown as a person a great deal due to the management, mentorship and extensive training. I am planning to pursue transfers within the company if can find one that does not require a large commute. The atmosphere there is like having extended family."
good,"As with any retail company you are going to have your ups and downs.  Sometimes it can get a little crazy.  Take black Friday for instance, but that's just the nature of the industry.  HD as a whole is a great company to work for.  Especially when you have a great management team....which we did."
good,A typical day in the office of The Home depot is very fast past and high call volume office and overtime is optional and offered on a regular basis with the company.
good,"I worked at Home Depot for 12.5 years. At 5 different stores. All very large stores (48 million/yr to 125 million/yr). While I am progressed up to Assistant Store Manager there were numerous paths I could have taken that would have lead me in a different path. Do not be afraid to voice your opinion, do not be afraid to do what is in the best interest of the company. Politics play a part but that is the same at any company anywhere. I was given a fair shake at every level and do not regret a minute of my time spent there. If you work hard and are willing to do what it takes there is nothing stopping you from progressing to whatever position your interested in. Go for it. I am not with the company and get nothing out of influencing people."
good,"The Home Depot family is a wonderful set of ppl the let me felt like I'm one of there own the first day I walk through there door, there times when the work is overflowing but there no work that's easy. This job is a great part time job"
good,Home Depot is a great place to work fast pace and enjoyable. They spend the money needed to train and develop their employees. Most employees are long term associates.
good,"A typical day at work was quick-paced and constantly productive, if there were any delays it was because of the conveyor was backed up or computer was down. Overall though, it was always busy and would usually have overtime on Saturday."

good,"Home Depot holds a place near and dear to my heart, as my first job. I met wonderful people who dedicate their life as employees at Home Depot and bleed orange. I learned how to run credit sales, I led a women's workshop, and I learned how to place orders for customers over the phone. The workplace and work environment is fun, as far as work goes. Customers are mostly handymen and construction companies, so they plan to be in and out fast and with the correct items. It is enjoyable and fun place to work. The hardest part of the job was early mornings opening at 6 AM. Other than that, I recommend Home Depot as a great first job for anyone, as well as a regular full-time and part-time job."
good,I'd recommend home depot to people to work there. The pay is unfair for the tasks they ask of one person to do on a nightly basis. They aren't appreciative of the work you do.
good,Overall Home Depot is a good place to work.  Management and Supervisors all are willing help/support you in any fashion they can to help you in your current position and with helping you grow/advance within the company.
good,"When the culture changed the company changed. I started in 1985 and it was the most awesome job I have ever had in my life to this day. However, when it became a ""corporate"" environment and the attitude towards the employees changed it was a tough place to stay positive."
good,Good experience as working in a very hard working management of the company. Great appreciation from the management which encourages a good worker and motivates to work more efficiently.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"I love working with the best and most unusual people, both co-workers and customers. I have a knack at making a bad day turn good with words and a smile. I have held supervisory positions without the title and am not ashamed to say so. If you have a difficult customer, you have to adjust and know it's not you. If you take one second and step back, breathe, return. ""How is that I can help you?"" It's all about the release. Walk away smiling."
good,"The  working environment is ok, but at times we take a lot of verbal abuse from customers and it is very difficult to not say anything back and ignore."
good,"Worked here for two years, definitely had its ups and downs but I enjoyed my experience there. Over all the amazing customers was the thing that kept me happy!"
good,Very busy place to work and changes with the seasons. Have to be quick on your feet and not afraid to work with customers. Def a place you can grow as a career.
good,"daily schedule is highly variable."
good,"I have been working at The Home Depot full-time"
good,"The Home Depot was a great first long-term employer. I love the store I work in and the people I work with, and over the course of the year that I've worked there, the people I work with have become like family to me. My only complaint is that the starting rate of pay or even what I make after my annual raise isn't enough to live off of."
good,"Early hours are a drain on my shift. Work is interesting and challenging.overall good place The company is family oriented and that is good trair"
good,"I consider most of my co-workers to be a part of my extended family. I have gained many valuable skills working at this establishment.! Not only do you develope great friendship with co-workers at work, you become friends outside of work too."
good,"Very relaxing yet challenging job, fun and very focused on customer experience. Is very ''human'' and understands the limits and assets of each employee."
good,"The days were long and filled with work. However, the work was fast paced and exciting. Learned something new almost daily. Was given a great deal of space to perform and complete my responsibilities."
good,"It's essentially like being a cashier's manager at any other retail job (drama with cashiers, having to deal with people that are lazy/don't care, some people are super reliable and others not so much, etc.). The customers expect for you to be a general contractor and know absolutely everything, but honestly, after some time, you'll start picking up on things here and there, especially if you talk to the pro customers. The most frustrating thing for me was how the store managers rarely come to the front end to see how it actually functions, instead of just looking at the statistics and making detrimental changes based off of them, but I guess that's just how many jobs are at times. That's not to say that they're bad, but that's just how the job inherently is because of how busy they get. Speaking of which, taking care of the front end is a bunch of work, which will definitely keep you busy and running around all over the store, but once you get used to the rushes and the strengths/weaknesses of your cashiers, the job will get progressively easier. It's honestly a pretty good job as long as you maintain a good rapport with your team and make sure you listen to what they have to say because sometimes you definitely do have to stand up for them at times."
good,"Great place to work people are respectful, not too much stress but although there are times where things gets a bit stressful but it's work it can't always be easy and we have to deal with it to improve the company's quality at all time."
good,a good place to work over all but only want to make most people part time so they dont have to give health plan they are good place towork just not quit enuff hours
good,My work experience at Home Depot was good. It was my first full time job after graduating high school.. I like working for Home Depot. I enjoyed my working experience
good,I was a loss prevention officer for The Home Depot for a few years.  It was ok at first but they make it extremely hard to apprehend thieves by enforcing strict policies. They also require a certain number of apprehensions per quarter.
good,I started working for The Home Depot as a loss prevention officer and ended up selling appliances. It was a great place to work and seemed to always put my family first.
good,"Great place to work, meet lots of different cultures there with a variety of projects, always fun and interesting.Plus you learn somthing new everyday"
good,Excellent Place to work. Highly Recommended. Enjoyed the fast pace environment which Home Depot thrived on. It's employees are treated very well. It's a fantastic company to work for.
good,"Working at the Home Depot was great! There was never a boring day. Between the regular customers, new customers and even the family-like associates the made work fun. BBQ's when the weather was nice. When it was someones birthday everyone knew it and everyone always got a cake. The Home Depot is a great place to work."
good,"I learned a lot form home depot, like helping customers to find there products and advice them about which product is better for them. Also, I learned hot to be a good person at customer service."
good,"This was an amazing place to work. very friendly staff. Great training program, very understanding supervisors and flexible scheduling. perfect for anyone attending school"
good,working here is great especially for a first timer. for a part time its great because itll take months before becoming full time but if you stay committed then itll work out.
good,"Great environment, although a touch sexist. Very supportive when it comes to learning more about ones department. Clean employee breakroom and restroom."
good,"Opening and closing my department, completing the procedures to start or end the day.  I've learned knowledge of various products in my department.  Working with supervisors that worked side by side with me to ensure customer satisfaction.  Fast paced, lively, and good customer service!  Lifting products off shelf by hand that were over a certain amount of weight.  Greeting  customers , being knowledgeable of products that the customer wanted to purchase.  Working with other employees that didn't hesitate to help me when the customer and I needed the help. Seeing customers satisfied with my knowledge of the products they've invested to purchase."
good,Working at Home Depot is a wonderful experience. ... Great culture and opportunities for advancement. They provide great benefits too. I recommend it to anyone.
good,"I liked working at the home depot, like anywhere else management could be a pain with crazy expectations, but I like helping customers and fixing their problems. So It was good for me."
good,A great place to start with chances for advancement. Provides opportunity for young people and older people too. Many people work there post retirement to keep busy and feel the accomplishment.
good,It’s a good place to work. Tough at first but they’ll help you along the way with anything that you may not comprehend fully. I enjoyed my time there & would recommend people to go for if they want to learn some new skills that can help outside the workplace
good,a typical work day would include maintaining cleanliness of my department and making sure everything is fully stocked. along with that I would answer any questions customers had while assisting them to figure out the materials they needed and also helping them load.
good,typical day would be just being a friendly cashier. i learned how to have a happy attitude. loved the management such a fun place to work. the work place was a safe place where everyone got along. most enjoyable part were work parties and working with other cashiers
good,The Home Depot was a great place to work. The only reason I left was the schedule...there was no guarantee of days off. Lowe's provides a rotating schedule and you have 2 Sundays per month off and one complete week end.
good,Its great place. I love it.. The people are great. and they go on your schedule not theirs.. That's awesome busy people.Thank you home depot.. thank you soo much
good,The job can be stressful since you deal with live people all day long while still trying to get your duties as an associate done but management is reasonable and hard work is rewarded.
good,"Great place to work, pay is low. Management is great. Benefits are good. Worked overnight throughout the District setting seasonal sets and resetting modular and special project from the home office."
good,"The Home Depot has a very strong culture and an extensive network. As an intern, I was given a well-rounded experience and I was exposed to many learning opportunities."
good,I really like this job but things came up and I was able to work anymore my managers were nice and also my coworkers always got along well it was fast pace not stressful at all.
good,"Honestly as jobs go.  This is definitely one of the best ones that I’ve worked at. Hours are flexiBle if your in school like me.  They offer incentives and awards. Success sharing (which is depending on how well the store Does in sales) then you get a bonus check. They don’t offer you a store discount HOWEVER, they do offer you discounts for other things like a percent off your phone bill, traveling discounts, movie tickets, electronics discounts etc. it’s reLly awesome management works with you if you have a problem. Yes there are definitely a couple manger issues here and there but that’s mostly that some managers are either in the back just inspecting people and overseeing  while other mangers are on the floor with you helping out ringing customers up. Making it. Little less stressful for their employees. So it pretty much balances out.   Coworkers are all amazing, everyone in the store goes out of their way to help one another if we need it. Job advancement is awesome. You move up fairly quickly if you do your job and if that’s what you want to do. They also have a career path if you want to set goals for that."
good,"An amazing, flexible job especially if you are a teenager looking for a first or new job. Everything is on the website and easy to access, plus they are very flexible with hours you wish to work or when needing to leave out of state for fun or family."
good,Didnt really learn anything basically like working in factory but i was tight with my supervisor teaching me a thing or two about management. And their atmosphere at Home Depot is a customer first mentality. There's all kinds of chill people that worked there so it wasnt ever boring.
good,You never knew what was going to happen on a typical day there which made working fun. The most satisfying part of the Job was helping costumers solve problems and come up with solutions for there DIY project
good,"Helping people with their projects they wanted to perform in their homes. Helped with childrens workshops helping kids learn how to make different types of bird houses and tool boxes, etc."
good,"I would highly recommend working at Home Depot if you have no previous job experience, They will guide you in your journey and make sure you are equipped for the job."
good,"Exceptional management team inspires excellence at every level.  The company has strong core values and is passionate about giving back and taking care of their people.  As in any retail industry, tasks and projects change daily which keeps energy and motivation elevated.  The most difficult part of the role was keeping informed of updates and changes to policy and processes. The Home Depot is a challenging but very rewarding company to work for."
good,"Home Depot works with Veterans, promotes community involvement. The people are friendly and caring. I think anyone seeking a part time job, possibly full time, should consider this company."
good,"Management is always encouraging, appreciative, & accessible. They are also very flexible. They will go out of their way to help associates with anything & everything. They provide company success sharing and fun reward events, parties, & holiday free food gatherings."
good,"Varies when it is busy and slow depending on the hours of the day. Capable of learning new departments but not as much advancement for employees. The workplace is friendly and accepting, the hardest part of the job is having departments be short of staff and trying to find what the customer wants. The most enjoyable part is appreciation of employees."
good,"During night shifts we are provided a list of tasks we must complete. However, our managers are relatively laid back and rarely micromanage our progress. You should expect to lift heavy items occasionally"
good,It is a niche market and also a niche with regards to employment where you are depended on by a group and must collaboratively combine efforts to get things done.  This was the downside being that there are egos and clicks and either you fit in or you are a lone ranger.
good,I have loved working at Home Depot for the past 8 years and basically grew up with the company since I was hired right out of high school. Throughout those years I had my ups and downs but this past shift in management showed me that Home Depot is looking to promote as many people as possible without them having all the proper background knowledge or relationship skills. It has basically left everyone else without proper guidance and what feels like an inability to move up with our immediate superiors don't even know what is going on.
good,"With home depot being a fast paced job, it motivated me to work hard at work, as well as when I'm off work. I was an athlete, so al the lifting and moving back and forth helped in ways."
good,"I believe that, like most things, you get from it what you put in to it. My time in the tool rental department was great. I learned a lot of things associated with construction and also big yard tools. It will be helpful when I get a home. Also learned how to mix paint and assist customers with selections on different things."
good,Homedepot is a good organisation for IT employees and other people. They offer good work life balance. They have good values and morals and pretty much like the work location
good,When I was working at The Home Depot I would assist hundreds of customer's in the Electrical Department. Stock the shelves during Power-Hour and help.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Working for Home Depot has been a privilege. If you're looking for both on the go with high energy during the busy season, this is the ideal job. I learned and became certified with the stand-up and sit-down reach trucks. Learning their store hand held devices to ensure a better quality of customer care was new and easy. Management was very approachable and willing to work with the employee should the situation call for it; open door policy. The most difficult part of the job was having to wait for a special order to come in. Working with like minded high energy coworkers made for a fast paced day."
good,"Any home depot has great people working there , simply cause the stores are usually alot more organized and have less to do on the job which makes great for customer relation or catching up on extra work, managers are all usually easy-going and helpful, and also they always celebrate holidays with food and snacks and give pay on holidays."
good,"On an average day I support my department as well as D24 Paint which I love to do, Everyone helps out each other it is like having an extended family,"
good,"diverse associates, nice people, lumber was cool, didn't get many hours as a 'seasonal' worker, still a nice place to work. accepting environment, always something to do."
good,"Great Place to work. Loved working with customers, Management was very supportive, Didn't work with my direct supervisor much so training wasn't all that great."
good,I enjoy my work experience at the Home Depot. They are very flexible with schedules and allow me to come back from college and work over break. They pay well and associates treated me with respect. I recommend this job to anybody that currently goes to college and comes back on summer breaks.
good,"This was the best company I have ever worked for, hands down. When I decided to resign from the company, it had to have been one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. It was extremely difficult for not only myself, but the staff as well. It was extremely diverse. Only thing that I would change is the pay, considering the area in which I worked."
good,"Clock in on the phone, "
good,"Everyone at the home depot looks out for each other and we all act as a family. Though some of us fight we're still a family.Typically as a cashier you go to the middle where your head cashier will tell you what register to be on and from there they guide you through breaks and lunches until its time to go home. "
good,It is a good step in the door for a retail position. The people are good people to work with they are helpful when you ask questions. You will have to see some unhappy customers but overall it is quite fun to work here.
good,"i had a great experience working here, i’d love to go back! they really cared about the employees individually and as a team. co-workers felt like family and the benefits of working there are tremendous!"
good,"The pay could be a bit more but it didn't matter to me. I enjoyed working there every day that I was able to. Great co-workers and managers, they made it a great atmosphere to work in."
good,"Great opportunity for advancement, benefits are great. They reward their employees with bonuses. Very diverse company. You are able to acquire training with every aspect of the business."
good,"Fun atmosphere, very fast paced on the weekends, great co workers. The management could use some change because most of them are lazy, and don't care."
good,a typical day is never typical there are always curve balls so thinking fast is important. I have learned so much working there about plumbing and ordering systems  .
good,"If you are looking for a long term career with advancement opportunities,  home depot is the way to go.They offer great benefits and a great bonus structure"
good,I worked at the east side Home Depot for a year and a half. They were always so kind and help til and we very flexible with me on my work days.  Overall I love working at the homedepot and highly recommend to people if you are friendly and level headed.
good,working at home depot is great. the team is great. its just that working overnight working at different stores. is hard driving an hour to one store one night then 2 hours to another store another night. its not that easy. but dont get me wrong the job is great. its the driving that will get you if your not used to it.
good,"great starting job...easy to get comfortable if you don't leave within a year. Good management and coworkers are trained to train you, you are trained to train new employees as well"
good,"Home Depot is a company that provides excellent advancement opportunity, fair compensation, and a fulfilling culture and family environment that would make anyone feel welcomed. For Home Depot is a company that I would feel comfortable spending many years with."
good,"It was fun working at Home Depot, people that I work with were really nice, helpful, cooperate, etc. I really like my manager , she was awesome, but unfortunately I could not work at night shift anymore so they could switched me to another shift because at the time there was not openings."
good,I loved working at Home Depot.  The people were like family and I was always moving.  My days seemed to fly by no matter what hours I was working at the time.
good,"Working at the Home Depot can be super relaxed, or challenging depending on you're attitude. The people working there are amazing and the culture at the store is nothing like I have ever experienced for work. The only reason I am looking for a new job is pay, and I'm looking for a job that I can advance in."
good,"This was my first employment at retail sales and planned to stay for several months.  But found that enjoyment equaled physical labor and stayed for 6+ years.  I felt that other associates looked to me for leadership, how to do the work correctly.  I found that these college kids were fun to be around.  My career was Physician Assistant with the federal government at the VA."
good,"A day at work: Expected to down stock products in a timely manner and help customers with whatever they needed."
good,"In Puerto Rico it was the best place, but in Lebanon the administration really does not know what they do, for the welfare of the employees and the store."
good,"You will constantly be learning. If you show initiative you will be quickly taught different departments and treated very very well. Relaxed, and very fair, you never have to look over your shoulder when working."
good,It's a good place to work if you want to just relax and do your job. Not many people come here compared to a grocery store and I don't have to make room for my other job with it.
good,"When I worked there, they offered education expense reimbursement.  That worked very well for me at the time.  Another good thing is they have very flexible hours for students."
good,"Great place to work for, with a lot of benefits if they are taken advantage of. Great management and tolerable associates. Competitive pay with people wiling to help you climb the ladder to success"
good,"In my job, I'm sales specialist at appliances and I have goals to myself to do good every day, that I can reach to my goals every week. I have plan to my goals."
good,"The company overall is great but it is very difficult and competitive to advance to a full time position.  The typical shift can range from four hours to about 9 hours. I learned many customer service skills, the company is very focused on the customer having the best experience possible."
good,"The store work environment is relaxed and task oriented. Management structure, expectations and daily task are clear. Support is offered to employees to address unexpected family crisis."
good,"Let your creativity shine."
good,The position is fast pace and attention to detail is imperative in this position. Your primary position is Chat but you are called to assist the Phone and SMS department if the queue is high.
good,"great management, great benefits, company takes care of their employees very well, quick-cased but also time to get things done, frequent celebrations"
good,"Working at the customer service desk; You have to be very patience , understanding, Quick and informative. I learned a lot customers can really be rude and you have to stuck it and help them best way you can with a very positive attitude . Their are many mangers but they all work as team which is great. The most enjoyable part is working with the service desk and other employees."
good,"The job was really fun to work at when I started, my day typically consisted of me just working carts of product to their home on the shelf. As time went on I was allowed more responsibilities, eventually being allowed to come in earlier than scheduled to help unload the truck and sort the freight, and stay past my schedule to close out the truck and check-in the freight."
good,"Aquí sí hay oportunidad de crecimiento, se descansa los domingos."
good,"Great atmosphere, friendly people, great benefits. Decent pay, opportunity to advance. Ft or pt available almost always, good management, feels like family"
good,"1. every day was relaxed unless you didn't understand what you were doing. "
good,a typical day at work is pretty easy and fun. as long as you always stay busy management won't bother you. a lot things you can learn with this company that will better you. recommended but not really if you tight on money
good,"acomodo de mercancía, riego de plantas, exhibición de plantas, inventario, servicio a cliente, pedido de plantas"
good,Just wish they would offer full time. Great place to work. Family oriented. One big family!!!! You get to know customers by name. And you can't help but bleed orange!!
good,I liked one store but not another.  One store had hostile rude managers that yelled at you.  The other was wonderful with managers that spoke kindly and were very interested in the store employees and store growth.
good,"Fun place to start as tech support, give you enough Training to answered all questions related to live job when you are on the cubicle, fun team to work on everyone is nice"
good,"managers pressed about sales but didnt even know the dept , kind of had to learn everything trial and error or call other stores for advice, training is all computer based"
good,Fair and fun work environment. Managers and Supervisors treat you with respect and the staff is super friendly. Sometimes we get pizza and BBQ hamburgers.
good,I worked there for 12 years and I loved it. I was immediately promoted to supervisor. Under most store managers you are given full latitude to run your operation as though it was Your own business.
good,"Home Depot provides many avenues of training, great weekly meetings, they have great managers who are willing to share information and experiences to enable you to advance in the company."
good,"I enjoy working at the Home Depot, I enjoy working with building materials and related items. "
good,it was good people to work for but it was over worked and under paid too much turn over in my department and good environment to be in and i like everyone and got along safe place to work for always people leaving in my department not fast replacement i tried to go to to change department
good,"Work was good, not stressful. Managers were always there to assist you in learning new things. I understand as a customer Service/Retail Center you may have to work an inconsistent schedule and working most weekends and holidays"
good,The Home Depot was a pretty cool place to work as long as you don't mess with any of the mangers time or standard operating procedures. The management team there lacked true leadership.
good,This Is a job for people who are retired and looking for something to do. It is not something young people should do. And the hours are up and down or you don't really get many.
good,"Good after school job, the people were friendly and very respectful towards the employees. I enjoyed the work I did I just could not continue because it affected my schooling."
good,home depot was a very great place to work. I learned a lot of great things I learned how to do the forklift and got certified for it I absolutely loved that the company had Christmas parties those were fun.
good,Home Depot was a stepping stone to a placement at another job for me. The people I worked with were great and I've stayed friends with a few over the last 10 years! The atmosphere is very relaxed with clear goals for each deparment.
good,"Heavy daily workloads with few hours to complete them, creating problems in a really good infrastructure. No full time was given for my department so we were expected to do full time work in half of the time. Great environment and a lot of great people to work with"
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot - meeting customers in the isle, and helping them find the products they need, and suggesting products for their project if they didn't know what exactly they needed."
good,"Everyone there is like family, but like many jobs, nepotism is always a problem. Most opportunities to advance are based solely on who you know. Also, I there were several occasions where salaried managers were hired from outside the company rather than giving hard working employees a chance to advance."
good,"I worked as a part-time Merchandising Execution Associate (MEA). A typical day for this position, was clock-in, meet with team lead and receive daily duties. After your duties were received you were on your own. If you like working independently, this would be the perfect job for you. Your responsibilities are to merchandise the assigned aisles by product which includes removing product that did not belong. Here and there management would come by and check on you to make sure you were doing great. The work place culture of Home Depot feels like a second family. Everyone at the Homewood, IL location where amazing people. The hardest part of the job, would be wanting more hours. If you are hired as a part-time MEA, you hardly get overtime. The most enjoyable part of working at Home Depot was building a lifetime relationship with my co-workers. I am no longer employed there and I still talk to my co-workers."

good,All of the associates at home Depot were very welcoming and friendly. My supervisor was especially helpful and kind toward me and my cousin workers. Commonly she would treat us to lunch or breakfast and also other supervisors would do this also for their branches of the store.

good,Management and coworkers are making people. The pay is not the best but the people make up for it. You get bigger annual bonus checks depending on the stores sales.
good,A typical day as a cashier was fun and competitive because we had to see who could get the most customers to sign up for the home depot credit card. I loved my job at home depot. I just didn't like that I had to leave due to differences with management when I was late because I had to take my child to the hospital and came in with paperwork stating I was at the hospital.
good,working at home depot was a fun job. everyone got along we all helped each other-management was very understanding to certain things.Since store managers have been moved around i wouldn't return.
good,Home Depot allows you to educate the consumer as well as other associates.  You have the ability to move up within the company at your on pace.  The benefits are great and the employees are great to work with at Home Depot.
good,"We had a quote and if you completed it, you go home. There was no rush, no managers hovering over your back. Just you and the product. Lots of leeway in what you could do on the job. Like plug an earphone into one ear over night. Just to have some stimulation."
good,From the time you clock in until the time you clock you are going to be working hard. You have to ensure that all tasks are completed efficiently without sacrificing the quality of the task itself. It is important to be able to multitask and to be able work on multiple projects/orders at once without forgetting anything or failing to complete a portion of any task.
good,"I learned so much in the 5 years I was there, back then all cashiers went to cashier college. Everyone was hired part time, and I was hired on full time in my first month...not a simple task.The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers that you get to know and help with their daily projects, as well as the employees become like family to you.The hardest part of the job is the summers can be very hot in the warehouse."

good,Home Depot is a stable company to work for. They give you alot of things to look forward to and reward you with different items  I would recomment the Home Depot to friends.
good,Home Depot is a good place to work.  The only draw back is you do not have a set schedule if you are a part time associate.  You could work nights one day then the next work early mornings
good,"My original location of work at this company was a great experience with tons of advancement opportunities and great people to work with. Every day was full of work and busy with customers. The management was great and willing to work with me even though at the time I had an hour and a half drive to and from work. I wish I hadn't transferred to a different location, it was a completely different experience and ultimately led to me leaving the company. It was not the company that was the problem, but the people at that specific location. The second location did not offer advancement and there was a lot of underhanded illegal activity that I did not want to be around. When nothing changed after reports were filed, I decided to leave and seek employment elsewhere."
good,This store location was shut down in the Greenville Area. I absolutely loved working for this company. The way they take care of their employees is the best I have ever seen!
good,I learned so many things since this was my first encounter with retail sales.  Learning the culture was fun.  I made to silver in no time once I became full time.  I really enjoyed my self.
good,"Great environment ,benefits are awesome  must take your schedule seriously their is definitely growth within the company , it all depends on you . their training is also pretty good ."
good,Cashing out customers as they leave the store. Also encouraging them to apply for credit cards. Talking with and getting to know customers is also very enjoyable.
good,"A typical day working as a sales associate revolves around customers and providing them with friendly and helpful service along with a clean and accessible shopping environment. I learned about the contracting business, paints, money handling and over all how to provide and cater to customers. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the intricacies of each department without actually being a trained professional or technician of any. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the customers. They relieve much of the stress and they're exceptionally understanding when there are any complications opposed to other retail stores that I am aware of. Working with kids and workshops also feel like days off from regular work days. The management there is very respectable and understanding. Employees with seniority and new hires all get the same compassion and empathy. They hire employees because they need them and want them. There is no termination without reason."
good,Good place to work as long as youre good with people(customers) who dont always know what they need or how to use it. Management is good. They work with any schedule you need
good,Help water plants and help clean up they store and load custmors and help anybody who need help and drive they forklift and reach truck to unload trucks and load trucks.

The culture is to be frendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working nights. i enjoyed helping  and working with good people."
good,Home Depot was a great place to work; it was fast paced and I always felt I had something to do. Sometimes the schedules aren't as flexible as needed for a students schedule.

good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for and they care about there associates. The company offers a vast majority of benefits and perks. Home Depot offers matching 401k , employee stock purchasing plans and so much more"
good,I enjoyed working at Home depot. What I like most was the responsibility I had and the skills I learned. I also loved interacting with my clients. I felt like I was most trusted in the role of Contract Services Cashier.
good,"a typical day starts with punching in and getting my apron on. walking down to the service desk for morning meeting if we have one, then I make my way to my department and checking each aisle for any safety concerns, after I complete the morning safety check list I check to price signs in the department, print new signs out if there is any. I then check to see if I have any note in the system, my other job duties include cleaning and dusting all appliances, the kitchen show room and sweeping to make the department look clean and organized, I then walk down every aisle to see if I need to down stalk any products on the shelf. I also have to check the service desk for any returns to bring back to the department. but one of the most important things is maintaining excellent customer service at ALL time......"
good,"Experience in customer service and cashiering. Worked with school schedule.work environment coworkers are friendly, helpful, and respectful. If I had any questions they would help me."
good,"I worked at the FP&A department handling the tons of data available at our disposal and using them to generate insights. I learned to use SAS and R, two languages that i had no idea of before i joined at this place.

good,management makes wrong decisions .work environment is pleasant and other associates as well. as in any other retail job it interferes with your personal life because of the different shifts
good,Ive been at the home depot for over 1 year now. I love working here they have really good benifit options. Co workers are easy to get a long with. Managers are fun and get a long with most people. Good pay and sometimes good hours.
good,"I enjoyed the time that I was at Home depot. I wish that there was more opportunities for advancement to either full time or to supervisor's role. I felt that the job requires everyone to do the supervisors job, but for part time pay and hours."
good,"They treated you well. We had many benefits and upper management rewarded us for our hard work..profit sharing, 401 k, and nice stock options.. Overall a great place to work"
good,I enjoy my time there good co-workers great management but just too few hours of work. that is the only real complaint I have otherwise it wasn't so bad especially overnight being able to just listen to music and just work. it was a relaxed and comfortable environment and would recommend someone there but only if you don't need to many hours because when it slows down you will go from 40 hours to 20 in nearly no time at all maybe 30 every now and again.
good,Home depot was a great place to work. I learned a lot about customer service and putting customers first. I also like it because it was an early morning position Monday-Friday.

good,I honestly enjoyed my time working here from my last teen year into my 20's. My store had  an excellent management team that made it feel like a family and not a mega brand store.
good,"The management is approachable and engages its employees on a personal as well as a business level. Frequent bbq's and festive activities based on different party themes where participation is encouraged. Customer service, satisfaction and building customer relations are the main focus."
good,"Great company to start off any career, and outstanding training. Hardest part about the job, is mostly because I was always under staff, and I was always over worked and little pay."
good,The Home Depot is perfect for those that enjoy retail settings from entry level jobs all the way to management. Almost anyone can get this job with or without experience and they are very understanding and lenient with their employees. You can also quickly have career advancements here if you really strive for it and work hard same for getting full time status and The Home Depot mostly promote within compared to hiring on managers. Having employees earn to get full time hours and plus there are many employees incentives you can get into. Overall I've really enjoyed working at The Home Depot so far and I would recommend anyone from those experienced in retail or those looking for a first time job.
good,"My day would consist of making my way upfront to find out where i would be located for the day. I would work in all areas of the store, but a great deal in the garden, so i learned a lot about the plants we sold. Management was really only around if you called for one of them and sometimes they wouldn't even come. The hardest part of the job is learning new things because i did not really know much about hardware and that was something i needed to know or working in the flooring department that was the hardest position most people would say is the hardest. My favorite part of my job were the people that i worked with they became like a second family."
good,"I came in at 9:00pm and would have a meeting with all of the night crew and we would go over what our plan was for that night. The supervisor and manager were very helpful and easy to deal with. My supervisor was one of the best bosses I've ever had. The job was not hard in any sense of the word, it was mind numbing from how simple it was."
good,The Home Depot is a great company to work for. They have great benefits. The work environment could improve. The management is very poor at the facility i work at 8616.

good,"Home Depot does alot for its employee's on a whole. They however lack in communication about employer position what is allowed. Jobs are specific, management lacks in direction, they are overstaffed  , yet are understaffed"
good,"Everyone there is helpful and supportive. On a typical day you are constantly moving, packing, unpacking, scanning etc. The culture is fun, a little corny with cheers every day but it works to get everyone energized. They have regular meetings, incentives, recognition and lunches provided for the employees. Hardest part of the job is working in the extreme heat during the summer months, the best part is working with such great people and the philanthropy."
good,"THD takes care of their employees, including those who work part-time. I've enjoyed working there and will continue to do so as long as I can. I have a great relationship with management and the other associates."

Monthly training is provided so you are constantly learning,  Management is great!  They are always willing to work with you and answer questions.  There is really nothing hard about this job.  The most enjoyable part of this job for me is working in the garden center especially in the spring and summer.  Its very busy and I enjoy being outside."
good,"For the retail portion of my work the analytical exposure to such a successfully run public company can only open the eyes for those who look. From the statement goal to shareholders to the year to date report efficiency in addition to the proffit and loss reflections all leading to game plans oil this meticulous clock thats hands revolve door of high foot traffic, promissed average ticket sales, yet what remains as the biggest secrect takeaway is that it all revolves around a smile as well as servitude. "

I had the privilege to be a part of a couple of committees while I was there, like kids program and the employee event committee. love them both. I still visit there on regular.

They are understanding whenever something important/immediate comes up in your personal life and will do whatever they can to help you juggle both your personal life and professional life - no this does not apply to your social life of drinking, but it does to the important things like family."
good,"I would go in and log into my computer and help the next customer or follow up with my day before customer order, pull there order verified we had all the items. call customer with estamated time for the delivery to arive.I Learn alot of all the departments.the management wasn't all good there was alot of favortisim and who ever managers liked they would get a good reward and position and week schedule.

Teammates are easy to get a long with, and management is reasonable, helpful, and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is stacking, lifting 100 lbs bags of material.

good,"Great for part-time extra income and exercise (depending on your position). I looked at it like being paid to exercise and talk to a diverse crowd of customers. Great feeling to work a 4 to 8 hour shift and be physically drained afterwards from walking, lifting and being engaged constantly. While the pay may be low, what do you expect from retail unless you are in upper management? Great as a 2nd job, especially if you are rooted to a chair 8 hours a day in another position. Benefits, especially the retirement plan and stock purchase plan can really start to add up after several years. If you are close to retirement or retired and need to get out and about and earn some grocery money I'd say go for it."

good,They are great with working with you on scheduling and allowing you to have a life outside of work. The management at the store is great
good,"A typical day would be getting in at nighttime around 8pm and helping customers find what they need; afterwards the grave shift would start, where me and a bunch of other big guys would set the store up for the following day as a well oiled machine. None of us could slack, and any internal disputes by strong personalities would have to be dealt with quickly. Being a rock that is able to understand the value of teamwork and have a strong work ethic was key. I enjoyed getting to know customers and learning about what they wanted to do for projects. I also came accustomed to the routine of working there."
good,The Home Depot is a very enjoyable place to work. The associates are appreciated within the company. Work  assignments are clear and concise along with job expectations.

The main manager will not even take his phone calls he makes everyone take a message or he sends it to other managers. While on the floor you do not stop always moving and doing something.

good,"I Have nothing but great things to say about this company.  I moved up rather quickly, and the company does a great job recognizing talent.  The only obstacle you will run into in certain markets is being able to take the next step in your career. there just isn't enough turn over in smaller markets to advance.  You will have to move to a larger market and try to move up that way.  Other than that it's a top notch company.  Every day is different, and the company practices what they preach."

good,Overall Home Depot was a great place to work. The most difficult aspect of my job was the traveling from store to store. The most enjoyable aspect of my job was motivating employee's to take owner ship and I enjoyed train both managers and employees alike. I enjoyed interaction with customers and problem solving.

I love working with my co-workers, it makes the environment so much easier to work in. I must say the hardest part of my job are dealing with mean and nasty customers, however; the part I enjoy most are the customers, because its always something new, and something to learn. I love it."

good,Nice place to work and had a lot of good times with my team members.  But bottom line this was still retail and all that goes with that.
good,"Everyday as an associate you have 4 hours from open to pack down and fill your holes. Then its a switch to 100% customer service. Management is helpful in all aspects. Especially if you're looking to grow inside the company. Often tedious to negotiate pay increases as it directly effects managements bonuses, but can be done with the right approach. Hardest part of the day for most is to be able to recognize that angry customers are usually not angry with them but some other and unrelated aspect of their lives. Don't take it personal. Just sympathize and help."
good,Working for the home depot was very challenging in that It required vast product knowledge about a lot products in all departments. To meet this end there were Pk's throughout the week. After working at the Melbourne store for 2yrs I was selected to transfer to the new Palm Bay store that was still being built. It was very instructural about how these store are built from the ground up. The teamwork required for this was one of the main reasons I was selected for this position. The days were long and hard with a deadline fast approaching and this helped really pulled our team together. It was almost a letdown when the job was finished and the team was transferred back to there original stores.

good,"A typical day at THD can vary on so many levels, for the most part it's and enjoyable work environment. The associates for the most part are your teachers in everything you begin to know about your department and the store. Time passes and you build relations with DIY and PRO customers and teach as much as learn something new everyday from both of them. Hardest part of the job is working under pressure when the department or store is understaffed and or dealing with irate customers. Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing by the end of the day i have helped people and sent them home on their way to tackle a job that they can get done by themselves. Also along with working with amazing Pro Contractors that you build an amazing customer relationship with."
good,A variety of skills can be learned here and the staff are a joy to work with. The customers keep you on your toes as there are many different home projects to be done.

good,"I learned a lot at home depot. I learned how to deal with customers and their needs, how to look ahead and make sure they had everything they needed for the whole project and I learned how to sell a project. I also learned a lot about tools and new products it was a rewarding experience"
good,"finding out where I will be station at because it always changing I enjoy all the head cashier, trying to satisfy Every customers"
good,"I was hired same day as my interview, and was told of the many opportunities for me to become a permanent employee. Just as I was getting a hang of my job my seasonal position was cut a week short and they were dropping people like flies and keeping the ones that I outworked, as a rookie. once they become comfortable with their circle of workers they keep it and it only. it was a huge blow for me financially and resulted in the loss of a car and apartment."

good,I loved working with my customers and making personal connections with them.  Helping solve problems.  I also managed up to 20 associates.
good,I began working for The Home Depot back in 2006 as a part-time cashier.  One year later I was promoted to part-time head cashier.  I worked for The Home Depot as a head cahier for almost four years.  That following year I was asked to re-locate to Baytown as a front-end supervisor.  I took the offer b/c the pay went up a few dollars an hour and offered full-time at that.  I absolutely loved working for The Home Depot b/c the company always seemed to work with each employee on flexibility.  I later decided to stay at home full time with my now two year old twin daughters.  I now am a full time student and getting my license to become a Radiologic Technologist.  I start my externship in under two weeks.
good,Home Depot provides a great team environment and training.  The atmosphere is positive and people work together.  There is alot of opportunity.  The hardest part is you cannot work over 20 - 25 hours.
good,"I always have a great relationship with the people I work with. If they needed help, I was always there, if they needed a laugh, I gave it."
good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work.  The company is great with making each associate feel as if they are family, rather than just an employee.  Management arranges fun things for the associates such as cookouts or other types of celebrations.  There is no way to be bored in an establishment like this, there is always something happening."
good,"Great place to work friendly people with love for one another, the only thing is I just graduated college and felt that it was time for a full time job."
good,"Typically my day starts with walking my department, looking for product outs , and making sure all customers are serviced. I then proceed to my desk and check on any existing orders that need to be followed up. I learn something new everyday working at Home Depot. whenever i have a problem i try my best to solve it on my own, if not then i take the problem up with management. My coworkers and i all work as a team when it comes to customer service, orders, stocking, etc. I believe the hardest part of my job would be when issues go wrong with important orders. I work hard and try to fix the problem as soon as possible. I enjoy every day at my job, I love being able to make my customers smile, and help them."
good,Pretty good company. They train their staff and equipment them with a decent amount of info to have an understand proper application to give advice. Many of the staff have their own prior knowledge which they bring to the table.
good,i love my job at The Home Depot. There are great people who are willing to no only work with but teach you everything you need to know.
good,I loved working at the home depot.I l learned how to be a sales associate.I worked with good people and good management.A typical day at work was helping people.
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I loved the management and the people I worked with. I got to receive more hours and gain experience with warehouse equipment. The management was understanding and really worked with me, which we good because it was a second job for me at the time."
good,"Great place to work, fun and safe, one of the best jobs I had. The only down fall is the massive cut in hours that is forces me to find a new, this is something I don't want to do but it seems I have to,or I will lose everything I own."
good,"Poor pay for hard, physical work. Company policy of ""keep isles clear of obstructions"" is violated by projects, and corporate greed by placement of product in isles to ""drive sales"". Night management must call every hour for lights to be turned on so team members can work. The ""Homer Fund"" to assist associates in financial need is a good idea; however, employees put money into the fund, and when it's needed, employees must put money into it again. If the amount is enough, Corporate releases double the amount...from the account associates already paid into"
good,"As someone who has worked many customer service oriented jobs in the past, I find that Home Depot was my favourite customer service job thus far. Associates are hired in at more than minimum wage by a few cents, and each year receive a monetary raise - usually .25c. The employees are friendly and great to talk to. Interaction with [some] customers is great. Management is very approachable, although, sometimes when you need them they are either in a meeting or behind closed doors. For the labour-work required at Home Depot, I think the employees should be getting paid more than minimum wage - more than is already paid. For example, the Lot Associates, Garden Centre Associates, and most Department Associates deal with a lot of heavy lifting in order to help customers to ensure they are getting what they need. A computer-based program organizes the schedules for each associate, and is presented online for associates to view 3 weeks in advance. Associates are also able to book off days they need through an online portal. The only downside of booking days off is that the system that controls the schedules tends to cut your hours. For example, a part time associate will work between 30-38 hours a week. If they book off a day or two, their hours for a week could go down to 28-30 hours.

good,"I started at the Joplin Mo Home Depot as a lot attendant but moved up to delivery puller after three months of working hard and doing a good job. The management was very cool as long as you worked hard. I started off at $7.35/hr. but moved up to $9.25 after switching to delivery puller. I decided to transfer to California after one year which was a big mistake. The Turlock CA store was horrible. The HR lady was very rude and forgetful. Needless to say my opinion went down hill after a short stint with this store. A typical day at the Joplin store was, show up at 4 am print a pick list, pull and palletize out going delivery in a hour or two, take a break, help the lumber recovery person until lunch, then started POWER HOUR where your not allowed to task only help customers. I had the best co workers at the pro desk, everyone worked to help each other with an exception of a few lazy co workers. The hardest part of the job is listening to customers talk down on you for other peoples mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job was by far the associates I worked with on the daily routine. The Home Depot also rewards the hard working associates with homer awards every third homer you get extra $$$ on your check. I also received a customer service super star award worth $250. So all in all it can be a good place to work with all the extras i.e. Rewards program, Rx, health, dental, 401k, and profit sharing."

I have how to be a courageous leader and to be a servant leader.  the hardest part of my job is the lack of work/life balance.  The most enjoyable part is my associates; without them we do not have a business."
good,"Working here taught me how to take inventory, monitor product in our department, and demostrate excellent customer service."
good,"Home Depot starts most employees at 9.00 an hour, There are few ways to climb the ladder (so to speak)."
good,Its a wonderful place to get involved in if your the type of person who likes to work with people. Its an equal place of employment and the managers there are all fair to their employees. They can help you to get to your desired position and help you to reach where it is that you see yourself
good,Nothing really to complain about besides the need to hire better and knowledgeable managers.  Associates can learn from hands on training as well as computer.

good,"Home Depot has given me an amazing job, best I have ever had. Employees are friendly and we have event like success sharing and christmas party. However as a cashier it is very hard to move to a different department you have applied for within the store. they also pay well for a part time job. They have also thought me how to do returns so I have become more patient with customers."
good,The environment at the Home Depot is very amicable and respecting.

good,I learned how to provide great customer service and always tool rental an excellent cashiers and refunds associate. my co-worker are great and the management is o.k not the best but them will do for the moment my only problem is the pay not supporting my family because the home depot always cut hours. There is no hard part of the job if u learning from the training they provide its a piece of cake
good,Maintain a possitive attitude. Hard worker. Fast learner. Team leader Well Organized. Material Handling
good,"Everyday im counting product, label changing, customer service, pulling orders, scanning out of stock product, stocking shelves and help in all departments. Ive learned a lot about how inventory in a company works, for example how loses occur, how money is lost and how the ordering process works. My management is pretty decent there not to on your back they let you do what you need to do without a lot of hassle, their easy to work with and their understanding. The hardest part of my job is having so much to do in only four hours a day. Its demanding and fast but the best part is the schedule and that its so fast paced the time flies by ."
good,"From the time you punch in till the time you punch out it is filled with energetic people.Associates are always smiling looking for customers to talk to about the projects that they are working on.You are able to deal with the public and help beautify the community.I learned how to use all the machines and become a fork lift trainer to the rest of the associates.Everyone treats you as if you are part of the team and make you feel wanted ,needed and special.I dont think there was anything that was hard to do.The depot provided training for everything that was expected of you.the most enjoyable part of my day at the depot was working with the casselberry parks and applying for grants from Atlanta.Being able to tell the city of casselberry I have 3,000.00,and im going to make your parks beautiful.I loved the finished projects.I liked to see the faces and emotions when it was all done.There is so much to learn and the oppertunity is all there for the taking.The perks were a matching 401 k.medical,dental,vision.Paid sick time and vacation.every six months was bonus time.The raises were ok, once a year .I worked Monday through Friday.I loved haveing a set schedule.I also liked dealing with the contractors,helping them get the supplies that they needed to complete the job.Not to mention they would bring in pictures.Amazing what people can do with some wood and nails."

good,"A day at work at Home Depot is exciting. Working at the Customer Service desk, I always get to help people with returns, guide them to find the merchandise they need, and help them purchase the items needed for a home project or major renovation. Management is very caring and very dedicated. The only thing that is hard about my job is the unstable schedule. It is never a set schedule so making plans with my family gets tough sometimes. I really enjoy my co-workers, and the customers I have grown to know."
good,Fast paced customer service along with daily activities keep you occupied the whole day. Sometimes you forget that you have to stop and take a lunch or get ready to go home for the day. We have access to tons of online training that is available immediatley. Asscociates are like family at this job. We have luncheons that help benefit other associates that might need a helping hand or have been out for medical reasons. The best is when a customer comes in with some pictures showing you the finished product of something you helped them organized and held workshops to show them how to get started and get it done themselves. The hardest part of the job has to be when customers have to leave the area to move for either job reasons or family and you have built a relationship with them.
good,"Fast pace, progressive company to work. Big supporter of diversity issues and local community."

Keeping in touch with management on product display, the hardest part of the job was having the items the customer needed for his project. The most enjoyable part was the satifaction of the customer when it all came togher and the returned to the store to thank you for your help and share pics of the completed project."
good,"Great culture, people, and opportunity for growth."
good,"Working for Home Depot was a great experience because it was there I was first able to use a forklift, walkie, and reach truck. Management was great however the pay was quite low. I felt like i belonged to a team and i was able to develop friendships with my co-workers"
good,There is always positive people there that do not discriminate on there employees nor customers. Managers are very helpful and understanding. Ive learned not to hold back if you want something go for it.

Depending on what store your working for the managers can either work with you or against you. They have way to many managers that will pull u away from a task to accomplish one of their own objectives. After awhile you'll get used to it."
good,always something to do never boring

good,"Management is good, you can talk to them about anything. If you need help at work with something such as product knowledge or you have concerns about your home life and need help they are there for you.

good,"overall great place to work, fun, hands on and great learning experiences."
good,"I learned alot working at Home Depot. This was a very fast pace company which made the day go by quickly. I enjoyed pallet building and learning all the new systems that were being brought in. Home Depot was a really good, strong company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be assisting customers, packing down merchandise, build displays, and drop paletized merchandise. I become knowledgeable about the products I work with and am able to sell products to my customers and leave them satisfied. My managers are very respectful and I couldn't have asked for a better environment to work in. The people and co-workers are kind and they are interested in the same things that I am. The hardest part of my job would be preparing for big walks and the most enjoyable part of the job would be personal knowledgment and praise after knowing i did a good job."
good,Awesome team support from staff
good,there are great advancement chances within this company. i would work here again. Also pays better than most other retail stores.
good,Good benefits 401 k match program always room for improvement
good,"customer service, answering phone, assisting customer, ordering special order, etc"
good,"You will learn about contractors, products and how they work. Co workers help you that have been there for years. A typical day is getting to work and making sure everything is neat and clean and then its the paper work of what needs to be delivered and picked up if any. Other than that assisting with customers that need a specific item."
good,"I learned on a daily basis to teach, listen and respect other employees. Learning from management on a daily basis was extremely promoted. Teaching, listening, and respecting others as a part of everyday values."
good,"I work an early shift from 5am till 9-10am depending upon the work load. I have learned a lot about the operation of Home Depot due to the fact that I have worked in the Freight and Inventory Management departments thus far. Some of my co-workers are reliable, but I find that the hardest part of my job is to complete everything in a timely manner under time constraints. I enjoy learning new things about the business of Home Depot and how it manages to work well off of its foundation and beliefs."
good,"Every day at work differed from the previous day. I learned so many things about so many products and installations! The management was mostly comprised of great people! My co-workers were were incredible, as well as competitive! The hardest part of the job was moving a refrigerator out of the overhead. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers!"

good,"I have to admit that this was the funnest job I had. The associates are always teaching you things. The company ensures that you are trained, compensated and promoted. The store managers really are in touch with their stores and they accept feedback. The hardest part of the job was the cut-throat competiton to be a store manager. the most enjoyable was making the sale to the customer and delivering awesome customer service."
good,"I would greet contractors process their orders and take request for special order products , follow up on requests from contractors and process orders to delivery of product. I operate a cash system/register and account numbers.. process Purchase orders ."
good,Great job and a great place to work. I learned multiple management skills and most importantly I learned team work traits that will be very valuable in future employement.
good,"A typical day at The Home Depot revolved around making sure customers were satisfied from the moment they walked in the door to when they checked out. As a cashier, most times, I was the one to greet most customers entering the building and the last impression customers got before they left. The biggest things I learned from this position were the difference between good customer service and going above and beyond for the customers sake, how to work well with a group of diverse individuals, and I now know it is important in a business such as Home Depot to be aware of each job in the store so that if a customer needed my assistance, I knew exactly how to help them no matter which department it was in."
good,"Fast Paced, hard work but fun and environment. Friendly co-workers and management"
good,"If you like a fast paced environment and many chances to advance and building relationships. It is a great place to work. In my personal experience it can be a learning environment to those of whom need experience. They advance those whom they believe are capable but not necessarily honorable. Management continually say! Do what I say, and not what I do. We as leaders need to lead by example.They do not always practice what they preach. I feel management do not always judge fairly because of political rights and correctness, instead of ethical stances. Favortism is rampart throughout many stores and facts actually ignored at store level."
good,Team work
good,Very professional workplace.
good,Great company with a lot of growth oppertunity but work/home balance not as important.
good,Professional Atmosphere

good,My typical day at work is walk the department make a plan of what I have to get done for that day. Work on my paperwork and help customers. I have learned to manage my people and deligate with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is leaving because I take pride in my work I dont leave untill is finished. The most enjoyable part of my job is helpig the customers and being able to make my ideas come to life
good,I learned a lot while I worked here. I gain a lot of knowledge in many different aspects of the company. The down side is that with as much as I knew and skills that I had. It wasn't till I was leaving did they try to promote me. But instead of promoting me I trained 4 of my bosses.
good,"One of the best places I've worked with one exception; over the last several years you are hired on as a part-time employee with little to no chance of becoming full time. Great working conditions , recognized for quality of work each month , managemant easy to get along with."
good,Typical day conssists of myself clocking in to the time clock and heading to the front cashier to get the position and place working today. I am then given goals for the day and suggested ways to complete goals. I have learned how to approach customers in unsure stages of each order. I don't find my job difficult the most enjoyable thing about my job is working in a diverse atmosphere with diverse customers.

good, Supervise 16 Associates in the Flooring and Decor Department
good,"The main focus on a daily basis is customer serice, and to increase sales productivity while keeping payroll and markdowns low. Management is consistently evolving in all aspects. My coworkers for the most part both seasoned and new work as a team. The hardest part of my job is to achieve the goals of both the store and my department. The demographics of the store and the present economy create challenges on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging and creating a personal repore with my clients, being part of a team, and interacting with my fellow associates."

good,Good to have work experience in The Home Depot.
good,"keep your opinions positive, report anything negative, and you should be covered! try to stay busy by maintaining the aisles and helping the customers and your day will fly by with ease"
good,"All in all working for this company was a great opportunity to learn and maintain much more than my job position, I've learned great tips in lessons in home improvement such as laying tile, the proper to apply fertilizer and grass seeds and few electric troubleshooting pointers so even though I'm no longer with the company i still carry some of the core values I've been taught, for example, putting customers first"
good,"the Home Depot is a great company to work for, If you dont mind working on weekends and on holidays, if you love to talk to and help customer this is the job for you.for the older person it is very demanding on the body, Advancement takes alot of hard work but it's possible."

good,"Home Depot is a great job if you're a working student, since the hours are flexible (mostly) and you get health benefits from working there. It's not much, but for anyone looking for an in-between job or some extra cash, this is the perfect fit!"
good,"When I am working at the Home depot, my days are always busy, and I love it. Everyday I learn something new and try to provide excellent customer service."
good,"Its a company that has the opportunity to make it a career, It is a great place to learn and advance withing the company. The work environment is very good and employees are very welcoming to the company. Lots of team work."
good,"Night MET is the job to have especially if the MET team gets to go to several different locations each week. One of the most laid back, fun, and most rewarding jobs. Feel accomplished each night as you complete your tasks and get to see the results before you go home. Anything from just putting a new product on the shelf to tearing out shelving."
good,"My time at Home Depot was short yet fun, we stayed at task and helped the customer with any problems finding products or help with cutting wood, we restocked our portion of the store and when the job was done, there was some leisure time to get to know each co worker, the actual work can be a bit tedious at times but there’s always something to keep you occupied."
good,"I enjoyed working at Home Depot! If only it was easier to get full time, I would have stayed! Great company and place to work at. The workplace culture was great and Home Depot showed that they cared not only about the customers but the employees as well! I would recommend this job."

good,"Clock in then head to the paint department, while there you would do one of several tasks. Anywhere from; mixing and matching paint, to straightening aisles, learning about new products to ensure you have the best information for the customers."
good,Hard working place that's always busy and the service there is great when the attendants are able to get the job done for the customers. Make sure that the customers are satisfied with their results so that they can leave out with a smile.
good,"Great working environment. I feel really supported by management. My coworkers are supportive. Training is provided but the quantity varies by location and department. You have ready access to contractors and a pool of knowledge and experience all around but the pay is always near minimum wage. So you end up working a lot more than what you would like. Also, scheduling tends to leave you alone for extended periods of time in which you are expected to service the customer, process returned merchandise, downstock product and clean up and organize the department along with being a knowledgeable associate."
good,Good place to work with potential for advancement. they have different departments for you to work in so you never get bored. They are willing to train you properly on the job.
good,"I loved working for Home Depot, I felt like I belonged to the team. I had no knowledge of the department I started in and everybody helped no matter how many times I asked for help. I think they should pay more, othere than that excellent company."
good,"Home depot is a great and exiting company to work with and have a lot  of opportunities for career growth. Plus, its like having a second family to build a bond with and create memories."
good,"I would certainly recommend this job for anyone looking for something to do after retirement from any skilled trade, as well as any individual looking to put in some effort to learn about home improvements. The work culture is 9/10 times great as even years after leaving previous co-workers still keep in touch, and most management staff are reliable and upfront compatriots in helping to get you settled in. The hardest part of the job is during slow season finding extra things to keep busy with, and the most enjoyable would have to be the opportunity for advancement within the company."
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are good . You can grow with home depot even if you never worked in a hardware store. 401 is good .I had to take a loan out
good,Easy going and very diverse working environment. Great safety and training programs. Nice and friendly management. The Home Depot is a good company for someone who just wants something small and steady paced.
good,"Great place to start working, You just have to be energetic and ready to work and you’ll be perfectly fine! They have various shifts. Overall the place is great."
good,"paint sales and service ,use paint machines to create the color paint customer request, service the machines we use for tinting,engage customers in type of paint and projects they are using it for."

good,"Home Depot is great company with plenty of growth for a driven individual.  Home Depot provides a family-like team, with the best benefits, and competitive pay."
good,"Working at Home Depot has been my first work experience, very grateful for the opportunity to learn, work and grow with the company."
good,The Hone Depot has never been my first choice of places to work. After experiencing it though I would go back in a heartbeat. I am in no way interested in anything the Home Depot sells however this was one of the healthiest work places I was in. Management often brought treats for the entire staff and would supply slushies almost every sunday. At the Home Depot I felt valued as a worker and that showed because every manager would always wave or say hello if they walked past you and they would help their teams I with customers if they were short staffed. This was a true collective team effort.
good,"After hearing so many first job horror stories, i was relieved to get this as my first job right out of high school. Went to college in the fall full time and was a participant in college marching band. Home Depot was incredibly flexible and allowed me to prioritize school. Also really pushed my development as a whole"
good,"Great place to work and meet new people and advance. This company really cares about their employees. Pay could be more when your starting from the bottom as a reg associate. Most Home Depots start off at $10/$11 an hr.  Other than that, I love my job!"
good,"Working at Home Depot was really good, but they could only offer part time work.  The supervisors were nice and there was a real feel of team work. I did learn how important this is, working with a team, in that it made the work hours go a lot more smooth."
good,the home depot is great from the customers to the employees everyone there is a team player and captain. a typical work day consists of helping customers find what they need quickly also providing great customer service and product knowledge
good,I liked working where i had experience. It was a easy place to work and the co-workers were helpful and nice. They were helpful in places i didnt have experience in.
good,"Excellent training,  sometimes stressful but great teammates and everyone pulls together to help.  High turnover rate, alot of initial job applicants who move on after training. Compensation could be a little better.  HR works with you just as management to assist your requests."
good,"Great company. "
good,"Home Depot is an excellent place to work at, people there are truly team-oriented, just not fairly compensated for tasks at hand. I have learned a tremendous amount at the Home Depot from learning about paints and stains and different tools and equipment."
good,"It was okay, almost never had any bad customers. had some great coworkers. Supervisors had their favorites. the hours where good not going to lie. :)."
good,At home depot there is always something to do. The break room is stocked with plenty of things to choose from and the management is always giving back
good,I LOVED working for Home Depot except for the pay... Cant support yourself on such a pittance living in our area. They used to pay better...not sure why they would lower their pay scale.
good,Es muy buena compañia y sus beneficios y paga de primera. El unico problema es que si eres Part time las horas hay sus semanas buenas y pal tiempo folojo te pueden dar hasta 4 horas semanal. De hay enfuera no tengo ninguna queja.
good,Worked  as  a  cashier.   Pretty  easy  other  than  the  customers.   Great benefits.   Overall  I enjoyed  working here and didnt have any problems.
good,"The best part of working at the home depot was getting involved with the Orange Door program."

good,Home Depot has been one of the best companies I have ever worked for. Their pay wage is fair and consistent with the work. they promote growth to succeed within the company.
good,Fun and Energetic environment- Love the empowerment the company enables with the managers and front line associates. The ability to learn and grow is the best Home Depot offers.
good,The work environment was very great and welcoming. The only complaint i would have is about the ASM he was fairly new and young but he had favorites. He would consistently ask part-timers for a decision that he should make.
good,I loved working here they taught me what I know today. I worked there 4 years I loved it part time but it was the best! Would definitely recommend working here.
good,Overall a great positive caring enviroment where hard work is appreciated and recognized. Lotts of opportunities for advancement amd learning indifferent departments.
good,"Great company, great  benefits and awesome people. I've been working here for about 12 years and honestly what's kept me here are the people. There are many opportunities to advance just have to be willing to work well with others as a team."
good,"As a MEA, the job is fast paced and changes daily. I found it interesting and challenging. I learned a lot from the experience. I enjoyed the team environment, and the work was physical but good."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the customers are really cool also the work at home Depot isnt hard to understand. But although I think I freight team should be paid a bit more for all the hard work
good,Good Company to work for. Management treated us well. Hours were perfectly suited for second part time job. Ability to move up. Managers office was always open
good,Typical day involves stocking plants and other merchandise throughout the day while assisting customers in product selection and growing methods. Relaxed and fun.
good,"Good job"
good,"The hourly rate of pay may not be all that great, but the benefits are awesome, even a part-time we can vision and dental 401(k) and stock purchase plan."
good,Lost my job due to another employee telling hr I was arrested if that haven’t happened I’d still have a job HR sides with manager when doing investigations and some of the managers are very unprofessional but working on the met tram gives you the advantages in the store and you get a consistent 40 hours a week you come in at 5am shift ends at 2pm
good,Great family like culture. Made many friends. Overall feeling of caring from management. Help available to associates struggling financially. Not enough hours though. Too many part time positions not enough full time.
good,It was always a fun place to work. If you worked hard you were recognized. Hours were flexable. Managment was supportive. Pay could have been better. Overall a great place to work.
good,it's a great place to work. some of the locations differ from others though. all in all I would recommend anyone to apply if they ever had the chance to
good,"Job is really good with benefits and profit sharing,only drawback is the pushing of the survey and credit cards."
good,"Good place to learn, the hours as a associates are diferente and not good for social life, management is a little bit informal and lack of fairness, associates do whatever they want do to supervision of the department head or managers on duty."
good,"Sustainable development emerged as a concept in the early sixties when the ruthless industrialization in the developed countries started showing visible signs of natural degradation and problems of pollution and ill health. Sustainable development became a wholesome word after the Brundtland Commission Report of 1987. It has three fundamental principles of inter-generational equity and justice, intra-generational equity and justice and that of the respect for the carrying capacity of land. Since the definition given by the report fails to define the processes underlying the complexities and contradictions within which international decisions are taken, the industrialized and the less-industrialized countries have defined the term to suit their own requirements. However there is a basic value inherent in this concept which everyone agrees to and that is the respect for human needs only in relation to the environmental capability to support the largest number of people to the longest possible time frame."
good,"Every day is different at THD and I learn new things at least weekly. "
good,This is likly the best job I have ever had very supportive company. Hours are up and down but lots of room for improvement. Train to learn things is always available. Very happy to be working for Home Depot.
good,Too many Young Supervisors that don`t know what they are doing & don`t know how to communicate effectively because they don`t have basic communiacation skills to begin with. Life experience is what goes a long way. Or you have an Associate that becomes a Supervisor & instantly become unbearable because they are now Full of themselves. Upper Management won`t take care of it because now they are stuck with them. This Company was built on experience & Great customer service. Most associates are kind & great. Then you have your few bad apples that make it difficult to want to come to work.
good,"Good opportunity to work with kind customers and employees. It was a small store that I worked in so the environment was nice and felt inclusive. Although the pay was low compared to other comparative stores, they did provide opportunities for learning and cared about their employees and customers."
good,I’ve been working here for 4 years! The company is great and cares about their associates! I love that everyone is so welcoming to each other! Definitely a great place to work!
good,"This job to me seemed very laid back because after I was trained I was pretty much left on my own. There was no micro-managing involved but I personally like that about the job."
good,I have been working at The Home Depot for about three months and I have to say that it is a good job and they respect people there well and I have learned a lot there.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. Great company culture and wonderful people. It is also quite competitive, so if you're looking to work there, be ready for a challenge."
good,Even though we had a lot of fun on the floor we still did our jobs and accomplished all of our check list. At the end of the day everyone was still happy and eager for the next day.
good,"Es la mejor empresa en la que he trabajado sin duda alguna, volvería si tuviera oportunidad dure poco por que el único contra que tiene es que se meten mucho en tu vida personal, que si con quien andas o con quien platicas o que haces en tu tiempo libre.. fuera de eso EXCELENTE!!"
good,"A lot of hard working people in Home Depot, everyone works hard and as a group! Home Depot helps the community and it’s employees! Very thankful! TEAM HOME DEPOT!!!"
good,"Very nice scheduler, work life balance terrific. Manager very helpful. Fellow employees friendly. The facility was close to my home. Very happy with the training received. Garden reps pleasant to work with."
good,"good job for students, mothers looking for work and retirees, second job. flexible schedule, good work environment, room to make overtime, ability to cross-train in all department"
good,"Good place to work. would suggest for anyone seeking flexible hours, career advancement, and good organizational skills. Sometimes fast paced (as a cashier on Sundays for example) sometimes slow."
good,"Great place to work while going to school, their very flexible with any schedule and they care about all associates. Great coworkers and management. Definitely recommended."
good,"I started with this company in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania then move back to Mississippi Jackson throughout my four and a half years I started off in the parking lot and ended up in loss prevention after taken a role as garden supervisor, overnight freight supervisor, and acting manager on duty also a roll at the service desk"
good,"Retail life is fast paced and can be stressful at times. I learned face to face customer service skills, I also improved and built upon my knowledge of home improvement projects."
good,"You have a very flexible work schedule where you can get as little as twenty hours depending on what you are looking for. The job depends upon your ability to communicate well with other customers, but that can sometimes be easier said than done. All in all you at least have the support of your teammates, managers have a whole other thing going on."
good,"Great place to start or finish a career in retail. Great benefits and relaxed atmosphere. Also great for temporary work and seasonal employment. Great knowledge for the housing industry "
good,"Overall decent job, can get stressful a lot by lack of staff and or upset customer blowing things out of proportion. Management is great no complaints. Pay is decent but not equivalent to the work we do for the company"
good,I always would make sure that my daily routine was completed in a timely manner. I would always make sure the customer left with the feeling that they had the best experience that they could ever have with a salesperson.
good,Despite the legal drama I'm going through it was a pretty great company they stand for their values an etc some people don't follow protocol but that's those people
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Home Depot."
good,"I throughly enjoyed working at home depot.  I could work for home depot again, however , it would have to be in a management position. Management is where you can be best compensated for your time and effort!!!"
good,"I absolutely loved my job at The Home Depot. I found myself wanting to advance in the company, but unfortunately most people there do as well so it is very competitive. I worked as a cashier for a long time until I finally got bumped up to the Tool Rental Department which came with a small raise. Lots of fun, always having BBQ's or catering, employees are all close."
good,it was a cool place to work at mostly because its about customer servicing all the time the team was more like familyi would  love to work for the home depot but its not the job for me
good,"Employees treated impeccably by management."
good,great place to work. You learn many things about how to repair homes and build stuff. the management works with you to ensure you have all of the tools to do your job.
good,Easy and good work flow. Always have work no getting off early for lack of work. Just a great place to work for with a open door policy when you have a problem
good,The job was a good experience  I learned lots of important things from learning how to use tool and learning how things work and how to build things. !
good,there's a lot of hardwork involved with home depot warehouse but the benefits and the steady hours are really nothing to complain about. pretty good job overall
good,"A lot of opportunity, challenges, and customer service. Delivery for transfers to control the business outs, and the benefits are fair. Waiting period to grow in the company can take a while but worth it for you want to move up."
good,"The Home Depot is an excellent place to work - though a little below on pay. But the company and culture really promotes a very good value system, and senior management really stands behind it."
good,Good place to work the people are great. The only reason why I left is because it's hard for me to find a good balance between work and school and everyday social events
good,"A typical workday in Home depot is like on a Tuesday whereby the whole front end is filled with consumers coming in the store or checking out. The service desk associates are consistently paying attention to customers and their different needs. The hardest part of the service desk is when managing a long line of customers with needs that will take a long time before satisfying them."
good,"It is really funny to work at The Home Depot. The associates are friendly (not all) but the majority. I have learned a lot things because Home Deport gives the opportunity to study; associates take class every month and learn more. My supervisor is a really good person; she helps a lot to everybody. The manager is friendly and a good guy. He works hard all the time. I feel pretty well working at HD. The Human Resource Manager is open to help associate always. The hardest part of the job is when I have to wake up early for be there and when some customers are with the bad humor. The most important part of the job is to help people to communicate like foreign people. Specially when I have to translate to Hispanic and deaf people (Spanish language and Sign language). In true, It is a pleasure for me to help to another."
good,"at home depot i learned to work in an environment  that was very challenging and also rewarding, this workplace was constantly booming with customers so i had go be sure i kept a positive attitude and work ethic"
good,Love the job . I would recommend the job for anyone that’s looking for work. The management makes you feel like you at home. Customer service was one of the easiest thing to do
good,"Capacitación continua"
good,"Its a good place to work...friendly place, good atmosphere, and good customers. Never a bad moment when working here. My customer service went to a different level and was willing to help customers at all times."
good,I work for the Merchandising team. The vendors pay Home Depot to take care of their areas in the store. Work Monday through Friday 5 am to 1:30 PM. No weekends or Holidays.
good,"It’s a great environment and the associates are like family, the company will really make you feel welcome and important which I really appreciate. Management can sometimes be very dysfunctional, but it’s a very big store with only a handful of managers so it’s to be expected."
good,"Great company. If you are looking for advancement or a career, they typically fill management positions from within. Work experience is valued more than college degrees."
good,"Home depot is a great place to work."
good,"Good place to start off. It was easy to move up, but it was hard to move once you got really good at one position. Managers wanted to keep you where you good at and not let you grow"
good,I really loved working here. I went in for just a part-time job but when they saw my resume they offered me and department supervisor position. I stayed there almost a year I really enjoyed it I only left because I got offered a job one more money. I had three small kids at the time so I had to take a job that paid more money. I shopped there every chance I get
good,I started in Garden for 6 years  learned some electrical and plumbing went onto Paine where I am currently however at a different store I am happy but closing hours are not good for me or my wife.
good,"Highly recommend the experience of working for this organization.  I learned people skills, product and safety information and other things that will stay with me for the rest of my life.  I moved up relatively quickly and was rewarded for hard work and dedication."
good,"I was hired on as a part time cashier for six months and became a part times plumbing associate. There is a lot of room for growth within each department, but if you want full time, try elsewhere. Unless you are hired on as full time, this job may be better for a high school or college student."
good,"Overall, the home Depot is a fantastic place to work, however management has little to no faith in their employees, and often abuses their power over them"
good,"My daily duties at home deport,"
good,It was rewarding and often a fun place to work were management showed genuine concern for all associates well being. It felt like working with family.
good,A difficult job with a wide range of highly physically demanding tasks. Compensation is fair and includes excellent benefits. Shifts were occasionally changed last minute and attendance issues came up occasionally.
good,Fast paced at beginning of shift. Slows down after truck is unloaded. Willing to work with on your schedule. Manager and Supervisor are great to with.
good,This company has given me the opportunity to fly. I loved this company and the job security and transfer criteria from one location to other that it provides. I will remain grateful to Home Depot who gave me a chance to work in an awesome environment.
good,"A good place to work, great people to work with. If you like helping people,  Home Depot is the place to be!! Management needs to improve their communication. Each manager had a different set of rules!"
good,"Management is very nice, people that work there are great. Not too hard a job. Treats associates very well. Great place to have for a first job. Highly recommended"
good,"My initial training was minimal, but after working for three months it really picked uo.  I was trained on Baleymore and forklift operation.  Management is the best of any position I've heald.  Training and safety are key at Home Depot."
good,"Close knit family atmosphere good management good benifits company training is good staff work well with each other."
good,I love working there it is stressful sometimes and it can get hectic very quickly. Everyone is nice to work with management is very approachable. You can move up quickly if you are motivated. It is tough work sometimes you are outside sometimes summer and winter. I really enjoy working at Home Depot.
good,"Great place to learn about how to repair or upgrade your home. The people you work with can be the deciding factor of whether you want to be there or not. The hardest part is the way customers treat you and how they want you to fix all their problem, even the contractors."
good,From the day I applied toy first day of work was about 10 days. Hard work is noticed and promotion and pay raise come fast. I have nothing bad to say about this job. The work wasn't easy but the management was helpful and warm coworkers were friendly and positive
good,"Freight associate is a difficult job. It's highly physical, and is usually done all night. I've learned more about myself during this job, then I have during any other jobs I've participated in before."
good,I loved being able to wear almost whatever you wanted. If you didn’t have an answer you can always depend on your co workers or the computers to assist you at any time
good,worked at home depot approx. 6 years in the elect dept.  During initial hire I  was PT.  Almost immed I was offered full time emploement (had apprx 7 year backround in residential elect) and given a immed payroll increase.  Most employee had certain areas within the dept to maint and manage.  Last two years of employment given the ability to neg. sales price on most items within the dept.  Only left due to retiement
good,Managed up to 100 associates on any given day.   Drive services and operational readiness of the store for major focus in customer and associate relations.  Managed payroll and operational profit of the day to day business.   Recieved and shipped out products to both vendors and customers.
good,"Very nice atmosphere,  working conditions are pleasant, management was up most respectful but determined,  I enjoyed working with the customers and helping when ever I could."
good,"Very good teamwork, worried managers, safety first and foremost, I like it, adequate and continuous training, we improve ourselves in customer service with quality"
good,"I’ve only been there 4 months. I don’t have any complaints They are very flexible and understanding "
good,Home Depot is a nice place to work but can be tiring.  The pay should be higher and the benefits were decent.  I met a lot of nice people. The learning experience was awesome as monthly training classes were given pertaining to your position.
good,Cares about their employees. Enjoyable place to work. Works with employees on times they are able to work.  Cross trains on all departments. Treats employees like family especially during holidays. All young job seekers should let Home Depot be their starting point for a career.  I enjoyed meeting our customers and providing them aid to make their shopping experience enjoyable. Learned a lot from every department at Home Depot
good,"I loved my hop great place to work "
good,"Is a nice experience to work for this company , people can do a career for the future increase knowledge and benefits. Solid company in business, provided to employees stability"
good,I enjoy my job at Home Depot. I think it is a great place to work. I have great managers. I have gained a tremendous amount of experience in customer service while I have been there. It is also nice to see competent management opposed to the incompetent management I have been accustomed to at previous employers.
good,Not a bad olce to work if your management team are team players. This is a job where If you want to get promoted you can there's always room for improvement
good,This job is very fast paced. Both customers are rude and associates depending on the coverage and knowledge provided. This company specifically at this location needs more workers.
good,"I really liked all of the community organizing  I did with the Home Depot. "
good,"The hardest part of the job was getting to work, everything else was easy, "
good,"It's a cool place filled with funky and loving people. I experienced funny shoppers and angry shoppers, both teaching me to be patient. Management was superb, and they help with whatever and whenever I needed. I enjoyed every second, the relationships were the best part."
good,"I have been with the company 28 years and counting.   My history"
good,I found it hard to get full time but when you do the benefits are worth all the hard work. much of the staff have been there for years and take pride in helping new employees
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with customers. The workplace culture is often uncomfortable due to  ultralight bias. I overlook the elementary attitudes and perform my tasks for the benefit of the corporation.
good,El lugar es muy bueno para laborar es relajado y siempre tratan de ayudar los campañeros
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo "
good,"If you like hard work and little pay this is the job for you,i worked my tail off for this job and all I got was a reinjured back.job was fun sometimes but for the most it was a study job"
good,The staff has worked well to ensure a fun and helpful work culture. Everyone is very helpful. The work is customer assistance so people get pulled away from work to help customers.
good,"my dot medical card was about to expire so I got one though my doctor, they still sent me through the company doctor and was denied. oh well..time to move on."
good,"I work at The Home Depot full-time for the past 2 years and 10 months."
good,"Excellent company, very family oriented.  I wish I have a Home Depot store close to where I live so I could work again for them. There are also many things that we can learn with this Company."
good,Stable Company with unlimited room for advancement. Great Benefits and retirement benefits. Many opportunities to cross train and to advance into management
good,You better be ready to work and be ready to miss family time. The one thing that stuck with me is the doors will open and close with you or without you.
good,As a P/T rep for Scotts and Ortho companies the Home Depot staff was very engaging and helpful during my time serviceing th HD's on the Hamilton/Ewing area.
good,"Schedule hours are very flexible. Management was very understanding. There is also a lot of opportunity to grow, learn and advance in different departments."
good,home depot was a excellent place work it was stree free management was good they paid well got along whit a lot of employees benefits was good i would recommend people to work there
good,I really enjoyed the garden department but especially enjoyed working overnight in the freight department stocking the store for the next day's day's sales. Felt a great sense of satisfaction after a good night's work.
good,loved working here! the people both customers and employees were a blast to work with! management was ok most of the time would work with you some times but did not work with me when i had to take care of my child. often if something came up last minuet and i called to let them know i would be late or if i had to leave early they would dock it as a no call no show or put a note in the system that i didn't want to work.
good,This is a good place to work.  Good environment.  Good benefits.  Not much for Part Time associates.  Good environment.  Good culture.  Can be fun with the right leadership and talent
good,great company to work for very people friendly family friendly it's time to give back to the community I was able to participate in building a playground for a school and when I went to go do it I got paid even though I was volunteering to help build a playground I did not know when I signed up for it then I would be getting paid but it was definitely a plus and it said a lot about the company as a whole. It was really good I was very well trained learned a lot that's a good company to work for!
good,"My new store is great!  Most of my colleagues are pleasant. The customers are wonderful and I enjoy our “regulars”.  Wish we were paid more, it is expensive to live in San Diego."
good,"While it is difficult to professionally advance within the branch, a positive work-place environment remains ever-present. Such a fast-pace environment can be challenging, but one is never without managerial support."
good,The Home Depot and its environement is a great place to work. I love it so far. I get to interact with customers and help people find the right product to improve their lives. Only thing that makes me interested in another job or second job is the rate of pay and the fact its Part Time to start.
good,"Home depot is a great company to work for and provides substantial benefits. "
good,Everyone is so welcoming and helpful. It's a very nice company to work for as everyone works together and not against each other. And there is no discrimination against LGBT or elderly.
good,"well i was there to help out in the store with customer questions. Solve customer problems with projects that they were working on. I could build orders on the computer and also pull orders as well. I sold product both stock and special order. I was there to load customers and make sure they didn't leave anything. I packed out stock merchandise down to customer level also doing housekeeping sweeping picking up trash and product off the floor. etc... I was in the delivery section for two years which meant I was in charge of getting all the customer orders either ready for pick-up or delivery. I was trained to drive fork-lift, order picker, electric pallet jack, and slip truck. The hardest part was dealing with unruly customers. My most enjoyable part of work was figuring out peoples problems.  The management was there for workers as they needed them."
good,"As soon as you clock in and walk out the break room customers tend to run up to you so you can help them find something. As you try to walk to your department the questions never stop. If you are working in a department of 4 people working at a time, the department looks ok when closing but during peak hours of 10-2pm its crazy. There is always training to do which is good, its training sent from corporate every month. The management is great but that depends where you go. No matter where there will always be that one manager that he or she needs self coaching I guess. But for the most part they want to do good for the company. The workplace culture, you will definetly meet alot of different people from all parts of the world. The diversity is immense here. The hardest part of the job like every job is getting them to sign up for credit cards lol. The most enjoyable part of working here is that people working here really care about our veterans and the communities near by."
good,"While my stay was short, as an intern I was given the opportunity to develop myself and my skills. I was given challenges and the people within the company where incredibly patient and looked forward to me learning from them and their experiences."
good,you went and got your freight for your department and you worked it all down the straightened up sweep then if you have time you would go help elsewhere if needed
good,"Its a great job, they make sure that you are properly trained before you make it to the floor so expect that the first week will be in an office. If you open each day will start with a sort of rundown of what to expect and then a cheer (not my thing but other people seemed to like it). The store has its own community and in my stores case it felt like a friendly neighborhood where you see nearly everyone in all levels of management and if I ever had any concerns they were more than happy to help you out. It can be a little tough wearing steel toed shoes all day and standing on concrete floors so make sure to have good soles. I was always happy to go to work."
good,i start at 7 helping customers it gets busy sometimes not enough coverage lines get long 2 cashiers back up cashiers dont respond sometimes so can get stressful me personally try to get customers in and out.
good,"Careerwise, I reinvented myself and was lucky enough to work for one of the best companies I have ever worked for.  Home Depot is not perfect, BUT has it has it down to a science: intense and constant training for all associates to learn all products and services.  There are no dull moments. Wow, did I learn! I was encouraged to not only learn all departments, functions, and duties but to have fun with it.  And I did, to the fullest!  When I first started, I didn't know a soul. When I left to pursue other career opportunities, I had gained an entire family, who I still hold dear to my heart and touched my soul."
good,Great company to work for. Looks after it's employees like family. Best part of job is working with customers and associates. There is never a dull day or moment.
good,"Unlike most companies, Home Depot seems to have good people at the corporate level in my experience with them. All of the problems I've had with employees were at lower levels like regular associates and some department managers. Overall, it seems like a secure place to work and it's pretty relaxed if you work during the day. There might be a lot more work during the night shift. If I could go back and work my way up into management, I would."
good,"I enjoyed the culture and benefits of being an employee. Management was supportive and always encouraged growing in the company. Employee profit sharing, numerous catered luncheons etc."
good,All in all a very good place to experience customer service and work ethic. I learn how to use a pallet jack forklifts reach lifts electric pallet jacks etc .
good,"Would like to work again for Home Depot. Great place to work . Employees were very helpful to me when needed.Overall, I enjoyed working there. I would return if they would rehire me."
good,At the Home Depot. The inventory department Management team is one of the best managers i have worked with. They are very knowledgeable and they promote a very diverse environment
good,"Great place to work, but as a large employer, there are ""cliques"" with some of the employees.  Wouldn't want to work there full time, but as a part time second job, it worked well."
good,Good place to work. They believe in promoting from within. Great managers and help employees in need. The managers are great and they help you succeed at the company.
good,The Home Depot was a big learning opportunity I got to work with a lot of contractors and learn a lot from my fellow staff they provide onsite training ready at your fingertips.
good,"Home Depot is fun, fast paced job. The customers where the best part. Assisting with answering questions regarding their home projects while providing great customer service."
good,working at home depot was a great and enjoyable time i learn alot working there how to make and mix paint. how to label and use the first phone. management sometime was great but they help you in some area
good,"you meet new people and different types of costumers, its nice to make conversations with them and find what their projects would be, and i love when they bring their pets to the store"
good,"great store to work at, the company really cares about you."
good,"A typical day at work, I'd clock in get to the paint pit and was immediately flooded with customers wanting questions answered and paint made while at first it seems intimidating it always felt rewarding knowing I had helped customers and my associates alike."
good,I was told I would really like working here.  I've been there a short while and I can honestly say I Love working there.  I just have to wait my turn to be a full time employee.  The benefits are excellent and the store is one big family.  They take care of their own.
good,"I loved working there you kept busy and was like one big family. Pay was good for a part-time job, got to help customers and got to know new products and how things worked."
good,"This was a very good place to work, awesome management staff and employees! They're very understanding of your personal life and home life and if you ask for days off in advance you will more than likely get them!"
good,"Just overall good balanced job with advancements. Management has gotten better,  and with that employee environment was great after. Recommend this job."
good,Every six months they have fun mini parties. Get huge checks that were the best. Came at the right time when you need a little more money for that l that month.
good,"Awesome place to work at , pay isn’t bad for what it is. The people there are really nice and helpful. The benefits are also really nice and help out a lot."
good,"Home depot would be greater with better management "
good,"I worked here while going to school and love the atmosphere. It allows competitive pay and good benefits. I work full time with school full time which is not generally an option, but the manager saw my dedication and allows me to do so"
good,"I have been with Home Depot for almost 3 years and working here has probably been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I have had some wonderful supervisors, managers and coworkers of all different ages and backgrounds. They offer health benefits although I don’t use them now, and 401k. Most importantly, I am a full time college student and Home Depot has been nothing but cooperative and flexible with my crazy schedule. I’ve gone on LOA several times and each time I come back I am welcomed back with open arms by management, fellow employees and regular customers. I absolutely love and recommend the Home Depot if you are in need of a flexible, fun part time job."
good,"Typical day includes arriving to work, and immediately  start up with a group start up meeting. You learn safety in the workplace. The workplace culture different ages, different backgrounds, and its very diverse. The hardest part would be the the hour would change when the company became busy . The most enjoyable part is that they provide great benefit. They also provide discounts for all of your online shopping need."
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for and a great place to shop.  The Customer Service / Special Services department is very busy and I have learned many things about the company over all.
good,The job itself was probably one of the easiest and easy to pick up jobs I’ve had. The hardest part was being on my feet all day but even that wasn’t that hard. It’s a great place to be and slowly stops feeling like work
good,"The Home Depot offers excellent benefits to their employees. Great work environment, I liked my job and the people I worked with. We worked together as a team."
good,"I learned a lot working at the Home Depot. It was a fun atmosphere, interactive, competitive, strict, and fast paced. I enjoyed the time I had with my co-workers and everybody seemed to work well with one another. I liked my managers and learned valuable life lessons in a work environment."
good,Learnt a  lot and was able to maintain a prefect balance between family and work life. Management is good and there are lot of learning opportunities. Deliver on time and you are always in good hands.
good,"I enjoyed working at the home depot I wanted to advance but circumstances at the time did not allow me a career advancement"
good,"Having a set schedule and a set job everyday was really nice. Getting to just go through and make each bay look nice again, working on projects, getting to have a solid team environment is really nice."
good,"The work pace is steady. The hours are flexible and reasonable. They offer great benefits, 401k, and employee stock purchase plans. They also offer discounts and paid vacations."
good,"Pro's:"

good,I had a great experience overall with the home Depot. i started out in the electrical department as a sales associate and ended up promoted to Department Head and then to Ops Manager. They definitely promote from within for those who earn it and work hard; however the pay at the Ops manager versus the responsibilities was sorely lacking.

Whatever task was given to you, you can go about doing in whatever way you feel more fit to you. as long as you got your most pressing task done the managers would not hassle you.

good,The Home Depot warehouse is a fast paced work environment.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the relationships you build with your co-workers and some of the management team.  The hardest part about the job is the fact that some people in management are numbers driven and fail to make the associates safety and well-being the number one priority.
good,Assisted customers in loading of materials. Construction materials and or walk customers through the aisles and assist them with that they were looking for.
good,"The Home Depot is not a typical retail environment, in that you are not only expected to know the location of product within the store, you are also expected to know the applications of the products. All product knowledge is provided with paid training, and you are generally expected to complete all training before starting a position in the department. As with any other retail position, the largest factor is how well the management team operates."
good,"I've spent almost a year at this location and look forward to going in to work, seeing the staff, and meeting and helping customers even though many require a lot of handholding. That's the nature of retail. "

good,"In California I was in charge of getting people to open a charge account. I had a weekly amount I was required to get. I also helped on the floor, I became certified in all the departments so I could help. I taught tiling classes, Also was a Cashier.& worked the ""pro"" desk"
good,"Home Depot is a wonderful company to work for. I love meeting new people and working with many people from various employment backgrounds and expertise.

There is a really strong workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the deadline.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the conversations.

We answered incoming calls from logistics companies and arranged high volume deliveries to our facility. Additionally, my team systemically checked in every trailer and was the single driving force in determining manpower needs. Our team also handled a variety of issues from the stores that we delivered to."

This place teaches you how to handle hard spots and working together. Managing money and completing Tasks. If your only looking for part time this place was great working with your time.

good,"I loved my job there at The Home Depot, but it was time for me to go and find something worth the money. I wouldn't really change anything but the management, there are a few there including the HR person that need to redirect themselves back to the wheel.And really focus  on the respect part, because instead of helping other they like to put people down about their looks and not some much about their job performance. and this is at store 0413 in Phoenix, AZ."

good,"Good people, great customers. Easy advancement. Only problem working for the Home Depot, the pay is not great and the most they pay is 14.00, that being a department supervisor."
good,Overall it was a fun place to work.  I didn't mind the hours. I started out as part time with a flexible schedule. But went full time with a set schedule because the contractor manger wanted me there Monday through Friday to open for the regulars. I just needed more money.

good,"The Home Depot was a great place to work, they gave me a chance when no other company would. Definitely showed me how to interact more with people. Really was a great place to work."
good,"On the surface, when you first start working for this organization it does seem like it is one of those jobs that if you let it, you can get lost. The opportunities are there if you want them and there are plenty. Love the employees because everyone help you and most people are very friendly. Great place to earn about the home improvement business. The benefit that are given to you are top notch and there is a stock option that is pretty good. Caution, the work can be very hard at time"
good,"Enjoyed working out in the weather and not limited to a desk. The culture included cookouts and events that contributed to team building and events also filled the day."
good,"The work is hard, but the people are good and everyone is dedicated to making sure the job is done appropriately."
good,"My main role was down stocking product. Occasionally, I would have product too heavy for me to lift and I have been penalized for not being able to down stock it. However, it is a very friendly work environment with easily met expectations."
good,"Loved it here, co workers were nice the customers were fun to get to know! A lot going on everyday and I like to keep busy and meet new people so this was a great place to work the management is all about favoritisms so other than them everything else was awesome."
good,Home Depot is a great job however it has bad points too because some of the employees are lazy and I end up picking up their slack. I am the Kid's Workshop Captain so I work with the children who come into the store plus I hold the lead for the most Credit Cards obtain in our district so I work very hard to achieve high standards for myself.
good,"Pues aprindi a trabaja mas como equipo, una le las empresas en donde uno se siente comodo nada se hace dificil..."
good,"Home Depot was a great place for me starting out of college. Home Depot will train you on everything you need to know, and they are very flexible with your personal hours if you have to shift hours around."
good,The home depot is a great place. The managment is the best I have ever worked for  they care about their staff like family. My co-works are all the same way we take care of each other.
good,Great people to work with and something about working at a hardware store that makes you feel good. You learn allot of things and are able to apply that knowledge in the real world.
good,"The job is fun and productive,but they need flexible work hours and offer more hours for asscoiates. I enjoy working there;everyone works together and the work environment is good."
good,management was understanding and willing to help when needed. typical night at home depot was displaying new displays and new products for the customers. the enjoyable part of this job was putting out new products.
good,"This is a great place to learn a lot about home improvement and others. People here a great and and sometimes amazing. But for me not so much for the hours,"
good,"The best retail company to work for. The management team is friendly and listen to your needed. The group discussions in the morning are very informative, and the management team keeps you updated on product and services, overall how the store is doing. If you need a part time job...Home Depot is where you need to be."
good,I would have to say that you have to have a open mind .Be ready to move around and do different jobs in a second.If you want you can learn as much as you want.All you have to do is ask or have someone teach you.When there is OT you can get as much as you want.When its a little slow you can stay or the can VTO you its your choice.The supervisors are very friendly they help you in any way they can.They do there jobs but make you feel part of the family.We used to have a fun comity .We come up  different ideas for the employees to have a little fun in the work day but also be safe.
good,well being a department manager was fun getting know a different people around the world I had lot fun being very young and never had a complaint about I treat people and people will come back twice a day just to see me.

good,"It was a wonderful time working at The Home Depot, the customers came in and knew what they wanted, making it easy to do your job on helping people and maintaining the departments."
good,"Great place to work that does not require an education and other"
good,If you enjoy fast paced environment and working as a team great place to work. Very diverse atmosphere with great management. Customers always create new experiences
good,Many opportunities for advancement especially at the entry level. It is absolutely a place that what you put into it you get out. It can be a very physically demanding workplace.
good,"Great work environement, friendly colleagues, and managment is great. management understands we are human beings and aren't your typical corporate zombies."
good,"I loved my job at Home Depot. Being a cashier meant being the last person a customer would see after purchases. We were responsible for customer satisfaction and service, as well as loss prevention. There were times when I felt like I was the only one working, but, The Home Depot allows employees to make customer service decisions on their own when needed,"
good,"This is a job aimed towards great customer service, a standard that is mandated and respected by the management, however, there are times when it can be a tough and demanding job but it has to be done."
good,I definitely appreciated the atmoshpere. I was given an oppurtunity to be a specialist by a manager who saw my potential during my interview and was able to flourish thanks to the great leadership and team mentality.
good,"I worked with great people , great organization , I enjoyed my time there  helping to repair and maintain the tool inventory , it was related to my technical experience as a mechanic."
good,Wish they would give you full time work and a steady hours.They take to long on moving workers to full time not fast enough. Need to take care of there better employees.
good,Being a part time cashier and customer service representative required basic skills and knowledge. Like working a cash register or even assisting with self checkouts or even assisting customers with their online orders. Standing is a must so you most definitely needed comfortable shoes and proper attire. The atmosphere is phenomenal and everyone got along for the most part. The hardest part about my job was really nothing. Stay positive The most enjoyable part for me was learning where everything were in each department. I like learning how things work so I would constantly ask questions.
good,Almost all employees that worked with me were employed with The home depot for 15 plus years. Overall the atmosphere is just like a family. Benefits are great but do not start to kick in until after your 90 day probational period. They have many good programs and things they do for their employees as well. Pay is very competitive as well compared to other retail stores the pay is great. Only issue I had was that if you are not a supervisor or manager during holidays hours are cut drastically.
good,"Fast-paced, customer expect a lot of you but it feels very rewarding for your efforts. Great place to learn the basics of home care and gardening, but as I said before, as any other retail company, depends deeply in the leadership team"
good,"I worked for a Home Depot PRO.  We have a good company to work for. We celebrate holidays with a pot luck (occasionally). Management are nice and good people.  Everyone are helpful, friendly, caring and respectful. Most importantly, we all got along."
good,I enjoy working with the public and helping customers with their purposes.  I like to work with financing and being a cashier.  I like to solve problems.
good,Everybody got along great no one was rude or disrespectful everyone cared for everyone. Management was great. I overall really liked working there very much.
good,Working at Home Depot was a very good experience for me. I learned a lot on a daily basis from management and meeting people from all over the world. I also learned how to trouble shoot and fix the registers and self checkout machines.
good,The Home Depot is a wonderful place to work at. All the employees can be seen doing their best to make sure the customer leaves with what they wanted and with a smile on their face.
good,"I like working at The Home Depot, the work is challenging and fun.  I love interacting with customers, and working in a specialty department gives me freedom to move around the store and not just help others in my department, but all over the store."
good,good for retired people or high school Fun place they work well with your schedual. understanding. flexible . over a good expirence and fun environment
good,"scheduled installations and coordinated great customer service and follow up. I learned so much while there. management was great,I also used excel and ms word often."
good,The best employees are the one who have been there since the 90's. The company was very generous back then and they bought their loyalty. If they made the same investment in the people now associates would be more motivated.
good,"A typical day is casual, stress levels minimal."
good,My overall work experience was very good. Assisting customers was one of the things that I enjoyed most. Being part of a team with the same work ethics like the importance of maintaining a clean and safe warehouse was also great. Having to teach the new employees how to do the job was one of the part of the job that was least enjoyable being that I had to report any and all work mishaps..
good,Professional and organized work environment with well trained managers.  Monthly safety modules. Fun people to work with and proper training. Would return to work there.
good,you're always busy if you're not assisting a customer you're maintaining your department. very easy to move up especially in the front end as a cashier.
good,I learned a lot while working at Home Depot as a cashier we had to know were the different items where at in the different departments. I had to also know what department to call for for the certain product to ask for a particular item.
good,"Follow instructions from the supervisors and/or store manager, assistant store manager, be on  time, due overtime if with a customer, culture is perfect cannot be shy, you learn a lot if you pay attention to other parts of the business, get to know the store manager for more knowledge."
good,"Hey it's retail, so if you have strong product knowledge and you enjoy customer service this is the place to be. Good environment benefits were ok, and worked with a kick  team.."
good,Great individuals to work along side. Flexible Schedules. Family oriented environment. Tasks completed in a timely manner. Enjoy coming to work daily.
good,"Ecellent place to work, good benefits, fair wages, team player atmosphere, store to store competitions advancement opportunities job security willingness to transfer"
good,"I have learned so much at Home Depot, it was a very fast paced which I liked, sometimes poor managment."
good,noothing really to say just it was nice to work there nothing bad to say but just did not get along with the manager. other the that very good company to work for
good,Awesome starter job but also a great career opportunities if desired. You can go as far as you want or can excell in your position for the moment you are there.
good,A typical day for me at work is standing in the front making sure customer have what they wanted or helping customer find what they need. Able to talk to your co-worker.
good,"Working at the Home Depot you are able to learn about every item in your store if you want to or you can just stay close to your own department but, management would prefer if the associates try to branch out to other departments of the store."
good,you always have great people to work with. the management isnt the definition of leadership. It was more like them just bossing you around to make themselves look good in higher managements eyes.
good,"Great job, great people. Willing to work with you and your balance your work and personal life. STAY BUSY. The only hard part is when people call out and there isn't much coverage."
good,"Working for The Home Depot is a great way to learn customer service skills, as well as learning common knowledge about renovating."
good,"Provided external clients with home improvement solutions from sales to do it yourself projects."
good,Great company to work for at times stressful but fun at times also scheduling was good management was great and the benefits were good overall good company to work for
good,Great place to work. Bosses were amazing and really there to help. Associates all got along and was a big team effort which helps us excel. Would definitely recommend to others.
good,"Management is great, job is easy but the customers make job difficult for the pay you're receiving, pay raise if hard to get and full-time request is years long."
good,"My experience there was excellent. I was paid fairly well for what could've easily been a minimum wage job and was provided options for benefits and stock."
good,Fast-paced enviroment based on excellent customer service. Plenty of oppertunities to advance and learn new skills. Management is fair and consistent. Diversified work place that celebrates all employees.
good,"As the title says it's a great place to work. Most positions are part-time, which is something to be aware of. "
good,Work there about 4 months and already recognized as an associate of the month. the team is very laid back and understanding. Supervisor always helpful and encouraging. Home Depot is a place for these who wants to feel right at home.
good,Home Depot was a good second job workers were very nice and helpful when you needed help and as a  customer service company home depot stresses that the customer once he walks into the store someone is their to help at once
good,"I love my Home Depot job but with the newest labor reform, part time hours are cut. I make good hourly money but it doesn't mean anything if I don't get the hours. Also, management is great (for the most part) but when it comes to sales-per-hour quotas, other specialty associates take your sales and management is okay with it and they don't/won't do much to fix it. Success sharing is awesome. A check gets cut every six months of all of the extra money made from sales plan. Its kinda nice."
good,Typically was good and no real complaints that stand out or need to be mentioned. The only thing that was a concern were a lack of cohesion between managers
good,This job required most if not all employees to have some kind of contact with people. Every associate did their best to help customers who seemed to need it. There are many different positions in the Home Depot. I worked as a freight associate before closing. This job required the ability to locate where a product was placed on the sales floor and to restock. The products vary  in size and weight so different days had different challenges. Overall this was a great working environment and plenty of people who make the job more interesting. I would recommend a position if you like to interact with other people. It is a peoples people job.
good,Company has set schdule for full time associates as management need to be available at any time. Company provides food on all holidays and still makes bonuses available to all.
good,"I love working for The Home Depot.  I have only been working for the company for two years, but I will tell you that after the first year I got a promotion.  I have a military background working in Logistics and Warehouses so it was easy for me to use the equipment."
good,I think all jobs all there ups and downs but Ibelieve the hardest part of the job was having to make orders for customers and after progressing everything they decide to change their mind .Not only do you feel like you have wasted a ton of time but you start to get annoyed because you feel like whatever you are doing for the customer isn't enough .That's when problem solving is needed .
good,"Satisfied with the service that was given to me while working there. Had no issues with management, always willing to work to solve issues rather then terminate you"
good,"Overall great place to work for! Staff was amazing & everyone is always so friendly! Garden was the best part (you got to listen to music while waiting for customers to storm the place). "

Management varied from store to store, but mine was excellent and was comprised of people who wanted you to succeed."
good,"Mostly everyone start off part-time  but after your 90 days are up , you qualify for full-time. You can definitely grow within the store! Enjoyed working for this company."

The people, for the most part, are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is when people call out and there just isn't enough people in the store for what needs done. I've learned to be a team player and not to ask dumb questions."
good,"I have worked for Home Depot for a short time. I have enjoyed the fast pace and it is not micro-managed. They give you a list of things to be accomplished and you go at it. If you need help moving things they are team oriented and jump in to help. "
good,My typical day at work involved reviewing numbers from day to day and trying to create a gameplan to improve them. Interacting with my team and coworkers on the days task and ways to accomplish them. Interacting with Customers and fullfilling their needs and giving them a great Customer experience. Meet with managers to get their perspective of ways to improve shopping experience and review numbers and other issues to relay to my team.
good,"Nice place to work but dont ever get stuck working at the customer service desk. Never enough associates to cover the desk, no pay increase for going to Customer Service desk. Cant get out of it once youre in there because they do not want to train new associates because there is too much to learn and not enough training."
good,I enjoyed interacting with all the customers. The management was fair and they cared about any issue you had with your job. The hardest part for me is I am more of a fast paced person and I didn't enjoy standing in one spot to much near the registers.
good,"I love being orange.  This outside sales stuff can be low income at times as it is 100% commission.  We should get a base salary, and pay when required to be in the store.  Also mileage should be paid."

good,The highlight would be the job culture but this is based on a review from 14 years ago.  Great upper management with strong support to middle management which encouraged advancement and promoted from within yet it was rare since employment retention was extremely high.  Competitive among departments with appropriate rewards for reaching goals.
good,its enjoyable to work in a place where you don't have to be too careful what you say. the labor is not too difficult if you are able to lift around 50 pounds..

good,This is a really great company to work for with great benefits. Love how this company helps their local communities. Pay is pretty close to living cost.
good,"Working at the Home Depot is a roller coaster of emotions, from fulfilling to downright dull. There are those good days in which productivity and efficiency are spectacular, and you can clock out with a sense of pride. On others, well, you don't. The place is friendly, and everyone looks out for one another. Whenever you have a problem, you don't have to worry about asking for help. If you've got what it takes, the Home Depot can be your home away from home."
good,"Great place to work, but the general manager need to have better communication skills with his employees. If something is wrong he needs to know and show them how to do it right and know how thing are going and project going on. I really don't think these manager take the time to really see what the problems is and how to fix it. The paper work the employees get are so badly printed and the project do not have step by step or picture graphs to help do it covertly."
good,Throughout my time at Home Depot I learned many skills by working in different departments. Management was not open to other ideas and made decisions that hindered the customers shopping and employees working experience. If you love customer service and learning it is a great company to set as a career. They are normally very involved with the community.

The company provides informational clinics for their customers and employees to attend. The management is very kind and most department heads work with you on different tasks. The workplace culture is very nice too. I really like all the opportunities that Home Depot provides for their employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at home depot, it has a very fast paced environment with a lot of employee benefits to manage, questions to answer and issues to be addressed"
good,Everything was fine until they decided to relocate operations out of state to GA and UT.  With that came a shift in management and my last manager was a real not nice person.

good,Home Depot was a fun relaxed comfortable place to work you have the ability to move up quickly but there pay raises don’t add up to the work u do the management is easy going and if you ever have a problem with the manager there u can take it to corporate and corporate is always fair so if u feel like the management is being unfair there there’s higher people up u can go to the work is face paced but not to much and they give u enough room to let u be you and express who you are and work freely

good,Home Depot always put their customer's first and that is a good effort to make a business grow and survive in the market.

good,"A typical day is generally fast paced and very busy, however, there are slower times. Home Depot often sends employees to learning seminars so there is much to be learned. They make sure their employees really know the products that they sell. Management is great and the workplace culture is generally great. Most employees get along. The hardest part of the job for a woman is male customers who don't trust that a woman could know or do her job well.

good,I dont intend on leaving but growing as an individual would be nice. I feel like i can do that here. Maybe someday ill become a supervisor or even manager of this place.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at HD. The pay was ok, but I found the benefits to be expensive. I was able to advance fairly easily and go to school part time while working part time."
good,"If you like working with people this would be a good fit for you. I was able to develop long lasting friendships with the associates and good relationships with the customers. I had fun most of the time. The only negative I would say is that if you work under a poor store manager  or assistant manager, you will be screwed! That will determine how hard it will be for you to make it with the company."
good,"The culture of Home Depot is really good.  It is team oriented, take care of associates, take care of the customer and everything else will take care of itself."
good,Working with the associates is the best thing ever happened in 17 years with my experience with Home Depot. Keeps you busy nice to interact with customers
good,Worked through college as a cashier and worked by way up to Front End Supervisor. Great place to work had a lot of fun. Customers can be tough as most retail positions are like this. The only reason I left was because I was moving and my management team had no interest in promoting from within to Asst Store Mgr or higher.
good,"I really liked working for Home Depot probably one of the best jobs I had really. I just wish they had more hours for me at the time, I loved my regular customers and the staff was fun to work for."
good,"The Home Depot has a solid moral compass. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."
good,"people are great, pay is low. management always has fun stuff going on for the associates. great place to move up started as a cashier and moved to another department. i love working here i just wish they payed more."

good,"Works outstanding with or without others on different tasks"
good,I enjoy the workplace but it does not offer overtime nor do I feel the pay is fair. I would rather a job that offer more hours (overtime) and better pay for the work being done...
good,"Good work environment. Safe, Good balance between wok and personal life.  Management was enjoyable to work with.  Nothing about the job was objectionable."
good,"customers are great most of the co workers are also great.However there is such a great divide in the work flow.The workload is not shared evenly or fairly and no one seems to notice or if they do it is not addressed.If you complain about the fairness you are told"" to do you ""."
good,"I loved working at The Home Depot, everyone is friendly time fly's when you're happy and loving your job. The Home Depot is all about helping customers as well as employees."
good,At the store level I believe that The Home Depot is a great place to work. However when store managers get swapped around like nothing and mid level to high level managers start declaring edicts and laws to be enforced when they don't ask the employees how moral is there is a problem higher up. What I did experience with the assistant managers and the culture that was employee related was fantastic and a very loving and caring environment.
good,"Our customers were fantastic.  Being able to come in every morning and once the doors opened, be greeted by some of the best customers ever! My co-workers were super and we all worked as a team to make our store #1."
good,Home Depot continues to train me for the current position that I have.  The company is very progressive in their training culture and in their safety program.  I have a really great team that I work with and enjoy my job.  My management is very willing to listen to my ideas and concerns.
good,Need more people there that have pride in working to make customer service easier. It is retail so turn over and call offs are common. People are unreliable.
good,"This company really values every one who works for them. I loved coming into work every day. There are many opportunities for advancement and it can be competitive, but that's part of the fun. Would highly recommend working here."
good,"It has been the best retail job i have ever had."
good,"It was a great place to work, Not enough hours,  The team I worked with was great as to management and other workers in the company. Had  a great experience there. If offered a full time position, I would go back"

good,"I really enjoyed working at Home Depot the customers,co-workers and boss' were great. we had small work socials on occasion and got to know more about each other."
good,"Upbeat atmosphere/real attempt to have a family feel to the business 4 customers and staff alike/awards,stock options and cash incentives were readily available"
good,Amazing company but the store I worked at is small and always shorthanded! If I lived anywhere else I would have stayed forever! I started as a cashier and within 3 months was promoted to head cashier. Then six months later I was promoted again to project specialist! My last position was service desk and it was a great fit for me but management changed and it all went downhill!
good,"I was a sales associate in the electrical dept."
good,"A typical work day is busy, and somewhat fast paced. I have learned many skills while employed, management is good, and understanding. Workplace culture is fun, enjoyable, and feels like family. Supervisors recognize hard work, and give awards."
good,"I love the culture, the people, management. Everyone is down to earth and willing to provide excellent customer service. They are very flexible with you if you have a 2nd job or school."
good,Values are incredibly important in this day and age.  This work environment provides a great balance of support and commitment for its workers.  I have a great team and training plan to continue growth.
good,I have to get on my register help the customer to get check out easily and fast. Answer any home improvement question they might have. work fast paced.
good,"I worked the cash register"
good,"Es una gran empresa, tiene muchas ramas para crecer y apoya mucho a sus empleados"
good,I would say working at Home Depot showed me how the real world of work is and how it's important to pay attention and work hard for what you want in life so you can have a prosperous future and career.
good,"The workplace culture at The Home Depot was great. The co-workers are very friendly, and always willing to help. Management is great as they understand people make mistakes and try to help each and every person help."
good,HD it is a nice place to work since there is a lot of respect for every cultural background. They hold different events to promote integrity and respect.
good,"Loved the working atmosphere! I worked for Detail At Retail, a merchandising subcontractor for Home Depot. Liked moving around and not sitting behind a desk. Also liked working independently."
good,"Excelente empresa, muy buenos compañeros se valora a la gente y dan oportunidad a la misma de seguir subiendo de puesto y en tanto a la gente de RH muy buen trato te ayudan en todo lo que se puede"
good,"My day started when the doors were closed for the night. Come in, make sure the receiving area is cleared of freight, report to the heaviest department to begin working. Once we finish stocking we clean and clear aisles for the customers. Management was great for my first job. Both my supervisors helped me get through my early weeks of the job, along with the many helpful employees. The entire freight team helped me get through my difficult early months, but after the help i started to enjoy working in general. Never a dull moment working overnights as there is always something to do."
good,"Signing in on your shift and cashiering. Making sure that the customers were well informed on where the items that they may be looking for were found. Making sure you greet the customer with a smile and making their experience was excellent. The hardest part of the job was standing on concrete all day. The most enjoyable was knowing that you had a family of employees that would do anything for you in whatever you needed by pulling together to support you. Also the customers, getting to know them, your regulars and know what they wanted pretty much when they walked in."
good,"At the location I worked, I really love it. Management team was great, work environment and co-workers were all great. I felt the job was fair for the pay received. No complaints. I had a medical issue and had to resign or else I would be there still. Would definitely recommend."
good,"I like the team that I work on which is the Merchandising Execution Team (MET). It is our duty to stock, organize, and set the store on a daily basis and to act as a liaison for customers and store associates. There are many lessons that I have learned at this company, such as building relationships and taking care of others. The management staff is great about working with the team to complete tasks efficiently and effectively, and the culture is hands down one of the best I have ever seen and lived by. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to come into work and perform various jobs every day while also having the chance to learn something new at the same time."
good,"A typical day started at 7pm and went on into the night. There was always a large truck that needed to be unloaded, which took no less than 1 hour and no ore than 2 hours."
good,"Home Depot is a Company that truly focuses on employee development. After all the more knowledgeable you are, the more valuable you are to them. Training opportunities for heavy machinery, online work orders and more are consistently available. Always something to keep busy with as well."
good,"I began to work for Home Depot in late July 2017. I informed management that I was a full time college student initially and they did an exceptional job working with my schedule allowing flexibility with my work hours. The job itself was relatively easy, but time consuming. But I can say that I do enjoy working there because my co-workers and management are very easy to get along with and approachable when I have any questions. The difficult portion is working the night shift throughout the week when I have class throughout the day. This leads to time management which I have learned to manage in a previous job."
good,"fast pase job but had to leave it because of my education I went back to college and need it more time to persue my carrear."
good,"the management is great team, very friendly work environment. the employees are are to work and a lot of room for advancement with in the company. plenty of overtime"
good,Great place to work. Awesome management. Good benefit package. Work schedule was tough because of the late nights and almost every weekend. All in all a positive experience.
good,"They have 3 shifts, and training is or was 3 months, and after you move from the classroom to the calling floor, you are working with someone for 2-3 wks.  The work is easy and enjoyable, taking calls for all over the U.S. you get a 1 hour lunch brk, and through out the day of your shift the company has employees go through out the call floor with snacks for everyone. (to keep you on your toes) The company also has a Homer Fund that you can get help through, It's a grate company..."
good,"As a supervisor, my typical day consisted of notifying the upper management team that I was present and ready for work. Checked in on my department and the workers to ensure their needs were met. Review the numbers for the day before and prepared for the numbers that were expected for the day of. The management team all worked together and fostered an environment to train and develop. The hardest part was leaving work on time but the most enjoyable part was helping the customers."
good,I enjoyed being an Appliance Specialist.  I enjoyed assisting customers with their appliance selections and meeting new people.  My co-workers were fantastic.  The only reason I left this position was because of the distance to travel for a part-time position.
good,"The Home Depot provided us with a continuous online training about our job as Cashier and there was also a test after each series of topics that were discussed online. The manager during my time is so friendly, yet, he checks that we all do our job well. High respect for him and my other superiors. No job is easy but i could say, it's fulfilling working with my co-employees and with our customers in the store. A great working experience with The Home Depot!"
good,I greatly enjoyed working at Home Depot. You can really learn a ton from managers and cross training into different departments. I would highly recommend this job to people. It is difficult working weekends all the time and work life balance can be complicated but it is retail .
good,"Good place to work, a lot of incentives, room for advancement  , good benefits to payed vacations, sick days, leave of a sense, fund raisers for employees, awards, bounces, advancement, raises, and health care"
good,"Every day I'd come in at 5 am face the tile aisle, down stock, load cars, do special orders, and cut carpet/blinds. However I was the only hardliner and had no help except from 2 other people from my department when we had 8 people in the department in total."
good,I worked in the call center prior to it closing down. I looked forward to going to work every day. They actually appreciate their employees and go above and being to support their employees.
good,"Great environment, friendly people, helpful management. Varied tasks and assignments allow for change. Casual attire and low stress. Great company. Wish more opportunity for advancement."
good,Had a great time working at Home depot. I just noticed  the more you advance the more the company would try to push you out because since you are a long-term employee there they do not want to keep on giving raises so they push you out and they hire young kids so they can pay them at minimum wage
good,Great workplace for customer service oriented individuals.  The company's core values are lived each day as we take care of both customers and associates.
good,"its very fast paced. standing on your feet all day. sometimes you work 12 hour shifts a day. monday thru sat."
good,Career growth and advancement is promising with THD. Great place to work and many opportunities to grow. Hard work but rewarding at the same time. Cultural

good,Es una empresa muy buena te brinda todas las prestaciones de la ley.. Cuidan mucho al empleado.. Aportan mucho a la comunidad en situaciones humanitarias..
good,"Great part time work.  Freight Crew PT'ers generally had second jobs.  So this what just extra work.  The work was fine.  Stocking, sorting, staging, picking and replenishing.  Typical warehouse job.  Benefits where good the longer you stayed and if you got on full-time.  However, there were some useful benefits for PT workers.  Overall, it was a fine place to work."
good,"This retail based US home improvement outfit is fast paced and give one the opportunity to aid business growth and extend sales targets. I always train my staff to be proactive in maximizing sales, preventing losses, proper store floor layout, adequate store stocking, and be at key areas to help every customer."
good,"Although I believe that the culture of Home Depot is fantastic and that it is a great company to work for. Depending on management and how they feel about you, that describes your future."
good,"great staff! nice management! good and clean work areas! nice work location! one of the best jobs I had! some what descent schedules."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Home Depot. The managers treated their employees with respect, and viewed them as equals. The hours and pay were good, and there were never any miscommunications between staff members!"
good,I loved working here the employees are great and so was my management team. They adapted well with my school schedule and request for time off. I love the busy environment as well.
good,Home Depot is an international company the treats their employees very well as their philosophy is a happy satisfied employee will offer excellent customer service
good,I have been employed by The Home Depot since 3/06/2017 and the experience has be great.

Thank you for the opportunity to show what  can bring to your company.
good,I really appreciated the extensive customer service training that Home Depot offered.  I liked the diversity of being able to work in several departments while working there.  I loved being able to help customers and solve problems.
good,A good place to get started and move up if you choose.  It feels good to help others.  You can set your availability if you are working part-time and the schedule with go with your availability.
good,This is a great company to start a career in management. They have a leadership program and will guide you to the career you desire. Hours can be inflexible.
good,"Great Company to work for, great benefits, advancement and rowth opportunities. I would recomend to anyone. Live the values and build strong relationships"
good,The associates here are friendly. But management refuses to help associates. They cut OT and hours all the time and are major sticklers for the rules.
good,"it pretty cool working there benifits and pay is great, they just need to work on the managment. the managers need to come together to make one great team everyone just does there on thing"
good,I enjoy working for the company.  You learn a lot and there is always room to cross train.  The hardest part is when there are slow times and hours are not guaranteed.
good,"Great company culture, high ethical standards, and moderate workload.  Still enjoy working here. Great place for Veterans suffering from PTSD because they work with your disabilities."
good,Home Depot is a good place to work with many flexible schedule options to choose from.  At Home Depot you may find yourself handling multiple task.  Overall I rate it as above average place to work.

good,I love the work environment. The associates as well as the managers are all very friendly. There's always something to do. Dress code not as strict as other places. I always feel welcome there.
good,Home Depot was one of the most enjoyable places to work with all the activities they have for employees outside of working. They really cared about their employees.
good,"A typical day at work is 8 hour fast moving customer service. I increased my hardware home center product knowledge daily."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. Definitely more of a career than a place filler. the people are really friendly and can end up being almost like family. However i will say though i was kind of a special case the attendance policies are really not favorable you could call and tell them your going to be late and they still would mark it as an occurrence which is what an infraction on your attendance is called. Also full-time employees do not get overtime unless you have some really pressing financial matters and seriously need it. not to mention the turnover rate for my store was terrible due to mistreatment of the best employees they end up leaving because they get treated like slaves and don't see rewards or promotion unless they are in good with the right people. and to be quite honest most people hate Home Depot and prefer Lowes so customer can be really mean just because A LOT of the time. Overall though if you have strong will power and patience and excellent professionalism and customer service you definitely have found a dream job here at the Depot"
good,"Its a great place to work. Full time employees  are expected to work any shift any hours unless approved by management."
good,"At the home depot  I learned to be an excellent manager and a business owner. I built my crew from the ground. I was in charge of most hiring as well as store trainer. I work in operation and merchandise. He ran successfully the biggest Garden department In the mid Atlantic with a revenue exceeding 28,000,000/ year."
good,Great place to work. Benefits are great but a little expensive. Their people and management are great and they are employee oriented. They promote from within and really seem to care.
good,I worked there Many years ago and loved my job.  The people were great and I learned so very much about home improvement.  It is a great place to work and in a convenient location.
good,the workplace was wonderful and the crew was helpful. The hours were alright since the system being used while I was there was forcing me to work more hours than I could handle while I was a full-time student as well.
good,A typical day at work for a cashier involves a lot of customer involvement. I like the hands on part of the job and we are the last people in the store to leave an impression on customers and that is a big deal.
good,"Loved the set schedule, loved my team at the time, we were like a family. But if you were a hard worker, management did everything in their power to keep you from moving off their team. I wanted to be promoted and the Manager refused to let me further my career because I always made him look great, during his store walks. It got to the point that I had to leave that store just to be promoted.smh"
good,"Fun characters, and cool Management team. Pay is WELL!! Good work hours, the store associate benefits site has good discounts for its employees What more is there to say."

good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at home depot, it was fun, exciting and you are always learning new things about products and customers. Management was amazing there and your overall day goes by fast"
good,"Being a cashier there is not much you can do but to stand around guarding your register. But even just being at the register all day you can learn so much about each department and eventually branch out to different areas of The Home Depot. I worked at the Cedartown Ga Home Depot and frequently go to the Rome Ga, and i can for sure say that all the employees are more than happy to help you and most are very passionate about what they do."
good,"I love the hours and being off on the weekends. There is opportunity on a night team or early mornings so you still have time to be with your family, which i love."
good,"working at The Home Depot was more like a family working on a project together instead of feeling like a work environment. The Store associates and management were great communicators, leaders, and encouraging to help keep you on track and push you through the day, while still having fun from time to time."
good,"Could be managed better. People were placed in leadership positions that lacked some supervisory skills, communication skills and product and policy knowledge."

good,"Es buen trabajo solo que con salario bajo y mucho compromiso con la empresa cual no lo saben valorar"

good,"Sometimes this job makes moving away from my old town feel like a terrible decision. Loved working there. Management needed more ""guidance"", but they made it enjoyable."
good,"Home Depot feels more like a family and less like a workplace. The job is enjoyable most of the customers are straight forward and know exactly what they are looking for they are considered the DIY customers. Then there are the customers that are thankful for your help, those are the customers that I help."
good,The Home Depot was really an outstanding job they gave me amazing opportunities and the management always had my best interest at heart and helped me when i needed it
good,"best job ever. if indeed is going to make me do a review for every single job listed on my resume, then I'm going to be annoyed. cudos to them for gathering data, but at what cost? aggrevating their customers.. not worth it."
good,"HD is extremely busy. I Learned many areas of the depts, Management is fair. Hardest part dealing with unhappy customers. My cashiers make the job fun"
good,Good experience. Not a place if you're looking to grown as a professional. The worst part is that is very difficult to become a full time employee. Management is young but motivated.
good,"THD is the best home improvement store in the country. Their sales associates are taught the proper way to handle all customers, and you feel like home every time you walk in that door."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job and all of my responsibilities. I was certified on all machinery which made me more in demand to pull down merchandise for customers and associates. I had a great working relationship with my co workers. For me the hardest part of the job was having to pick up the slack of less motivated associates, but i feel it helped me grow. My favorite part of the job was making customers happy. I loved working with people and making sure they left with everything they needed for their project."
good,"although management isn't the best, the environment from fellow coworkers is always comforting and makes coming back to work more inevitable and enjoyable"

good,"While working here, I truly felt like a valued member of the company. They offer many ways to promote yourself within the company, and they have an amazing human resource team, and I have never worked for a company with a better workplace culture."
good,"enjoyed job and people I worked with,management very nice and knowleable, worked on computer most of day, hardest part was keeping everyone happy, enjoyable part meeting new people,getting better aquanted with others,no day was ever the same everyday was different"

good,This job is very flexible and willing to work with their employees in order to ensure that they are able to maintain a good work and home life balance.
good,The Home Depot is big on promoting within. All of the Division Managers started as hourly associates. They also focus on training their associates to help them get to the next levels.
good,i had alot of fun working their everyone had great attiudes about what they had to do. i was mostly on a forklift running all aound the warehouse grabbing product all night. the hardest thing about the job was it was a 12hr work day that really drains you on your third day.
good,"Typical Morning and night shift"
good,"I was a  loader, unloader, stocker and it all involved customer service. I enjoyed my job very much. I came back to this area for a better opportunity and to be close to my father."
good,Home Depot is a great company to work for. I learn so much from the company and the associates that work here. Often times I feel that this is more like a family oriented place to work in oppose to a corporation.

good,"Speaking from my entire experience between cashiering and M.E.T. in the Home Depot. I have been with the company since April of 2015, starting off as a cashier and then going to the Merchandising Execution Team in October of 2016."
good,"A busy place most days.  You have to learn a lot of information, sometimes in a short amount of time.  They sometimes do not have enough employees to cover the areas so you have to be open to helping in areas that you might not be as comfortable in.  Patience is needed daily with customers and other associates as well.  The company itself has a great business outlook and means to take care of it's associates.  However, I had experience with several managers who lost site of those goals and was difficult to work under. I miss the people and the way I could help customers, but I do not miss the lack of respect from the management that I was under at the time"
good,This is an ideal job for any student. Management works well with your school hours and there are numerous different outlets to advance within the company.

good,Really good place to work all of the employees make you feel that you are part of a real family environment and they're always reaching out to help whenever possible
good,Hands down favorite place to work. In if your a college student make sure you tell them before hand. If you work hard and learn the material your selling it becomes easier.
good,Honestly its one of the easiest jobs in the world and it has a great environment. Their are a few disadvantages but overall its a great place to work. You still deal with a bit of racism but its not much to look over.
good,"I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores."
good,", Coworkers were friendly and helpful.  Training was very thorough.. I had a another cashier as a coach.  i was never left alone until i felt ready.  The only thing i did not like was standing around waiting for customers. I like to keep busy."

good,"the job was great, at the time I was attending school and needed a later schedule. they were very professional, training was exceptional"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is regulars who requested me specifically. They were doubtful of my ability to load (because of my gender) and then their opinion quickly changed when I would toss a 80lb of Quikrete into their truck!
good,"(Woodlands,Tx) Home Depot offers many amenities and benefits, flexible hours and control of schedule.

good,"I didn't expect to work at Home Depot but I ended up getting a second job there and the experience was great. You work hard, manager recognize that. I lost my grandmother during this time and they were so accommodating and understanding to what was going on. The benefits were surprisingly amazing for full timers and part timers. Learned the in's and out's of working in a garden."

good,Home Depot is a great company to work for and learn a lot of things that could benefit you in your own home. I love helping people create the home of their dreams. Their are some people who work in areas of the store that have no idea about their departments and management doesn't step inn to place them in better areas. The work hours are not consistent for part time employees.
good,Good work environment and good managers. Great for students and young ppl; if you're looking for part time this is the place to work. But for full time employment its difficult to get the position
good,I enjoyed meeting new people everyday.  Co-Workers always made the day go faster.  I stocked and fronted the shelves when needed.  I worked in the lawn and garden department.
good,"working night shifts, with great hours on hand."
good,great company to work for.. good benefits and got along with the customers very well.one of the things is loved about this job that it was a growing company
good,"Cashiering "

good,"Great company, very physically demanding. Great benefits. The home Depot really takes care of their employees. Management is always around. Hardest part of the job is the physicality needed to last."
good,"Es un lugar estable para laborar,"
good,Enjoyed working at HD only left to be a stay at home mom. I loved the people and community I had while working there. I enjoyed the fast pace of every day work.
good,"I got to work at about 5am and my manager and I would clean the bathrooms before we opened up. When we opened up we worked on the other rooms wiping down the machines, the glass, and the walls if needed. I learned not only how to clean certain equipment, but also how to use the equipment as well. The management at the gym was great and was able to set up everything just like clockwork. My coworkers work very hard and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was getting on the big ladders and doing the outside windows in the front. The most enjoyable part of my the job has to be simply running the push broom on the gym floor."
good,"Was very fast paced, and very demanding job, but enjoyed the commerodity of my fellow employees there. Only worked part time nights,so I didn't get any benefits, as this was just a second job at the time,and only done for about nine months."
good,"The Home Depot Contact Center is a great company, with a great team and great benefits. I loved my role as a CHAT specialist!!!"
good,The Home Depot is a Great Place to work but in my position I work Freight and warehouse these positions are part time in season you work about 30 hours but in the off season you only get 18 hours and I can not live on that.
good,good place to work good people fast paced good saleries can move up fast magnement easy customer service number one benefits
good,"Pay was great, loved my co workers and management was good and easy to work with. Had some long nights but was worth it, if you work hard and are reliable you can move up in the company"
good,Home Depot is very employee oriented.  They put alot of time and effort into promoting employees and training.  I have had a good experience with working for them part-time.    The only thing they need improvement on is offering more full-time positions.  They hire many part-time and seasonal workers but the hours are not guarranteed.
good,"A typical day at work to check my emails every morning to ensure every individual request resolved from ""Managers, Auditors, Pro Account Representatives in the field, Finance Team or Legal Department regards to fraud issues surrounding rebates and Gift Card Department for deactivation."
good,"An amazing place to work at, but It's the positive environment is what kept me intrigued in continuing employment with them."
good,"I would go in , speak to the associates and customers I walked by . Collets carts , help customers and get propane tanks.I would take breaks and talk to coworkers and made good friends with some customers . The co workers and the managers were cool . The hardest part about this job is that I would have to do everything within a matter of time sometimes by myself . The best part about the job was the christmas par tie and we would have days where people bring in food ; you can't go wrong with free food"
good,"Customers and Co workers motivates you to enjoy the time, managers care about how are you doing and how your feeling.  "
good,"The work is fast pace and mostly done in an individual setting. The Managers often walk by and check you, your pace, your comprehension of the work you are doing etc. The hardest part of the job is being accurate but after training its a breeze. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and people you work with. They make work a fun place and the energy is positive."
good,"I have been working at The Home Depot for almost four months now. I started late March/early April (it is currently early July), and I have never enjoyed going to work more. The Home Depot makes everyone feel like family. Within the first two weeks I was there I was on a first name basis with every other employee and had a solid relationship with over half of them. A typical day (as a cashier) consists of clocking on and heading to your Head Cashier to see where you will be (Garden Cahiser, Contractors, etc.). It's more than just standing around and waiting for customers. You have to be willing to go out of your way to ask customers if they need help finding anything, how their day was, etc. As a cashier, you are the first and last person the customer is in contact with. The way you make them feel is very important. I have only had a few problems when it comes to management, however most of those were do to me being misinformed (or not informed at all) and since then have been taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my job at The Home Depot is the company itself. I have never worked in a place where it feels like home due to the soul fact that everyone is family. I have my favorite cashiers I enjoy working with, my favorite Garden Associates I always call on for help outside, my best friend I met in lumber who is always willing to go out of his way to help, and so many more. Overall, The Home Depot does a brilliant job of putting customers first, and making work feel like a walk in the park."
good,A typical day starts with inventory preparation followed by opening .Customers are than the priority. The hardest part of the job are the holiday weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with their projects.
good,Comfortable working environment. I had a wonderful time with them and left them very pleased and satisfied with my performance. Brilliant team and Collaborative Client counterpart.
good,"un día típico en la empresa es trabajo duro con vocación y satisfacción de la mano de compañeros encargados gerentes y lo mas importante los clientes, la parte mas difícil es la promociones para mejores puestos mu lentas pero aprendes a competir sanamente para lograr objetivos marcados por el grupo de trabajo y personales"
good,"I enjoy my co-workers,they make the day better. My manager is the best I have ever worked for. My day consists of checking pricing and planograms with customer service as a must."
good,"The manager in Oak Harbor, Will hired me on, everybody got a chance to move up in the company, be to work on time, do your job and you will. Lots of awesome people I met came out of that store."
good,Adding subtracting filing stamping payment. Not to go in debt. Supervisor was ok co-workers awesome. Hardest part was when it closed down. Working and hanging with my co-workers.
good,I've enjoyed learning and growing as a professional with Home Depot.  It's the one place that allows people to be who they are without discrimination and without micro-management.

good,Prepare to be on your feet for the entire shift and lifting tools or equipment for customers. You will be shuffled to different departments depending on how busy the store is.
good,"I enjoyed working at the Home Depot and have considered returning. My first store was the best. Some of the others weren't quit measurable as far as pleasant atmosphere and attitude toward associates but the company as a whole is a good one to work for. I recommend them highly. If you work hard, most of them will recognize you. A few do have their little clicks of favorites no matter how hard you work but the one in Panama City, Florida that is away from the beach was the best!"
good,A typical day at work consists of providing customer service first because customers are the most important.Another part of my day is helping stocking and putting products  on the shelves. I also help recovering the store when it is closed by fixing the issues and the products that were misplaced by the customers.
good,Good job While i was in college. Fun place to work good people to work with.  Give you the opportunity to learn new things about the product.
good,"The home Depot is a good company While working there i learned how to give great customer service skills. i've learned to work a cash register, stock shelves and work in a fast pace environment."
good,"I would walk the store in search of customers doing home improvements. I would talk to at least 100 people a day. I learned that not every person is a lead no matter how persuasive. Management was given free reign. My co-workers were amazing and helpful. The hardest part of this job was leaving. Home Depot was my ""home."" The most enjoyable part of this job was the freedom to interact with EVERY customer."
good,"They give employee's stock options and 401K's"

good,"I enjoy helping the customer find what they need and providing them with the excellent customer service they deserve. I've learned so much just looking up and down the isles and that has helped me succeed in up selling our products and services. Coming into Home Depot and seeing your co workers every time feels like family. The hardest part of working in Home Depot may be when you have to say ""sorry we don't carry it in stores, you have to order online"" and looking at the customer's disappointment because they have to wait. Thru out time I've learned that we can't satisfy every customer but I've learn to change that frown into a smile and never let a customer leave unhappy.I enjoy coming into work and being greeted with a smile and a joyful attitude."
good,the environment make you want to come to work everyday. the people you work with make it like that. everyone has each other back. great environment will beat a great paying job all day.
good,"I took this job to get me out of the house and talking to people while I looked for a full time position. "
good,Overall the Home Depot is a good place to work and I only wish that I could have continued on there. Unfortunately I was part of a downsizing.
good,I spent almost a year with the home depot as a part time employee. The day was different every time as they moved me around from department to department. But the culture of the store was always phenomenal. When I left for school I transferred to a different Home Depot store and found that the same held true. The most enjoyable part about going to work was that the people there are always friendly and willing to help out. Management was consistently understanding in even the most bizarre of circumstances. Most of the higher ups had began as sales associates so the company grows organically. The entire corportation truly felt and acted like a family.
good,"I got along great with everyone here. It was easy to transition into a new job because the family orientation of the company. This job was not hard all, everyone around me made my new job and easy one to learn."
good,"A normal day at home depot is busy but not so stressful. The management is okay, they will work with you and help you out but its up to you if you want to learn more things around home depot.The hardest part of the job were having customers upset because they weren't able to find what they came in for. I always want my customers happy and get everything they need."

good,"El salario es muy escaso considerando que no tenemos cafetería ni transporte."
good,Dedicated to team work and high production.  Focus on Safety and the Happiness of the GWA's.  Monthly meeting to review the state of the company and earnings.  Associate recognition through the world wherever there are Home Depots.   Good stock options.  Reward with food.
good,I left lowes to come to home depot you work consistently but id more seasonal. Slower in winter fast paced in the summer a good mix where you never get bored
good,The management team is very supportive. It is a great company to work for.  We always make sure that our customer come first and their time spent at our store an enjoyable one.
good,I have always loved Home Depot until I started to work there. The hours sucks and I never had help from other co-works. I was always put in the position of being a manager but was never promoted.
good,me agrada el luegar de trabajo por compañeros y jefes ya que gerencia pendiente trato y atencion a clientes venta de productos asi como del cobro de la misma apoyo a supervisores de cajas asi como a jefes en su area
good,"Learnt projection execution and handing over"
good,"Working here was one of the best jobs I've ever worked and that includes my military service. I was paid an actually practical wage and was given hours whenever I required them. Anytime I required time off it was usually granted. The management treated you like a person rather than a tool they could easily discard. They were always there to help even if it meant actually geting their own hands dirty. If you needed something they were there. That goes for the coworkers as well. Always there to help with a task, advice, or whatever it is that you need help with. The only hard part about the job I would say was the loading and unloading. Occasionally customers would buy items that were pretty heavy even for someone like me who loaded and unloaded the entire day sometimes. But coworkers were always there to help. The most enjoyable part I'd have to say was the all this plus they still believe in the Sunday time and a half tradition. This has gone the way of the dodo bird lately in corporations but it seems The Home Depot will continue to be a true model for successful business practices. Thank you for the proper job experience. I'll never forget working for this company. The company I've made the most I've ever made in income, ever."
good,Present high quaility candidates to Store leaders; Ensure that rapid course correction are made for any indentified process improvement; Partner with Store Leaders and DHRM to ensure staffing processes and explore employment marketing strategies

A typical day at work includes engaging with helpful management teams, helping customers solve problems, and learning about new products."
good,"A typical day at work would be me greeting all customers coming in to the store, asking them if they needed any help with anything. I learned the names of a lot of items in the store like drills, types of drywall, types of light bulbs, the sizes of screws, etc. The management there was okay I guess. They never really talked to the cashiers. My co workers were amazing I loved them all. They made going to work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was not being able to answer a question I didnt know the answer to. I enjoyed almost everything, I loved the customers since they were very frequent I learned their names, I also loved how we had two 15 min breaks during every shift. I loved how they rewarded the cashiers with pins for every good survey."
good,"I loved working at The homedepot, the people, management, and the CEO were amazing. The overall attitude of the employees is very awesome."
good,"Great company to work for, and management is excellent.  Standing on concrete floors is the worst, but I am getting used to it.  Breaks should be given every two hours or if it's a short shift like 5 or 6 hours, the break should be given at the halfway mark, not past."
good,"I have learned a lot of skills and trades, but I have also lost my position 3 times because the company phased out the positions, I am reduced to going backward in my career and I want to move forward and learn more"
good,Great place to work and thats where i learned all of my skills from. I learned great customer service skills and selling skills.
good,"While doing our jobs, we had contests. The contests would be simple, like, if you sold a certain dollar amount of a certain product, you would get like a $25 gift certificate to Home Depot or another local store."

good,"Great place to work "
good,Home Depot is a company of many opportunities.  The company rewards you for your job effort and that encourages you to do better.  Wish they had full time positions but overall very fun place to work in.
good,"At this job, everyone worked as a team. We all helped each other out during work and outside of work as well. There was a ""Homer Fund"" that I thought was really cool, it was something to help out an associate in need, the fellow employees would donate or raise funds and Home Depot would match that amount. I have never known any other job to do something like that for each other."
good,"Usually high paced job with hundreds of customers. Not always well stuffed with full time associates during the holiday season, but very tolerable otherwise. Great place for growth and advancement. Really great bunch of old timers. However after 45 years of working full time I needed to slow down, unwind a little bit and after several months to return as part time associate. I fill to energetic and in to good shape for full retirement. I'm ready for many more years of service."

good,had a good time work there . but mg suck i cashier stock gave good  service to the people made some good friends the co workers was good but mangement suck
good,great place to work and great to intermingle with customers .great working with staff but needs a little manager aspect.
good,"A great place to work. The training was very useful, the co-workers were pleasant and helpful, but the toughest part of the job was dealing with dishonest customers who would change prices on merchandise or disclosed smaller items in larger boxes etc."

I unloaded the Vendors trucks while running back and forth throughout the day helping customers with questions and loading all the heavy items they would buy.

good,"I enjoyed working with the public, customer interactions and more so with my cashiers, head cashiers and lot associates that I were under my supervision.  The hardest part was accountability for those 28 associates supervised under my supervision due to my also being coverage on the floor as well as the front end."

good,nice fun environment to work in but comes with to much drama for a job i liked everything but just a few things bothered me i spoke about it nothing was done so i did the adult thing gave in my 2 weeks
good,I enjoyed starting the day early stocking and helping coworkers as well as customers.  There is always new product to learn about in home improvement.

good,Co-workers along with the staff were easy to get along with and very helpfull.

Everyone you work with is serious about the work they do, and at the same time they're all very relaxed and bring tons of fun to the workplace. A lot of what goes on in our store is because of management, they do whatever they can to make the workplace relaxed and just fun, with small contests each day for a gift card to giving out in store awards that can be redeemed when you get a certain amount over to free lunches when the store does well. One of the harder parts with the job is the fast paced environment, but at the same time it's one of the more enjoyable parts as it helps time go by quicker."

I've learned how to drive every machine that Home Depot has to offer in-store. Management has always been laid back and understanding, as well as co-workers. Home Depot is a very diverse work environment with the people you work with. The hardest part of my job is juggling all of my tasks whilst in the spring time rush when we are receiving 5+ trucks a week. The best part of my job is that I have a fun and engaging work place."

I enjoyed the chances to help people and the general community among my coworkers, my particular location had the difficulty of multiple managers telling you how to do the same things very different ways, but something always was worked out."
good,A typical day at work is working a 9 hour shift. When I come in automatically get to work. I ask customers what project they are working on and how could I help. Usually most are very pleasant and some times we have those customers who are not.

good,"I enjoyed working here, the co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. The only thing I didn't enjoy was that it was a seasonal position, and you didn't know if they were going to keep you until you were close to ending your 120 days. If they weren't keeping you then your schedule would come up blank, no warning, no manager spoke to you about it, nothing."
good,"A typical day at work for me at the home depot is generally a good one. Your  have great co workers who are not only their to support you at work but at home; Actually something like an extended family when I think about it.  I have grown so much working with this company that its kind of refreshing and insightful as I recall. I have learned how to be professional in situation that may be hard, how to conduct myself business wise, and how to separate  the business life from work life. The hardest part of my job would be having what i call ""that difficult conversation"" with an employee you know is capable of doing better, but hey it has to be done. The most enjoyable part is being to self reflect on that great time you built and ""man we did awesome""."

good,Typical day is taking care of the stores and merchants.  I have been with Home Depot for 17 years and have learned alot in those years.  My co-workers are nice people to work with.  I have become long friends with some of them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing we help the customers and well as our store employees.
good,"I loved working there for the last 15 years. I learned so much about business management, customer service, store appearance. I think most of all I learned that I am capable of accomplishing so much in such a short amount of time, by using the great relationships that I had developed with my associates. I loved my co-workers. I should because I hired most of them. I tried to surround myself with the best. The hardest part of my job was probably keep up with the in-stock status in a remote store. I was so important to my customers that had driven for 100 plus miles to find the product that they came in for. I learned that by keeping the on-hands correct that the auto replenishment would take care of the rest. This job took care of me and my family for over 15 years. I am very appreciative of The Home Depot."

good,"The Home Depot in Harrison, AR is highest in district sales. The reason for this is customer satisfaction. With highly trained and informative associates, customers began to respect and rely on our product knowledge. Not only that, but we were able to recognize and solve many customer dilemmas. This put our management, associates and front desk clerks in a unique position. No longer thought of by the public as simple hardware employees, but rather, knowledgeable and highly respected by homeowners and local contractors."

good,they cared about their employees and their customers and they would show us their appreication.
good,"this job is great for a young adult  you get lots of experience in such parts you need for other future jobs  like costumer service, sales, merchandsing, you learn how to operate machines on your own ."
good,"The Home Depot is an amazing place to work. Almost everyone is very nice and there to help. The primary benefit in my opinion is the opportunity for growth. They say sky is the limit but i disagree. Astronauts proved us wrong by landing on the moon. What i mean for this is that even if you work your way up to be a store manager, the is still room to grow into corporate Home Depot. The job life itself can be quite vigorous especially on Saturdays' Power Hours. Though the job can be  vigorous, the benefits are outstanding. I would definitely recommend somebody with an interest in any of our departments to take the first step and apply."
good,Go in and get assigned an isle to work on.  Complete daily tasks as outlined.
good,I have always enjoyed working at Home Depot. As a sales associate there is no typical day. The customers that come into the store have positive attitudes for the most part. The management team here is one of the best I have seen. They are always willing to support the associates and give guidance to keep the business running smoothly.
good,"A typical day started with morning stretches, this was a mandatory safety precaution. Afterwards there would be assignments handed out and each person had their own department to work in ,unless there was a project for which two or more people we're needed. I learned that different companies had different setups for their products and that customers came first always! Manangement was very good always there to help if there was something I was'nt sure about. My coworkers we're great ,as they we're very helpful also.The hardest part of the day was getting up at 3:30 am, I had to be to work at five! Once I got to work ,the whole day was enjoyable,I really like working with people. And I do love customer service!"
good,"The best way to explain is that no two days at Home Depot are the same. Everyday you face new challenges with new and returning customers. I have learned and continue to learn a lot in the environment here, from the classes I take to hands on training in the workplace. I constantly learn new management and customer service relationship skills. I always try to take care of and train my employees the best I can, as well as learn from them, I strongly agree that everyone has knowledge to share. The hardest part of my job is maintenance, I can get any place into a good or great organization or improve on a existing one, but keeping everyone to want to keep up constant maintenance is key to a successful business and its always something to keep up with in my mind. I very much enjoy working with customers and helping them complete their rojects or sharing knowledge, or maybe just going the extra 10% to make their visit memorable to get lifetime customers."
good,"Very personable"
good,"I enjoyed working with home depot due to the environment. They consistently keep in contact you and keep you on track. I have learned many things with home depot.

Management and co-workers are amazing to be around, and they are always there for support. I never really felt that there was a hard part of the job.

Most enjoyable would be being able to communicate with everyone around you as well as customers and being able to help them."

good,"In the garden department of The Home Depot there are many things that we have to do in a typical day of work. This includes but is not limited to rotating product, learning about products, and the most important is customer service. We strive to make every customer feel welcome and appreciated. My co-workers work together great as a team and we get jobs done quickly and effectively. The hardest part of working at The Home Depot is not being able to always help every customer because of the amount of business that we receive. The most enjoyable part is satisfying customer needs and getting positive feedback from them."
good,A typical day at work was making sure all merchandise is stocked. i learned a lot about garden products. My management were always motivated and i loved there enthusiasm. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was to make an already angry customer happy. The most enjoyable part was making someone smile when they were having a bad day.
good,"Helping customers, changing prices, and helpig my coworkers"

good,"Easy to clock in and get ready for work. My job description was simply to help out any customers and associates with any loading/ unloading of certain products. There will be times where I have to do other jobs as to pull and pick orders for customers, will-call, and online orders. Co-workers were very supportive, positive, and willing to help out whatever the case maybe. The management was really good, if any problems occurred they are willing to listen and get the issue resolved. The only difficult thing about the job was getting a hold of other associates in certain departments for assistance. Overall the job was basic and simple, I really enjoyed myself being a employee there at the Home Depot."
good,"Typical day at work consists of walking the store and assessing the standards and in-stock so we are ready for the customer.

During the time of work I learned to expand a positive attitude to customers and have a friendly atmosphere.The management was lenient when not busy, but strict when it was busy. The hardest part of the job was to lift heavy items to and from the main desk. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with different people and making a comfortable and friendly environment for them. Also, learning about their projects they will perform, allowed a close relationship to build."

good,"Home Depot was a good place to work. I liked it because I love helping and meeting different people. My co workers at home depot made the job fun. They brought food to work, parties, and more food. The hardest part of the job was the hot sun in the summer time. It gets very hot in Florida especially when your a lot attendant pushing carts.

Theres always something to do when working there like fill in the wholes on the shelf or help customers find what they need right away.

good,Meeting my goals at work is my passion. I love to help a co worker to get jobs done for the betterment of my organization.

good,"fun enviorment, excellent training, reasonable with your flexibility"
good,"I loved the job,everyone is friendly and ready to assist customers"
good,"These days they use a lot of part time employees, which I see as ruining the company.  When I worked there, we had lots of full time people there, who seemed to pour their heart out for the common goal of customer satisfaction.  At least speaking for myself, and many other fellow associates who worked there when I did.  I learned that customers love to be treated as though they are family, and like to be called on a first name basis when possible.  My typical day at work was interesting to say the least, while performing my repairs, ordering parts for these repairs, helping customers find what they need and then some.  Most of the people I worked with were hard workers and self-sufficient.  The hardest part of the job was having to say goodbye at the end of the work day.  It is/was an enjoyable place to work at.  I was up every morning before the sun rose, even on my days off!  That is how much I loved my work.  At least twice I showed up for work on my days off accidentally, and that in of itself says volumes.  My mistake was that I thought I could begin my own business of repairs, but the failing economy ruined that idea.  We were paid well, and no overtime policy made it more tolerable as none of us had to work more than 8 hours a day, or 40 hours in week."
good,awesome co-workers and supervisors. I learned to cashier and manage money
good,multiple ways  to learn & grow with the company & incouragement to do so.

good,"This was one of my most favorite company's to work for! This company is very safety conscious, and promotes from within. I feel the company could learn how to value employees better if you have an issue with another co-worker. I feel that is because Customer service associates are So easy to get. It broke my heart to quit this company but I would definitely apply there again."

good,"A typical day at work consist of offering customer service to our customers when they walk into the store, making sure the customer find shopping easy during their visit. By helping a customer sometimes you learn more about a product by seeking for more information to give back to the customers. The hardest part of this job is dealing with angry customers. As soon they walk they have an attitude and want you to find their product quick."
good,"I worked as a cashier and helped with customer service. I ran the front end which meant I had to clean, stock and prepare the store to look as neat and cleaned as possible. I helped stock shelves and even at times would help load items in the back of someone's vehicle."

good,"waking up early and arriving to work at 6 a.m in the morning is what i would do at the home depot. And always being on time, to start my work day as a cashier. As a cashier i would come in contact with almost everyone that came into the store. Which meant i was the last person they saw. As a cashier it was my job to make sure the costumer was satified with there visit, if not i was more than willing to help them out experiance a satifying visit.

good,"I worked many different positions at the home depot.  From Shipping and receiving, to inventory management, right into merchandising, it was a good company to work for.  Some managers favored a certain group of employees, while other managers would favor those who worked their shift to the best of their ability and showed up on time each day.  A handful of co workers are still good friends of mine to this day, and I still visit them from time to time.  the most desirable part of the job was the people I worked with, and some of the tasks that I had to perform.  Was into the whole shipping and receiving aspect of The Home Depot, definitely wish they paid more."

good,"I was a cashier, assisted customers and handled payments. Had a wide variety of customers, from get the necessities to buy everything do it yourselfers.The store manager and hr were awesome in flexibility of scheduling and working with associates with home issues.

good,Not a bad job i am just working there part time while i am going to school and not only is the environment great but so is the management team!
good,"I started in the flooring department and although I didn't know anything about it; I found the job to be fun and challenging. Flooring being a speciality department, my sales were tracked on a daily and monthly basis. I was always the top sales associate for 9 months. I was then promoted to department supervisor over the paint department."
good,The co-workers are probably the most supportive people I have worked with in any agency. The company as a whole is very good and they do alot of community service.

good,It is a fun place to work. The other employees are nice and make you feel good. The hours are great and they work around your school schedule very easy. I would enjoy getting paid more though. It is difficult to pay bills with 25 hours a week at $9 an hour.
good,Productive and fun workplace with a diversified selection of employees. Great interaction between employees and upper management.  Family atmosphere. 
good,Completing projects in accordance to plan-o-gram and corporate standards. Critical thinking and planning to ensure integrity to complete projects in allotted time. Friendly yet professional atmosphere with hard working co-workers. 
good,"A typical day at work would consist of down stocking. During ""power hours"" usually 9a-2p strict customer service no tasking. After 2 shelf maintenance begins. Management really depends on the store. Some are strict by the book tough managers, and some are really fun to work with and cool but still professional managers. Co workers are usually easy to get along with, the home depot has a family type environment. Sometimes goals are hard to meet, and some customers are hard to deal with but for the most part a good place to work."

good,"Typical day consists of interacting with customers and helping them find what they need or give them advice for their own home improvement projects. It also involves down stocking shelves and making sure the store appearance is neat, clean and organized. I have learned valuable skills in communication, organization and time managament by working at the home depot. I feel that the management skills of the managers is not the most efficient especially in HR in scheduling employees. I feel some managers pick favorites and assign employees they do not like or are new harder work then others. The hardest part of the job is running back and forth helping customers, in addition to carrying heavy boxes multiple times up and down a ladder. The most enjoyable part about this job is when you find the product that the customer is looking for and they are satisfied and you are thanked for helping them. "
good,Fast pace at times. Fun and friendly people to work with. Benefits are not the best though. Cookouts and hangouts days. They also do community services as a store.

good,Great company. Great values and culture. I loved and working for home depot. What i learned there will forever be utilize at future jobs and everyday task that i perform. Management was ok. Didnt give much as far as advancing within the management field. Lots of empty promises. Overall a great place to work at.
good,"Home Depot was a fun and exciting way to learn new things about products, it was also good to use my good communication skills"
good,After punching I walk my dept. looking for issues that ned to be addressed. Then set a work list for myself and associates for that day. After this is done I go back pull my stats for the previous day and for the week checking for areas that need attion.Igo back to the floor do customer service while work on tasks that Ihave found or those given to me by my managers.Meanwhile handeling other issues in the store as they arise and within my job discription.

good,I belive when I work there was one of the best companies I work for with no pressure and they were always willing to give you the tools to do your duties. Problem I'd did not see the oppurtunity for advancement in the company
good,"Rewarded for meeting quotas, You work in a set of multiple locations. Some times the store personell offsets what you fixed and you have to do it all over again but that creates job security. overall good place"
good,"The employees are great! They're all like family. It's a lot fun to interact with customers and makes the day go by quicker. It's a very informative job, I work in three different departments so I'm always learning."
good,"Open and close of department, helping customers in my area and thoers, placing orders, stocking shelves and running fork lifts"
good,An accounting office where approx 40-50 women worked (approx 4 men) and we all got along very well. I was hired to do a 2 week year-end project that turned out to be a position I was able to hold onto for 9 months until the company consolidated and moved the office to another state...the management was very open to teaching me things and giving me opportunity to try and learn new and different programs. The hardest part of my job was being laid off after becoming so close to the people i had worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work everyday expecting to learn something new and exciting!
good,"Opportunities for interaction with other motivated, diversified peers and customers. Management, sales staff and support work together daily to reach the common goal of customer service and satisfaction. Endless opportunities to expand knowledge base in systems, products and services. Growth and advancement opportunities available for those with the aspiration and desire for such. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable: Making and maintaining a satisfied customer base and growing that base on a daily basis."
good,Typical day at work:
good,"great place to work, nice caring co workers and managers. Great learning and growing opportunity."
good,My typical day is traveling to the stores in my district to support the store leadership in all areas of HR. I have learned that working for Home Depot is being part of a family. The management teams live by the company values and ensure their leaders do too. My co-workers are very supportive and work together well for the success of our business. The hardest part of my job is being able to get to my stores each week. The district between some of the stores I support is far so I am not able to give the support I would like to. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with.
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing excellent customer service/satisfaction, ensuring each customer is greeted, is helped with any uncertainties, and leaves the store happy. It is also to be consistently cleaned and to help out other associates. For example, if a cashier has a long line, another cashier will be sent to help decrease the line."

good,"Home Depot has allowed me to regain my work skills, and help pay my bills, management is good, and understanding."
good,"Every night we all gathered with our manager and talked and was briefed on the night. Everyone had a job, a section, or was helping someone if they needed it. Plenty of times people had to come to my section, Garden, because there was always so much because of the summer. But, whenever there was a slow night in my section there i was always willing to help someone else out. If i was not in Garden i was in Lumber, Bed, Bath, Flooring, or lights."

good,Assisting customer on the daily basics with special order .
good,"Whenever i was at work, so many people would be friendly. I learned how to manage a cash register and help customers throughly. The coworkers were all very friendly and helpful. The only hard part about the job was having to load things when needed, and having to do it without being trained."
good,Working daily to drive profitability and provide excellent customer services.
good,loved the job and its was busy place to work. co-workes were friendly and helpful to sale. management was understanable too with every siutuatuin that employee had.
good,Fun and friendly co workers...Very helpful staff.....Clean enviorment...Able to find assitance quickly...
good,"A typical day at work starts with me writing schedules for the entire store keeping in line with company and legal guidelines. I update all training that needs to be completed for that week and follow up with all supervisors to ensure it is done. I track all associates attendance and issue letters as needed. I organize and maintain all employee files so they are up to date. I am a hard worker and enjoy working with a team but can work independently if needed. I am dependable, dedicated and get along with everyone."
good,Enjoy everyday at work. Not enough money to live off of though.
good,"Good enviroment, nice managment, opportunity for advancment can be good."
good,Nice pace flow job.
good,"sale, rental of a tool change out a plug. change a belt.just help people to understand, hey thats, it"

good,Great place to learn customer service. Promotes from with-in.
good,"I dealt a lot with customer issues. I worked in every single department, from millworks, pro desk, Returns to Vendors, customer service, etc. I loved dealing with people everyday and the hardest part would be when we were busy and I was being pulled to several locations, but I am a good multitasker."
good,Over all working for home depot was a great experience everyday I learned something which made work challenging and fun. The managers and co workers were always eager to help you if needed.
good,"Great place to work at, everyone is treated like family and we love taking care of the customers"
good,"A typical day at work for me is 5am - 1:30, some days I would have to shelf maintenance the bays, front face product and other days would be a total reset on the bay, adding and replacing tags, mark downs, down stock, empty trasha nd keep the place a safe enviornment. I learn a lot from day to day. With each department it is always something new to learn, whether it is helping a customer or a vendor presenting a PK (Product Knowledge). Management for the most part is good, some are fair others are not. Overall my management is fair. The hardest part of my job I would say are the customers. I enjoy helping them but sometimes it can be difficult because you may not know something or try to get someone else to help them. They believe if you work there you must know everything and that is not the case. The Home Depot is VERY big on Customers First. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the work goals done by the end of your day. If the work is completed, your happy, your supervisor is happy, therefore your boss is happy and the company is being handled as it should."
good,"great place to work, great benefits, balance home/work"
good,"A lot of standing and walking, but a good company to work for."
good,Well skilled workers a place you can learn new things about products the best part of it all is helping a customer that was well satisfied with my customer service.
good,"i love working for home depot, the people i work with are outstanding, and i want to further my carrer there"
good,8 hour shifts
good,i loved my co-workers it was a very easy going work enviornment.
good,"When you walk into work, everyone greets you with a hello and a smile. I really learned that you can enjoy retail work and that we are all team players there. Management really has our backs and is there to listen and help when needed. My co-workers are all excellent and team-players. The hardest part of the job is the changes in management, they never stay for long periods of time and the varies schedule changes. I love working with people, just making them feel that we are thankful for their business, because without them, we wouldn't have jobs."
good,Met a lot of nice people (both customers and staff). Enjoyed my time there.
good,"sometimes I would come in at 4:00 in the morning and do the morning baking.in the afternoons I would supervise staff,I would do prep for the next morning.Supervise afternoon staff, cleaning. Cash out tills and close the store."
good,They gave good hours but the benefits were poor for part timers.
good,"Working in a fast paced high volume retail stores. Typical day at work is focused on employee relationships, excelling in customer service and driving sales. As a store manager there is a high focus on P&L and improving profitability through gross margin."
good,There are many jobs at the Home Depot RDC. Many jobs to fit any individual. There is a lot of sorting and stacking and moving of freight across the large warehouse and there is a good management team in place to make sure it all runs smoothly. The things I like about Home Depot is that it is a huge company but the values that they hold here go further than just the stores and warehouses. I really like that they try to help as many people as they can in and out of the business. The people who work here love their jobs and are knowledgeable about the processes. The hardest part of any day at Home Depot RDC is the demands of the job like lifting and moving freight that is large and awkward.
good,working for the home depot was a very good experience it felt like i was immediately accepted into the team like environment.
good,"Shifts vary, and time off, when asked for in advance, isn't very hard to obtain. Transferring between departments, and advancing upward isn't difficult for those of whom are hard workers."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work and pays very well. If it weren't for the lure of making more money somewhere else I would not have left.
good,Home Depot is a place with great opportunites and always room to grow if I could get employed yet again I'd hop on the oppurtunity ASAP.
good,"Generally a different schedule each day, and part-time, however working at a retail store I was able to experience the fast-pace customer service provided and gained a lot more respect for employees in many stores. Having something to do throughout most of the day makes it go by that much faster. The downfall is not knowing half of the products in your department and trying to explain it to customers generously anyway. Many coworkers throughout the store would try to help, but they tended to be just as busy. The best part about it was when you were able to help a customer and were able to help them find what they came in to buy. The hardest part was trying to find the knowledge to help customers and helping multiple customers at once."
good,Big box company dedicated to awesome customer service. I learned tremendous skills in regard to retail inventory and profit and loss. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning and training my employees and fellow managers. The most difficult was the total availability schedule that made it difficult to be able to balance work/life.
good,I loved being a cashier and getting to interact with the customers
good,"A typical day at the home depot is very laid back , we were a very slow store but there was always light work to be done"
good,Always providing good customer services
good,I would come into work and we would have over 1000 invoices from all of the mid west home depot stores (maintenance dept) from the work that was done on the stores from fork lift repairs to leaks to parking lot repairs they would be sent to the corporate building and I would have to enter all of them each day with one other lady. I liked everyone I worked with is was a fun place to work. still again there was not a hard part of my job. when I go to work I like what I do and enjoy it.
good,I loved working for Home Depot. They were very much about advancing and getting knowledge under your belt.
good,Very good management and training system. Very well organized
good,"I'm a hardworker,who goes the extra mile to get the job done,I'm also very reliable,willing to work overtime in needed,work on my days off,etc"
good,Always willing and able to greet and help customers with their projects and concerns. Describe how merchandise will benefit customers needs. Applied my knowledge in the main. field for over 15 years to help customers solve any issues they may be experiencing and give them a solution that will fit with what they are dealing with.
good,Homedepot is a great company to work for that really puts the emphasis on the associates that work in the stores. The work is strenuous but compensation is fair. Job security is average and they believe in promoting from within first.
good,"good company to work for, positive work environment, customers expect you to know what your talking about and not guess, training is needed of you every month to keep up to date on company policy and safety, staff can be limited at certain times of year because of sales, be expected to learn more then one department and be flexible with where and who you work with on a daily basis"
good,"Duringf the Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank era, This was the best company to work for. Your hard work was noticed. Advancement was based on work performance, It was a fun work environement."
good,"Great culture of people, Great staff. Sad that we got laid off. Miss the people."
good,"I loved working at Home Depot! I did not care for the changing of managers so frequently. When one manager got to know your excellence, another one came in and I had to prove myself over and over again to retain my position."
good,"I have been with The Home Depot almost 13 years. Work and fun together is a good environment to be in. Customer service is huge!! Great culture and supportive surrounding, like family."
good,"Within a year that I've been working here, I've learned to take things easy. Step by step and don't be hard on myself. I've managed to balanced out school and work."
good,Attendance is one of the most important part of advancement and the company trains you for promotions with in. There is both online and hands on training by the staff.
good,The only reason I'm looking for a new job is because I need fulltime with benefits and a day time shift and they can't offer me that. Said I'd have to start with closing shifts and that's impossible for me to do.
good,They are a great company to work with. Look out for the employees. Regular lunch and breaks given. Monthly meetings for employees. Great advancement opportunities given to employees who work hard
good,Was blessed to work at a great location with a great team & management. Offers good benefits for full time employees but was the lowest paying overnight job I've ever had and they definitely have the revenue to pay their overnight staff a good bit more to say the least.
good,Employees are provided with flexible hours and decent starting pay.  Training for forklifts and other machinery are available by request but are most by lumber and lot associates.
good,"Is a great place to work, with a lot of "
good,great place to work part time. Vacation days and sick time are offered. The management team is very flexible with part time schedules and will work with the employee for certain requests.
good,Great place as a first job. Plus if you have ever shopped at home depot . Fun culture . Great co-workers. Very diverse. On the job expanded training. A+
good,Es un lugar donde conoses mucha gente con actitudes buenas y que te ayudan acrecrecer mas como persona y aseguir progresando economicamente
good,"Highlight of working here is the people are always interesting, coworkers especially. Many are ex-military and older. Frequently switch between various roles if nightshift; but nothing unreasonable."
good,"Working at Home Depot was a great time for me, I wish I was still there. The employees at Skyview power center HD are very supportive, and hard working people, they truly proved it to me by showing me their work ethic and kindness. I hope to go back someday soon. So if you have the chance to work at Skyview Home Depot take it, even if it is temporary it will be good for you in the end."
good,"After only being there a short few months, they really made me feel like family. I had never had a job like that before. Would recommend anyone gladly."
good,I am the opener for the service desk or hardware department.  There is many opportunity for learning new information.  The management is usually very supportive.  Home Depot does many things for their employees.  The hardest in my job is not being able to find merchandise that we are suppose to have in stock.  The most enjoyable part of my is helping customers.
good,Focus on your given tasks and everything is great. They really appreciate someone who actually works and does the work. I recommend it as a strong second job or part time job.
good,"Home depot, is very flexible around work hours. They work with based on availability to better accommodate workers needs."
good,I was able to transfer to a different store to help me grow in the company. There is plenty of opportunity to cross train in different departments. Lots of help from your peers and supervisors.
good,"Obtain a strong work place maintaining positive structure with employee "
good,It was a learn as you go training atmosphere.  You are always doing different job with minimal supervision.  It was an enjoyable place to work and there was always a positive atmosphere.
good,"No one job is secure"
good,"Expectations regarding consistency and performance are somewhat high, some positions whose standards are higher than others, but I believe that's the best part of this job. THD encourages every associate to be the best they can be, and even offer promotional opportunities frequently. Customer and associate safety is a top priority within the store, and such is well-executed. Benefits are great, management is kind, caring and blooming with personality, and is also willing to work with the associate, whether it be employee development, seeking better opportunities, and will even talk personally to offer solutions to personal matters that may be troubling the associate. I've very much enjoyed the overall experience working for this company!"
good,Worked there for a little while allot of lazy people pay was good for the 3 days I worked a week managers really sucked but the work wasn’t to fast more really slow was sent home early allot other than that was an okay place to work
good,You learn a lot about teamwork and how to become a leader not just at work and on everyday life. The environment it great as well as the staff. Sometimes it can get hot inside the trailers
good,My experience with supervisors and management has only been positive and motivating. Home Depot truthfully lives by there core values and treats everyone with compassion and understanding.  I have been very impressed with the company. It is apparent that the company cares for his employees.
good,"Will often do task needed around the store, not always specific to your department, but it gives a sense of freedom and flexibility in a work environment. The company values employee happiness just as much as the customer's and ensure you are taken care of and looked after."
good,I was just hired at The Home Depot in my hometown after a series of fifteen devastating tornadoes in the area. Throughout my interview and training process they demonstrated the compassion and amount of respect that they have for employees which made me so much more eager to be apart of the team.
good,"I love both the customers and coworkers.  Truly feels like we are all in this together.  Some policies feel cold and corporate.  As a kitchen designer it is VERY difficult at times,  doing the very best for the project and customer,  while maintaining walk in issues.  You really need some time alone at times to get certain things done. "
good,"Es una buena empresa ,solo los clientes sin muy difíciles ,de resto la empresa muy buena"

La très bonne sélection des employés fait en sorte que travailler chez Home Dépôt, c'est comme avoir une deuxième famille avec beaucoup d'amis de qualité. Seul point négatif: le salaire de chaque employé est négocié à la pièce et on constate qu'il y a de bons écarts de salaire pour des emplois équivalents."
good,"Busy and enjoyable place to work. Room for advancement. Excellent Human Resources Department. Very accommodating. The Home Depot also promoted a team environment where nobody feels excluded. I learned a great deal about hardware and different hardware applications. I also learned a great deal about power tools and their different applications. I would definitely recommend the Home Depot for a place to work. They offer all the amenities to promote a family environment. Their moto is ""work hard: play hard"". The Home Depot is also very community oriented. They go out of their way to reach out and help those in distress after natural disasters in offering to rebuild homes. They also reach out to the elderly and help revamp homes when the homeowner is not able to do it themselves. They also reach out to our veterans and offer discounts for those who are actively serving or who have served. They also take care of their own employees in that if an employee becomes sick and unable to work and pay their bills they will take money from coffers that fellow employees have contributed to and give it to the employee in need."
good,"I like the culture of the home depot, whatever face to the customer, or face to the associate. They gave me enough time to learn more and grow up more. We treat customer very good, so customer treat us very good as well. I like to work here if not thinking about the salary:)"

good,Really good company and associates you actually feel like your word it means something to someone else and when u help customer the smile on their face it means everything
good,Home Depot was actually my very first job and it really is a great place to start! Depending on the positions they are offering you will get hired within a week or so. Pay is decent and you get pay raises depending on the type of review you get every 6 months. There is room for promotion if you work hard and show them how much you learned.
good,Learned many things regarding building material and plants.Good place to work. part time employees get benefits. Diverse employees and they hire special needs. Nothing really hard about the job if you can put up with retail.
good,"•	Provide customer service"
good,The Home Depot was very good to me at one point. The wages sucks unless your a specialist or home decore or pro desk that’s what they cater too. But other than that it’s pretty chill
good,The Home Depot is a good company to work for. Depending the store management is a key role in whether you would like your job environment or not. Personally my job and management is good. Pay is OK could be better but above state minimum. Overall I really like the Home Depot.

good,"I started as part-time service associate and then moved to department supervisor position, always get support from my colleagues, positive environment, very specific culture that I like. Thanks"
good,"El trabajo es duro pero a la vez satisfactorio por qué tienes que atender a los clientes con sus proyectos, te mantiene ocupado todo el turno, en cuestión de crecimiento laboral es bajo ya que los supervisores de departamento no quieren crecer por qué no se les exige mucho, en lo que tiene que ver con lo económico la empresa paga mejor que en cualquier otro lugar de aquí en la ciudad."
good,Would recommend as a starting place especially for college students or someone entering the work force. College tuition reimbursement. Flexible hours. Potential to move up and management is usually promoted from within.
good,"I enjoy spending time with my team, coaching and developing them in new processes, selling skills and watching them succeed along with establishing strong relationships with clients."
good,Great place to work this job has taught me so much I learn something new everyday and all of my co workers are always ready and willing to lend a hand in getting this done in a professional efficient manner
good,"the job will literally be as haed as you make i, otherwise its easy enough. the hard part is dealing with stuff that cant be finished in a certain time frame"
good,"Home Depot is a great place for you to expand your future career path. Whether it's just as a sales associate, becoming a manager, person in the call center, or anything like that. You can take a path to get there. There are many opportunities to start to climb the ladder"

good,"The Home Depot can be a fun place to work as long as you concentrate on the training to understand the business. Times can be stressful but if you are willing to train and learn, then you will make it out okay."
good,"Home Depot is a place where, people come and go, they ask for something and you tell them where it's at. The conversation ends there and move onto the next customer."
good,Our division was shut down. That was the only downside I had with Home Depot.  Home Depot was a great company and I loved my job.  Home Depot gave all the employees that they let go a great severance package.
good,"If you're a retail professional and ever have the opportunity give The Home Depot a shot. They truly live servant leadership & immediatly engage you in a family oriented culture. Yes it has all the markings of Retail management, but with a passion for work life balance, building wealth for it's team members, and a fun environment"
good,"Fast paced, busy,  most associates great to get along with, good on the job training-but hard to find time to get further training done when working during busy season."
good,great place to work they offer more training to employees then anyone I can think of its always room to move up however the pay is no good and people leave for more money elsewhere.
good,"Flexible schedule, good fellow associates, good work environment, excellent benefits, able to adjust work times for family needs and strong ethics practiced by mgmt."
good,great place to work if you can handle heavy things and is not afraid of heights the train you on every machine they expect you to know everything about the store but not move from your location
good,"Meet with multiple vendors to discuss Product placement, signage, new product design & development. Responsible for taking such information and training store employees on features and benefits. The workplace culture is one of camaraderie and teamwork. The hardest part of the job was communication with senior management."
good,"Great benefits. Exceptional computer training. On the job training depends on who is training you. When short staffed they might have you cover another department even if your new to your own department which can be nerve wracking. Best advise is to absorb everything you can and get on the computer for some Homer training every chance you get. The most difficult part of the job would have to be that you will eventually run in to some of those customers that will have a bad day and treat you like garbage. Just don't take it personally and remember someone else has to go home to that, but its not you :)"
good,"Pretty relaxed part time job. I usually worked out in the garden department which was often pretty slow and easy, but sometimes required help for loading mulch or other products."
good,Training is comprehensive and includes cross training in sister departments. I expanded my knowledge base considerably and carry that knowledge with me to this day.
good,"Training program is comprehensive. Also, cross training for neighbor departments was a priority. I came to work with experience and knowledge but left with so much more."
good,"It was a great environment, people would do their job so others wouldn't have to. Management is great and would listen to peoples needs. All workers gave their all."
good,Everboday very down to earth and very helpful very good hours sometimes they pay for food for the employees always was a way to make extra money they had a very good open door rule the best place i ever work to be truthful with you
good,Amazing place to work at however you will be your own manager in the store driving results through reports led Intel as well as daily routines that help identify theft. There inst room for advancement however which is undoubtedly sad considering how amazing this company is to work for.
good,I worked at Home Depot for five years. I lived working there. We were a team. We had monthly meetings. If you hit hard times they have an employee care fund. I wish I never left.
good,Great company with great room for advancement. Sky is the limit in what you can do with the company. They take care of their employees very well. For example during Hurricane Harvey they personally called to check on every employee to make sure they were safe and if they needed help.
good,"The tasks provided was a great learning curve over the amount of time I worked there with the ability to learn and grasp new skills. Great training, awesome work environment, and reasonable schedule."
good,"Working home depot lumber recovery has been challenging. We are majorly understaffed in my department so we have to work extra hard to keep the department stocked. I don't mind the challenge because I can never be bored at work. I'm constantly moving and lifting heavy objects. I enjoy the environment, the co worker, and managers are respectful. The management is always feeding us and making sure we are satisfied with the company."
good,A good place to work with plenty of opportunities to advance. Good culture and interest in taking care of both our customers and our employees. Great benefits and stock options. Bi annual profit sharing. However you have to rely on some employees who just don't care about doing their job well which creates problems for others in the store.
good,"very good fellow staff and management, comfortable workspace and welcoming environment. Very good discipline, taught me the basic of society and how every day transactions work, also taught me customer care and support first hand"
good,It was good while it lasted i got in trouble for nealing one day and about two weeks after i quit because i had been diagnosed with addison's disease whitch causes you to be very tired all the time but i do remember everyone being very helpful and nice there im still friends with some coworkers from there
good,"Buena valoración al empleado, se trabaja por objetivos y eso es lo que lo hace dinámico a este trabajo."
good,"My role is comprehensive where it encompasses staffing coaching and training associates ensuring their success in their role."
good,Can rely on management to address any of your concerns or questions.  Management is always available to assist in customer issues to make sure the customer is always satisfied.
good,It’s a great company to work for. The only issue I had is that they don’t do anything to fix the problems of workplace harassment. Management just brushes it off and corporate just blows it under the rug
good,I love the job management is ok benefits is great amd the people that you work with are really friendly i honestly say this is the best job i ever had.
good,"Hard working group of employees that are given several perks and tools to climb their ladder of success.  Great management team, very supportive and driven."
good,"I personally  learned  alot of leadership  roles at the Home depot, safety standards especially how critical it could be in the environment, for accidents."
good,great job and i have worked with a great staff at home depot. The workplace feels like a home environment and my co workers are like family. I learned how to deal with customers and help them with their needs when faced with a dilemma. This job really introduced me to the customer service experience and was a perfect platform for me to learn from.
good,Best part of working at THD service desk was the interaction with the customers. Good and bad. The worse part was the inability to go as far as needed to help the customer. The management at Home Depot was very good. Enjoyed my time there.
good,"As with all jobs, enjoyment is dependent upon the store and management, but all Home Depot stores have the ability for anyone to advance depending upon what they want to learn. There are mandatory classes per rule and safety classes every month, but also additional training (on the clock) that you can take to become more valuable to the company and your team. They keep some of their seasonal hires depending on how well they mesh and work with their department. "
good,"The Home Depot is an excellent company to work for.    "
good,I really enjoyed working at Home Depot. I was happy working with customers and employees. The management was also great and worked with me when I first started on scheduling because I was on work release.
good,"I loved working at The Home Depot.  I never worked for a company where your peers actually were more like family than your real family.  I appreciate the experience The Home Depot provided me, and if I started when I was younger, it would have been my preference to fast-track all the way to corporate management."
good,I worked nights and when i started i really enjoyed it but being 18 and working nights was tough... No social life outside of work and brief chats with friends. they offered me to work days but i was focused on getting fit and to go to the gym and work with heavy lifting would not have worked at the time GREAT PLACE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND
good,"Can learn alot and advance thru company not a dead end type of employment.Great for detail oriented people also gives medical ,dental and vision benefits"
good,One of the best companies i ever worked for. They actually trained you for your role in the company so that you could be successful. Had an all around good ex prince.
good,Great place to work no complaints. Enjoyed the environment I was in.Did have to stand for hours at a time but the pay was worth it.Coworkers were fun to work with too
good,Home Depot has a lot of benefits for its employees awesome company to work for a lot of growth with the company as well . I would always work back there if I have the opportunity
good,I love working at home Depot but there is a wall that you can't escape. To go into a supervisor position you need to be available 24/7 365 days a year. Not worth the 25 cent pay raise from what I'm doing right now
good,Our store was tremendously busy. Typical day was punch-in and right to work as many contractors were waiting. Most days were none stop. We did(mandatory) take our breaks and lunch. Co-workers in every department in our store were amazing - always helpful. We had mandatory monthly training as well as training as needed. You couldn't ask for better management in our store. They were great in every aspect. Monthly management would put out a spread of food for the entire store. One thing you do learn is how to be part of a team.

good,This is a job where you can start from and do not recommend staying unless you have amazing people skills to bring the customers back again. I had to deal with bad customers and was not fun.
good,"In my experience with The Home Depot, is that your fellow associates push you to succeed. Because when you succeed, so do other associates. If your store exceeds plan, employees are given a bonus, depending on your time as an associate. Management Staff are very friendly, and engaging with associates. Working here can be fast paced, and can seem to pull you in different directions. But, it is also rewarding, when a customer is successful in their project, and return to show gratitude for taking time to just listen."

good,"I worked at home depot as a receiving associate while in college. The management was helpful and was always asking how they could make our lives better while working there. It was a physically demanding job, but there were opportunities to change to different departments if desired."
good,"When I originally started the store manager was pretty decent our department head was good at her job also, but one of the sub managers was a micromanger that would call us on the walkie talkie and tell us he saw us on the camera slacking when we were resting after we helped another department because it was slow. But he was replaced with better assistant managers who weren't condescending which makes you actually like going to work. Overall a decent manager and fun employees really make a diffrence."
good,"Exiting and productive fun place to work, I like the fact that I can share information with customers and meet new people every day. I also like training, it is important to learn more about the products."

good,"Nice place to work. Associates are nice. You can ask any associate for help and they will basically drop what the are doing and help both physically and/or verbally. I enjoyed working for the management, although you will find that some management are not worth their weight in s___, like anyplace else."

good,Financially strong company with strong cash base. Good work culture with no politics at all. Regular training for your skill improvement. But has very low salary.

good,"Manager was great.. hardest thing I had to do is.... Walking out... The other employees were AMAZING as well.. if I'm not mistaking, I think I went thru indeed for home Depot to"
good,A great company to work for. Stable. Home Depot is a Dow Industrial company. They do a great job of motivating and helping us by providing all of the tools for success. And the there's the additional benefit of discounted stock purchases.
good,Enjoyable but very fast paced. Had generally achievable daily goals. Safety oriented. Adjustable shifts. Provided almost all necessary tools. Was physically demanding.

good,"Log into the phone system by your designated start time. "
good,Home Depot is great I am the only source of income at my home. So I need an extra income. And I keep working hard to get promoted. At The Home Depot it is very hard to get managment positions.
good,"I enjoyed working with Home Depot, however the overnights are a little rough on the body it’s time for me to find a day job with somewhat normal hours"
good,I enjoyed working the freight team overnight. No employee discounts. I cant recall anything about benefits (this was quite some time ago). I would love to get that job back.
good,"Great Company to work for. Entrepreneurial leadership opportunities. Work life balance is a challenge, however, its a wonderful company to work for. The work place culture is great. Management are insightful."
good,"My typical day at Home depot was coming in about a half and hour early eat my breakfast or lunch then punch in. As soon as your hit the sales floor it was time to take care of customers. If you like helping people and like to interact with customers then this it the job you want. Management was very cool and let you do your own thing and also was ready to help you out in any way. My only con is the hours, sometimes your dayshift and the next week your nightshift. Fellow employees were also there to help out whenever they could. I heard from several coworkers that not all home depots are the same this store in Butler is one the better ones to work for."
good,"Would encourage young people to join this company "
good,I would recommend any one to work there. They just need to be more involved with there employees make them feel appreciated. Very well clean company management wasn't perfect but try thier best to make everyone successful

Friendly work environment it’s your home away from home everyone is silly to teach and help... excellent benefits... career advancement can relocated to any city where’s there’s a Home Depot. Great a part time job even better as a full time... they are willing to work with you... tuition reimbursement"
good,Es un lugar con buen ambiente para trabajar la mayoría de las personas se apoyan entre ellos para lograr las metas...
good,"Checking customers out at the self checkout and assisting customers find item."
good,Good work place over all benefits are really good the time management and flexibility could be a little better. Some managers take business really serious instead of looking after their associates but an overall good place to work.
good,This is a very family oriented company although the pay was low I was very happy working for Home Depot. Manegment was fair and everyone worked as a team. I made a million dollars for the company and only received a .35 cent raise which was pretty sad but beside that I enjoyed working there.
good,The hardest part of the job was not getting some customers to sign up with their credit cards to get reward points. It wasn't a job that was stressful.
good,"I love staying busy and helping customers .Everyone needs hardware , nuts, bolts , etc.The hardest part of my job was when we were short handed and I had to run 2-3 departments on my shift with no help. The best part was customers were very understanding as long as you tried to help and communicated with them. (acknowledge them)."
good,If you are looking for a company that takes care of their associates The Home Depot is definitely one of them. Considering the fast paced environment it is fairly laid back.
good,I found Home Depot to be a good place to work overall. Room for advancement if you are self motivated and demonstrate ability. Management is always as helpful as they could be.
good,"The Home Depot truly follows Servant Leadership guidelines and works very hard at taking care of not only the customers, but the employees. I have never had such a wonderful experience in a corporate/ retail setting before. I only left to completely focus on my education or I would still be there."
good,"A typical day at work meant that I saw everyone that I became super close with and was ensured during every morning meeting that we were a team and safety was our goal. I learned a lot of things from safety for stretching before using equipment or lifting heavy things to how to be an exceptional customer service associate and cashier. The management was exceptional they did everything they could to make sure that the work place was a safe environment. The hardest part of my job was probably dealing with unruly customers but you will deal with that every where. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have a bit of responsibility and feeling as if they trusted me enough to handle the money and transactions on my own without being stared down. Once I understood all the material on what to do the only time I received help was when I asked for it,  which personally I love."
good,"Muy buena capacitaciòn al personal"
good,The environment is friendly and calm. The Managers did not hassle me every thirty minutes about what am I doing or how I should talk to the customers.
good,a typical day is greeting everyone a little chit chat taking care of customers and sticking by your station. i learned how to do more than one position to be able to expand my hours.
good,"I had numerous responsibilities as dishwasher yet management realized my potential & promoted me several times. I learned different positions; assisted grill cook, salad maker, stocker/inventory clerk & food prep. My manager was very pleased about my work ethic and willingness to learn duties in various departments. The staff was super professional and hard working; also courteous to the max. Sometimes working with temps could be challenging because they had to be monitored constantly. All in all, just seeing what we accomplished was very rewarding. It was hard work but the end justified the means."
good,My days working were enjoyable as it could be for work. Almost everyone got along and it was a very laid back atmosphere. The company did a lot for their workers including employee appreciation and recognizing persons who did exceptional work the previous weeks leading up to meeting. Teamwork was a good aspect of the company as well.
good,Great people great working space everyone helps everyone love  how crew members live help each other you make a career as well here if family members sick help these things as well why love this company
good,"J'ai appris beaucoup au cours de mes années de travail chez Home Déport, et ce, surtout à la Location d'outils."
good,Fast paced job with a lot of employment opportunities. If you are willing to learn then they are willing to teach you. very worried about fitting i but it took me no time at all.
good,I love working with this company. They embrace a family-like atmosphere that makes it enjoyable to work here. They seem to genuinely care about employer safety and happiness.
good,Home depot is the best place to work with all the opportunities for a growing career. It brings you all the tools and on going training to be a successful person.
good,I loved working for Home Depot. I felt the company took care of their employees. Sometimes at the store level managers were a hit and miss with Home Depot values.
good,"Una gran empresa para trabajar, hay un gran ambiente laboral, las oportunidades son constantes"
good,I have met many different people and made a few friends at work. Spending 11 wonderful years and counting . The benefits are great and I have developed better professional skills there.
good,"Great work culture with a lot of opportunity to grow. A lot of hands on, physical work. Great learning experience for home improvement. Management always helpful and supportive."
good,"Job Duties:"

good,Like with any job you get out of it what you you put into it.The people and the management are just wonderful.  Really a people first company. Loved working there.
good,My experience at Home depot was great. Quarterly raises and safety bonuses and a comaraderie that goes unsurpassed. The environment was fun and everyone was so helpful and honest.
good,Typical day at work communicating with customers and making sure there experience is a good one. I learned how to handle who was stealing or trying to.
good,I worked as a Millwork Specialist and pretty much enjoyed my job other than having to repeatedly call and harass customers for weeks trying to sell projects. But the company is great and benefits are good.
good,"Home depot is a great place to work retail. Higher wages,store bonuses through out the year,dental and vision for part timers. I got around 30-35 hours with open availability. My co workers made every day great and has a family vibe when you walk into work. Would definitely go back!"
good,I enjoyed my time at Home Depot. I liked all the people I worked with in all departments. Everyone was there to help the customer and each other. The hours were good.
good,I personally loved eorking at Home Depot I felt respected and treated more like a friend than a worker who wants money for attendance it was a fun job where the dry moments are still learning experiences.
good,"Home Depot is a great place to work. You can go to work, have a list of tasks to complete along with assisting customers, and then go home. You never have to take work home with you. Most store managers and assistant managers are very supportive. Many of them will help with department tasks, and all of them assist with customer care. It is definitely a team environment and I highly recommend this employer."
good,Great benefits and fun work environment.  Great managers to work with. I had the pleasure to work here for 3 years and everyone was always nice. If you’re looking  for a great full time or part time job I say start at Home Depot.
good,"enjoyed working with team ,good work ethics ,very friendly people,great benefits, xmas party,store manager very approachable.loved working with custumors."
good,Good job wish it played more. Good benefits. Have to travel to different locations but you get travel pay. Four ten hour days.                       .
good,"One of the best jobs I’ve ever had because of the benefits. Also great pay, helpful management & training. However there’re not flexible with work hours so you have to comply or they’ll fire you. Job takes up a lot of hours."
good,"I started off sticking parts and they really worked with my school schedule to help me make money and have enough time to study. Once I was there for a few months they offered me a chance to become a sales associate. Then a raise right after, it was a very good experience wish I had stayed."
good,"A typical day at THD would include the motivation of leadership to hit daily goals. This was encouraged from the General Manager on down. we would incorporate luncheons with small goals that lead to prizes and large success share checks for larger goals. This was all done under the pristine leadership of our General Manager. He empowered each leader and Associate. He knew us by name and knew about each of us. He drove our DC from being number 13 on leader boards to number 1. He created an environment of pride among all of the people in the building. He reminded us that if you did not make your daily goal be able to ""speak to your business"". if you can communicate root causes that legitimately prevented goals being met and you had a solution to the problem, we would say OKay and then either of us should expect this reason to prevent the goal going forward.In other words we would fix the root cause or remove the obstacle."
good,"Great co-workers, everyone knows their role, management is always available for talks or problems. Good structure. Pay could be better but benefits for part time workers helped to ease the pay pain. Had to quit to relocate but would definitely work for them again. "
good,"the time worked at home depot was a very good learning time,if i get the chance i would do it again.i was on the m.e.t traveling team and i enjoy t a lot"
good,"Everyone needs to get treated equally. Management needs to put their foot down a little more. It wouldn’t hurt to give more hours. Overall, the company is a great company to work for."
good,"The Home Depot is the most associate friendly company I have ever worked for.  They take care of their employees, so in turn, their employees tend to be long term and loyal.  The work can be hard, there is a lot of heavy merchandise in that store, but 9 times out of 10 there is other associates around to help.  In fact, that was one of the things that most impressed about the company -- they keep a full staff on the schedule at all times.  One of my biggest complaints about retail in general has always been that they never have enough employees in the store to both wait on customers and get other essential things (like stocking merchandise on the shelves) done as well.  With The Home Depot, that is almost never the case.  They often seem to have more employees then they need . . . but that is so much more preferable than the skeleton crew scenario.  There is always something to do in retail, even if it's just sweeping the floor -- so in my opinion there are never too many employees.  I would and have recommended to more than I count friends and acquaintances that if they work retail, The Home Depot is the company to work for."
good,"Love this place absolutely love  Home Depot,  Home depot has help some and my family. I’m forever grateful. I really enjoy going to work.ill recommend HD to anyone"
good,"Home Depot provides many opportunities for you to recurves benefits and discounts. They try their hardest to keep their associates safe, providing many safety tips."
good,"I was a customer service supervisor at home depot. I answered all manager request from customer and covered the front end. Also I would change all prices, logos and banners throughout the store."
good,"Great place to work. Customers can be a bit much to handle at times especially when they don’t know what they want, but overall it’s worth it. Most of the employees feel more like family than they do coworkers, and that culture is embraced. We are encouraged to work as a team, not “it’s not my department, not my problem”. Management expects a lot, but it’s worth it to strive towards that high expectation."
good,Very good company to work for.  Many different departments to choose from. Training is provided with periodic updates. Community involvement  is quite evident.
good,"The people at this Home Depot are wonderful to work with. The management has improved with the addition of the new GM. Everyone helps each other and are very supportive. If I could get a F/T position, I would retire from here."
good,"New experiences, group working and team cooperation "
good,"Overall a very good place to work,management and culture of the store are excellent,they work with you to achieve your goals,only drawback is the pay and hours are not very competetive"
good,Overall the best job I had they work well with your hours everyone in other departments were very friendly and willing to help you out if you needed anything.
good,Intracting with all types customers helps you learn about different cultures. Never a dull moment. It's a very good learning environment. Very good place to work with great benifits.
good,This company considers both customer and the well being of their employees. Provides a variety and the highest quality materials and products to choose from.Its also a productive and fun place to work for both management and employee.
good,I learned how to manage and train other associated in a stressful fast paced environment. teamwork and hard work always encouraged. Decent pay and good benefits.
good,"Every day varies, depending on associates management and customers. One good thing about Home Depot is they will train you on site for your department. Most of the time you will have good co workers to help when your out on the floor with those little questions. The hardest part of the job is if you are understaffed and are having to take care of multilple departments. And one of the best things about Home Depot is the friends you make, after a while they become your family."
good,I loved every aspect of what I did working for the Home Depot.  I only gave notice because I started my own business.  A contributing factor was the hours.  Home Depot does not have set shifts and as a manager you are required to work a wide range of hours.  It was also difficult to get a weekend off.  Also to move up in the company to an assistant store manager you are required to work even more hours and you are put on salary
good,"we are told to sell the customer what they need, not what they want.  that means if a customer is wanting a new toilet because the old one is not working right, we will sell them a repair kit and explain how to fix the problem for a fraction of the cost of a new toilet, which builds customer loyalty."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Home Depot, It was a family oriented environment, We worked in groups maintaining the product on the shelves, putting up displays and customer service, it's a great place with opprotunity to advance within."
good,"I loved my job at Home Depot. I worked there for 6 years, the culture is amazing. Associates are treated very well working for this company. It is retail though, so you will work weekends."
good,enjoyed working here however my love is in robotics and automation which I would like to return to working with I would recommend working here to anyone who would enjoy working with people
good,"I enjoyed working for Home Depot. The store I worked for was managed very well. Supportive environment, team building, usually fun. As in most work places, employees are expected to do their jobs. Heavy accentuation is placed on safety. If one is motivated, there is a wealth of potential for education (search the computers and ask, folks), and potential for working up within the company is there. Home Depot acknowledges hard work.  I have 2 Coastal Redwoods growing in my yard right now that were gifts of acknowledgement for my achievements along with multiple awards. The hardest part of the job for me was that I felt I was working below my potential.  Home Depot employs many retired individuals who supported their families working socially respectable careers. It is ignorance of the public to assume these people lack value and all they are capable of is locating items on shelves and not knowing where things are.  I hear the anti-box store commercials, too. The truth is Home Depot does employ those with basic levels of education and works in conjunction with community programs for mentally challenged individuals but Home Depot also employs retired carpenters, electricians, plumbers, teachers, nurses, previous CEOs, upper management, etc.  Our store had holiday parties, success sharing events, volunteer community work, education for the public. What moved me the most was how the store came together to help each other in need.  Donations, bake sales, Home Depot itself matched employee financial donations for fellow employees going through difficult times. I know of funerals for"
good,The Home Depot has good managers.  The job can be stressful at times if one doesn't know anything about home improvement.  The workers all get along with each other.
good,"I had a great experience, but I know I owe a lot of that to amazing people I worked with. I only worked at one location, but I imagine there is a similar feel at other stores."
good,I found working at The Home Depot was all about work life balance. I enjoyed most tasks I was given and I enjoyed the freedom I was given to improve processes and procedures.
good,I t is a very fun culture and they appreciate you as an employee (depending on the manager). you arrive 15 minutes earlier than you schedule.The garden Center is the best spot.It has way less loss prevention and walkouts.the also have a homer rewards program and fund for employees in  need such as day care rent utilities.
good,I loved working for Home Depot. Whenever I needed help i got the assistance. I learned how to be patient with customers. Work was always easy for me and the day would go by. I enjoyed talking to most of the customers
good,Varitey in work environment. Lots of support from management. Various shifts available. Provide excellent opportunity for movement three departments. Clean safe place to work.
good,"The 11 years I worked there, as a part-time employee were very rewarding. I learned a lot about customer service and product knowledge. Working with various co-workers were a bonus as well."
good,Exelente servicio y ayuda al cliente siempre con el mejor servicio para apoyar y ayudar a los demás
good,"Management was exceptional, a lot of hard working members achieving the same goal for the stores success and for your success. Other coworkers helped phenomenally to improve yourself in the stores work environment."
good,I loved my job it was a bit stressful and customer can be very aggressive but we were a family a team  the pay was good and if u worked hard it would most definitely pay off the benefits seemed awesome I never got the chance to use them sadly to say
good,I really enjoyed working at the Home Depot. The workplace environment was fun and always energetic. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers. I got to know some of thing on a personal level.
good,"more to learn with working in Home depot not only in knowledge of fast pace movement in general, working atmosphere and easy to adapt the culture and values for safety as worker in he place."
good,Home Depot is a great company they always give back to the employees they are always trying to impove the work environment. They will give to you but they will not tolerate lazy working or slacking off but if u work hard for them they will reciprocate it back to you.
good,"i learn no matter where you work at you have to be 100% on your job at all times? it was a very good place to work in but i felt like it could of been in a nice area . hardest part of my job was me trying to help my co-workers and other people i felt like i was doing things that wasnt part of my job but i do really appreciate do the experience."
good,"It might just be my store, but I've never had a work place environment where I actually know that the people around me care if something happens to me."
good,"Great place to work overall. However, no communication between the Assistant Managers. They tell you one thing and then another AM comes and tells you something different. They micromanage down to the Associates."
good,"from the time that i have worked there everyone is willing to help the new kid on the block which is great, everyone is very friendly and ready to work the minute they clock in"
good,Home depot is a great place to work love going to work . Great benefits.  401 k and able to have stock. I been with home depot going on 17 years.  A great  retirement  plan
good,"Call on vendors, customers, and contractors to confirm order details"
good,It was great working at Home Depot. But Management sucks! The success bonuses every 6 months was great! It just sucks that management had there own little groups!
good,"I loved my job at the home depot and I do believe I bleed orange and would stay with the company until I retired if there was one where I live currently. The atmosphere is fun and excited, people are great, everyone is always willing to help, the opportunities are endless, and most of the time, management is willing to help promote and grow the associates in the company."
good,"Everyone that I work with is great making it very easy to go to work. I have enjoyed working at the Home Depot for four years."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was fun and exciting. It was not a dreadful place to go to everyday. It was fast pace a lot of the time, but when you had down time, it was nice to get to know the other employees. It didn't feel like the other employee's were co-workers either; they were more like family."
good,They even give you bi annually bonuses if all sales were met for the half. Biweekly pay. Good management. Easy training. Have to keep on your trainings and product knowledge.
good,"I loved working at the service desk, and I miss it as well I love working with some of the associates and some of the managers but, I have to say unfortunately this was the messiest place I’ve ever worked at."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot . A very simple non-complex job that pays well to start. Co-workers are friendly . Positive work environment . I was there for a year and there was plenty of opportunity to change departments and grow with the company .
good,Employees are treated really well. Great training. Employees are educated and empowered. Compensation can seem low at times but there is a lot of room for advancement and sticking around can be worth it.
good,"A typical day at work at Home Depot was usually fun as long as you were working you could have fun as well. I learned alot from Home Depot, I learned management skills and how to do proper inventory.Management was always very supportive and took care of any issues instantly.The hardest part of the job was learning the heavy equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I made and the moral was always happy."
good,The skills learned from working at the Home Depot help to improve one's ability around the house. It also helps build teamwork and management skills while working.
good,I love working for the home depot. The people are wonderful and its always busy. Lots of room for advancement but they could definitely pay their employees a lot better for what they do.
good,I .have worked all the jobs at home depot. the best department for an hourly associate would be appliances. it earns the most hours so your never too swamped. Mind you running a dept is an entirely different thing. It is was you put in to it.
good,"It was an easy going job as long as you did what you needed to do. Staff was similar to one big family, everyone was very friendly and inviting to new employees. Management made it clear what roles and responsibilities you were to have."
good,"Each work day had tasks that were completed individually or as a team."
good,"The Home Depot is a Great Company to work for, there are a lot of job opportunities and growth. The company participates in profit sharing twice a year."
good,The Home Depot is an amazing place to work. They truly care about their employees and are very family oriented. I really enjoyed my time there and would go back to working for them in a heartbeat. I would recommend this company to anyone. Amazing management. Amazing coworkers and customers.
good,Working in the garden department I learned many new skills and information that allowed me to better serve customers. Management was always on hand and I was on the safety committee where we as a team made sure that all safety regulations were followed and work areas were accident free.
good,A typical day varies depending on if there is a truck to be unloaded or not. Usually if we have a truck we are busy from start to finish. I learned a lot from how to unload a truck safely to leaving work in one piece.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Home Depot. The managers were very caring, helpful and didn't mind being hands on. My co-workers were great and I still have many good friendships from my time working here. Company parties and quarterly meetings were fun and exciting. Amazing company overall."
good,"Home Depot has a program called Homer Fund. Everyone has the option to contribute to this program out of his or her paycheck."
good,"The best thing about for The Home Depot was the staff. From the Store Manage down to the sale associates, we all kept a safe, respectful and welcoming work environment."
good,Great place to work has taught me many things. Benefits total compensation are very good. The core values and servant leadership are part of the idea the founders had and still live true in the stores today.
good,"Very comfortable job, sometimes physically demanding but overall very fun and relax job. it can get competitive and a little stressful because you have to get certain productivity numbers a day, but not to hard to get."
good,Home Depot is a retail job. Some days the store will be empty and you'll be trying to look busy and other days you'll be up to your neck with things you have to do. Either way it's fun but the customer is always right and some contractors may be short tempered. The management at my store was pretty good. Sometimes I didn't agree with what they wanted from the department but you aren't supposed to like them all the time. My coworkers and department supervisor were cool. The most enjoyable thing is getting your forklift license. On slow days you can downstock tons.
good,very fun job people were all kind and down to earth aswell as management the salary was ok for the time being but there was a lot of room for growth just unforeseen circumstances arose
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. 401K, Sick available when hired, vacation accrues until after the first year. Stock options, and outside discounts (No discounts for Home Depot purchases). I went in with a goal for advancement, and was given that opportunity, but went to a department with supervisor who had no management skills, and was let go because of it.."
good,"Like anywhere, you will have negative people to deal with from time to time.  On a whole though, I would say that Home Depot is an excellent company to work for."
good,I love working here with all my peers and managers. The only bad thing is that you’re more than likely only get parttime due to it being a college town. I currently get paid $11 per hour and I find it fair. They have awesome programs and are there for the employees. Cira the store manager is bomb! All the managers are amazing and honestly so easy to talk to. I’ve loved working here and plan to stay a lot time.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Home Depot. I loved the culture. It proved that if you worked hard, that you will be rewarded. My only regret was that I was unable to continue my career there due to personal reasons."
good,"Too few hours for me. It's a great place to work if you are retired. Some games with fellow associates, had to belong to their group. Management great, Great Core working ethics, trust, empowerment."
good,"I loved working for The Home Depot,  the fun fast paced place where you learn about things you never knew. They challenge you to give the best customer experience daily which keeps you on your toes."
good,"A typical day is a fun but it’s about building relationships and assisting customers. I have learned a lot because I work with a diverse group of people who’s opinion and views I respect daily.  Management geniuely cares about the issues good or bad, the times I have encountered . The hardest part of the job is telling someone no or not being able to help after you have done all you can.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making someone’s day by excellent customer service internally or externally."
good,I enjoyed my experience at the Expo Design Center I loved going to work the management as well as the co workers whom i have still remained friends with were awesome I could not have asked for a better team nor working enviroment
good,"the people are awesome to work with, it was busy at times, I wasn't there long enough to really rate, management is nice, learned quit a bit, on your feet for 12 hours bout its good cause its only 3 days a week you get healthcare offered after your 90 days"
good,"People treat each other with respect."
good,"* Typical day at work includes customer service, stocking product. "
good,"The only downside I found at the store I was employed at was the blatant drama and politics that went into some of the layers of management and associate departments. But regardless of this the managers, one on one, were welcoming and approachable, the departments felt cohesive, and there was a general feeling of warmth comparative to that of a family."
good,"People are kind and supportive. I didn’t have health insurance because I missed the deadline. All in all, I wish I was still there. I enjoyed helping customers."
good,"Working For The Home Depot was a great experience for me, and I would recommend working for this company if you like customer service and construction."
good,"Home Depot offered part time benefits, great training, and gave back to both the employees and the community through volunteer work and the Homer Fund. I would highly recommend working for them. The only true downside besides the hours of working (normal retail environment) is that it is difficult to get into the higher positions at Home Depot. They higher within normally and its a very large pool of candidates that have been with the company for a long time applying."
good,awesome job especially for students lots of room to advance great benefits. Great place for people looking for good hours and a strong company to believe in
good,"I have worked at both stores in Wichita KS, I was treated so well that it was hard to leave, Hours were predictable and stayed pretty much the same. Management would never ask you to do something that they were not willing to do themselves."
good,"If you like handy DIY projects, loud noises or meeting new people, this is the place to be. There are plenty of opportunities to expand your knowledge on home improvement (something we all have or like to do)."
good,"The company is very employee oriented and they help each other out as best as possible"
good,I enjoyed it and would have continued to work there if it wasnt for my immediate supervisor. Home Depot has a great work ethic and is very much a family spirit
good,A GOOD place to work. My immediate manager was awesome. My Co-workers were awesome. The pay was OK. I loved working at the Garden department. My main job was watering the garden plants and it's good to see your plants are well watered and green and Customers bought the flowers and plants daily.
good,"It's fun work if you take into consideration that it is still a retail position, in a very popular retail store. There are going to be times were you are going to want to quit and leave it all behind, but Home Depot is a very layed back store compared to most, and i highly recommend applying."
good,People there are friendly and helpful. You will learn product knowledge about almost everything in the store. It's a good starting place for people to learn.
good,"A great place to work, the managers are nice a friendly down to earth. Everybody is like a big family that enjoys each other and care about each other outside the work place."
good,aprehendí mucho que el cliente es primero los  directores siempre atentos.
good,"A typical day at home depot was overnight stocking merchandise on to shelves to remain in stock, organizing the sales floor to create a pleasant and safe shopping environment, and providing customer service as required by customer demand. I was very grateful that i was given the opportunity to work in a place like this. management was very open to what would make us comfortable in the work environment. While stocking shelves you were allowed to listen to music on your personal speaker and you sometimes were even able to work with who you would like if you were not distracted by the other workers. The hardest part of this job is balancing your self on the ladder while lifting boxes over a net. That was always a challenge for me personally. The people were friendly and Kind and very helpful."
good,"As a Merchandising Execution Associate (MEA) or Merchandising Execution Team (MET) Supervisor, you will have the ability to work full-time day or night shifts (non-traditional retail hours) and contribute to three key objectives: maintain store appearance, keep our products customer ready and/or transform the store for a new season. All to drive sales and keep customers coming back to shop at The Home Depot."
good,"You are a valued associate that’s treated very well.  Able to work a consistent shift as a full time hourly associate.  As a salaried manager, compensation package is excellent."
good,"fast paced work environment , very busy days and nights, late shifts, not every supervisor is professional or great to get along with, training is longer then average."
good,"The staff and management are fun, kind and want everyone to have a great experience when coming into home depot.  The strive for there staff to be the people that make a difference in someone's life or day simply by helping the customer in anyway possible."
good,Great Job! Always worked with my schedule but needed more hours or full time but no available spots. It’s a great company. Very welcoming and always respectful towards each other.
good,"Great place to work just poor pay.  Team members are and can be like family, and that makes it a fun place to work. Is busy during the season, but in winter it can be slow.  Leadership is great and if you work hard promotions are there including the training."
good,"Great place to work if you have the right supervisors and managers. They are not strict, and managers do no micromanage you. Job is easy, does require a lot of walking in a big store."
good,Overall a great place to work. Offered consistent but flexible work hours as well as great benefits. Part time pay is decent but it's hard to get a raise without a title switch or going full time.
good,"Conseiller en vente spécialisé"
good,"I'd recommend this company to anyone that is new to the workforce.  The Home Depot isn't incredibly picky about applicants as long as your schedule is flexible.  Weekends at my store were a requirement for my job. as they're the busiest days of the week there.  I worked in a very high-volume store, since it's on the border between New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  The ability for Massachusetts residents to simply drive a little farther away in order to avoid sales tax, meant that this job was chaotic at times.  Working at The Home Depot, I feel like I am part of a family.  Most of the time, the work I do feels appreciated.  One of the managers listened to me for 45 minutes when I was feeling down and genuinely believed that I could do amazing things.  When I told my coworkers that I had to transfer to a store in Florida to be with my husband, they threw me a little party and filled a massive tote bag with snacks for the drive.  It was difficult at times for sure, but overall I am happy with this company.  I hope that my new store will give off a similar vibe."
good,"Good workplace, they adapt your hours easily when you need it. Staff is nice, lunchs and activity once in a while, it’s nice! I recommend this olace for everyone!"
good,"Everyone is great here, and most customers are actually in a good mood, which is a pleasant surprise compared to most retail settings! Management is understanding when you're sick or have an emergency, most accommodating and understanding management I've ever had. Only complaint is the flip flop of typical part time hours, one day you're up at 5:30 AM to get to your shift at 7 AM, the next day you end at 10 PM, not the best for keeping on a schedule but overall great place to work!"
good,not qualify to make that assessment it was a good job it take time to work your way up to where you want to be  i had problem with my older parent at the time  .I Could get  where i need to go in the time i was there
good,"A great company to work for there is always room for improvement and opportunities to advance in whatever you decide on and the option to change is always there. Great staff like a second family, great mangers always willing to work with you and help whenever they can. Charitable company to those in need always. Hardest part of the job I would say is the coverage having enough people to do the work in the day, most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new interesting new people and seeing yourself grow and dealing with people and knowing that I can always grow in the company."
good,Management is awesome. Great co- workers and customers. Very hands on company. Management really cared for their employees. They offer room for advancement. Thought it was great they’re a nation wide company.
good,"Report for duty, then would wait until all mangers would call for a team meeting before every shift. Once the meeting was over we would report too our designated work area and then proceed to do our jobs the night. At the end of the shift we would clean up our work area and clock out."
good,"As a freight associate you will be required to operate at least 3 different kinds of lift trucks including: Order picker, Sit-Down Forklift, and Reach Truck.  You work independently and the only goal is to have the receiving room empty by the end of shift."
good,"I've really enjoyed my time and many positions at Home Depot! They live their core values! I've worked in many stores and the company message is very consistent across the board. Generally speaking, management is committed to meeting and exceeding expectations."
good,Some parts during the day was fun but busy. Had to learn a a lot of things about the store. Customers were sometimes bad to deal with but patience is key and they are important and you learn how deal with bad customers. Co-workers were great and everybody worked as a team.
good,"Great place to work, do your job and do it well you will get rewarded and promoted if you want it. Always be willing to help set up new stores for faster growth and promotions. Most people are friendly and want to help people, it is easy to see the employee who's only passing by and will not be a regular. Don't make friends with them. keep it moving."
good,"Working at the Home Depot was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot I didn't like home improvements, DIY's and it was  just a rewarding experience, also I met a lot of interesting people with different backgrounds. Overall my experience here was a fun and exciting."
good,It was great place to work loved being cashier n getting to meet customers. New n same customers. Easy work nothing hard had good benefits. I only got part time n drove 25 miles away from home n needed full time work close to home.
good,A typical day at work for me is being able to put smile on people faces. I've learned how to be a better leader within myself and teach others things I have learned.
good,"Awesome place to work because of the people. Management was a little ridiculous, but when push comes to shove, they would back you up. They care about their employees physical health and do everything they can to be sure you are okay."
good,"There are few places one can manage projects on such a large scale. The work was challenging, but they do a good job of recognizing associates. The people I worked with and for were all dedicated to making an impact on the business and giving back to the communities across the nation and beyond."
good,"My typical day is helping customers find items, customer service, ringing up merchandise, making change, and handling money.  The hardest part of job is recovering merchandise from potiential shoplifters.  "
good,"big focus on in stock, customer service and store appearance. Management was engaged and interested in who you were and where your career aspirations might lead you. Incredible culture and very rare from a bib company standpoint. If you get the privilege to work for this company you can have an incredible career."
good,This is a grat company to work for that really cares about its employees. The schedule works grat with my other obligations. Just wish I made more money. Great job for someone starting out in life that wishes to move up through the ranks.
good,Customer Service number 1 priority. Taking care of associates with a core of values also a priority. The care of customers makes for a fast day. Managing in a way to take care of associates is very rewarding.
good,"I was cahier"
good,Everyday when I went into work I'd clock in and put on my vest and get straight to business. I learned how to operate many different machines that involves moving very heavy objects. The management were friendly and very helping. They'd teach you everything you need to know and more! In the work place I worked overnight so it wasn't very crowded or many costumers that'll come through. The hardest part of the job would have to be sitting at a computer watching videos about things you were already taught. it was only hard because I had to sit in one spot for 8 hours and look at a screen. The most enjoyable part of the job would be stocking. I enjoyed it because we were allowed to work and listen to music at the same time and i love music.
good,"Great working with others, relaxed environment. The HR department is great to work with and everyone is treated with respect and open minded towards cooperating with others. Opportunities for advancement and long term career."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Home Depot. I had to leave because i needed more pay and more hours. I was very sad to leave."
good,"My typical day ay Home Depot was Running The FRONT-END Managing 20-30 cashiers,Making sure they were pushing credit goals and ringing up properly,Giving the best guest service"
good,"The employees are friendly. The management is friendly. Every day there is a new smile for a new reason and whenever you need help, there is always someone there to help you. For the work you do day-to-day, the pay is fair. The hardest part of the job may just be fitting everything that needs to be done within the time you are there. It's fast-paced most of the time but at nights, it slows down and you have plenty of time to get done what you need to get done. Overall a very great place to work."
good,"Pack out"
good,"As a Merchandising Execution Team Supervisor, each day has its challenges because there is so much to do within the 8 hour time frame, so time management is essential to execute your job successfully. Due to the changing culture which involves online and in-store purchasing, product merchandising is always evolving to maximize sales."
good,Productive and great place to work. On a regular day at work I would perform daily deliveries to job site or customer resident.  Management was very helpfull with getting in touch with venders. I feel that the hardest part of the lob would be trying to keep busy on a slow day.
good,"I pretty much loved everything about The Home Depot Located In Broadview, IL . Every Single Associate Is Nice And Very Helpful. The Managers Are Organized And Very Responsive To All Of Your Needs And Very Undersrandable To Personal Issues. If I Could Of Received More Hours I Would Still Be There."
good,"Working in the back office is not bad at all, prior to that I was a cashier which I did not enjoy. The other departments are cool, I guess that is the nice part you do not have to stay stuck in one department."
good,Nice place to work at. You get 2 paid breaks through out the day and a hour lunch. Sometimes a little stressful when managers were micromanaging when there not supposed to at home depot.
good,"Typical Day - very fast-paced for my role.  I was managing my department all day as well as picking up Manager on Duty shifts which covered the whole store and the employees."
good,Home depot is a great place to work i had a wonderful experience there. there  are opportunties to learn more about other departments products many people to meet you can help and learn from others

good,"Very family oriented company with great morals. Associates look out for one another, it is an overal great company to work for. Home Depot is constantly adjusting to the times and supporting its associates."
good,"A very fast paced working environment, many customers need help finding items and advice. You eventually learn about all the departments and many different items. Very rewarding."
good,"As a Cashier you are expected to be able to lift at least 50lbs.  You rotate working the front, returns and garden areas.  They offer the ability to learn about different departments for possible advancement. It was pretty laid back most of the time.  The hardest part was working in garden in mid-summer and winter, they do have time limits on the very hot days and very cold days as well as if there is a thunderstorm."
good,great place to work and meet new people never a dull moment great people to work with friendly management easy work customer friendly pay raises bonus
good,The 3 years i spent in The Home Depot were amazing! Overnight crews were exceptional to be a part of. Learned many great skills and love being a customer still!
good,In my opinion I believe that working their has its perks “depending on where you live”. I lived in Durango CO so the pay that I was getting was $13.00 an hour which is okay in my opinion; but in Charleston SC the pay for my job which was sales associate is 8-9 dollars which in my opinion isn’t enough to work their.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo ademas de hacer capacitaciones constantes
good,Fun and busy place to work. Highly competitive at times could seem cut throat. Ratings were based on results. Great people that cared about what they did and how they did it.
good,"the diversity at the Home Depot is the most interesting and fun part of working here. Most enjoyable to learn about different cultures, different ways of doing things, different experiences."
good,The whole team would get together and do a warm up or cheer. we would get assigned your trucks for the day. we would get our scanners so that our work got put into the system for competitive awards.
good,"Would go in get my apron on clock in then head back for a meeting about how much freight came in and which departments got hit the hardest then start taking out carts to there proper departments and start packing any and all freight in quick, safe, and timely manner. i learned how to work better in a quick paced work environment and how to learn the area that i'm working in allot faster. My management team were good managers that helped us learn different and faster ways to work. The hardest part of the job was whenever we had multiple trucks that came in one night that had to have most if not all taken care of before opening the store in the morning."
good,"Easy job. Decent pay and hours. Very caring and helpful managers, coworkers and company all together. Many different options when it comes too what you want to do with the company."
good,a very  cool place work because they reward your job effort and they have good work ethics . mostly everyone is nice and you don't frequently encounter your managers
good,"On freight team, you just stock shelves. It's pretty physical labor, so you'll get good exercise. My team consisted of friendly helpful coworkers and really kind supervisors."
good,"the people are amazing. just a great environment. loved working there way too much. managers are so nice. even if i made a mistake you never felt like you were in trouble they treated it more as a learning experience, was the lest stressful work environment i have been in. problems because the store runs on part timers you cane stuck with more or less hours than you want. i was woking 40 hows a week every week and getting paid as a part timer. they are very flexible with action and days off."

good,I really appreciated all the help i receieved from all the team players.For all people that didnt support me being there god has plan for yiu as well. The managers are greatand true definition of getting things ✔ done.I love the way everyobe has to do training there i t opens up your mind to not go out on the floor and be scared but prepared to do exactly what the consumers want and need.
good,"I been working here for 3 years now and I love it.  The company is very flexible when it comes to my schedule, this is my part time and management works with you to accommodate what's best for you."
good,"It`s a great place to work. The management as well as the other associates, are fun to work with. They are always open to ideas ,concepts , or your personal concerns, family, health , etc."
good,It is a great company. The downsides are the low hours upon hire and the varying hours. There is opportunity to advance in your career with this company.
good,"Great company to work for...bonuses twice a yr, attentive to needs of the employees, plenty of training and workshops to take advantage of , great processes for incentivizing employees. As a part-time employee, I only found opportunities in slow to no advancement to a  better position within the company, however, this is of no fault of the company, just bad timing with regard to the business model."
good,"An interesting fast paced job. Customer service placed first, a flexible schedule, and great benefits. Always something to do and a team environment. Rewards for effort."

good,"This is a job for retired people or young kids just looking for a part time job. If you are looking for full time you won't get it at the Home Depot. They do like to move people up in the company but that's rare. But over all it's a good company, management is great."

good,"The day to day work environment has a family atmosphere where everyone looks out for each other, which makes a friendly and comfortable work place. This is good!"
good,"Typical day of a cashier, nothing too exciting. Learned a lot of things in my position, both about the products in the store and the credit card programs offered. Management was fabulous - very generous and caring people. Helped whenever it was needed. Culture was great, never had a complaint. We had monthly trainings to keep up on our skills. The only hard part were the rude customers, which was unavoidable. Most enjoyable were my coworkers and their positive attitudes. The downside was the four hour shifts, under 20 hours per week, during the slow season, which is ultimately was made me quit and find a job with more reliable hours."
good,"Home Depot has an aggressive policy. The benefit for employees after one year is a chance to work in any part of the US, and make a lot of great friends and good contacts. Learning is on the employee, but always available, and positions from Attorneys to Zamboni do exist, and everything in between."
good,As a Store Manager it was much easier to order most anything for the customer and the quantities they would need. Hours were very long sometimes which resulted in lack of family life.
good,Being in school full time management allowed me to have a very flexible schedule. Along with that the company really cares for everyone and it really.
good,"Fun place to work as a part-time person.  If you do your job, they treat you well.  If you don't do your job, they give you many chances to overcome issues.  They are really into customer service, so should you be if you decide to become employed there.  Great benefits for a part-time person."
good,"I enjoyed it here.        If I wasn't in school I would still be there."
good,Fun place to help those in your community with their personal and dream projects. Management is really helpful with solving problems if you can't find a readily available solution to helping customers.

good,Home depot is a fantastic place to work. They do give great opportunities to move up. The people are fantastic. They teach you everything you have to know about the things you are selling. The pay is good for a job that requires no experience or education. It was a great job while I was still in school. I will be sad to leave.

good,"Positive work environment, empowering team work, fast pace work demands, support for education and promotion with in company. attracts great people. Positive management."

good,"The Home Depot, Inc. is a home improvement supplies retailing company that sells tools, construction products, and services."
good,"The hardest part of my job was getting customers to leave deposits when they weren't certain if they wanted to get flooring installed by us, otherwise it was an exciting job. I learned how to design special order blinds, special order flooring, set up measurements, and build customer relationships."
good,The culture with Home Depot was outstanding. This is a company that knows how to take care of their customers including their employees.  Hardest part of the job was being so young and not knowing leaving such a great company.
good,"Pay is not what it should be for some positions, but overall a great company and a lot of room for advancement.  Within 9 months I was able to move to a better position."
good,I'm new to the company. The people seems nice. There is a good moral amongst my fellow employees. People are eager to help you find your way. There is a lot to learn but not impossible to master.
good,I loved working at the Home Depot. The atmosphere of the workplace taught me the lesson of having a sense of urgency without being in a rush. There was no value to skipping corners to be safe but that didn't mean taking things slow to help someone out - customer or other associate.
good,A typical day of work consisted on driving to your stops and stocking shelves. Learned that you have to make decisions on your own on how to merchandise product and build displays
good,Great environment. Day to day consist of stock and prep to all aspects of customer service! I really enjoy working with people and helping to solve there issues. Hardest part of my job is when there are no customers!
good,"I worked at Home Depot for 5 years, started when I was still in high school. The best part about this job was the flexible hours. They were very willing to work around your schedule. There are opportunities to move up in the company if you are willing to work hard and put in some effort."
good,very interactive with the customers and great team work between co workers and great management team that truly cares. Hardest part is asking specific questions with customers
good,Working for Home Depot was my best job.  It was creative and interesting.  I would work for this company if I had an opportunity.  It is a great please to work during a growing economy in the city.

good,Flexible work hours. I learned a lot about lawn care. Management is supportive and open door. The culture is the best everyone is there to learn and be taught and so helpful. The hardest part of the job has to be some heavy lifting but there are some accommodations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the customers.
good,The managers I worked with are amazing. They really care about their team and make the store a really pleasant environment for both the workers and the customers by leading by example.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"to me the home depot was a great way to get a foot hold after moving from hawaii. it has given me security and they really take care of their employees, with plenty of opportunity to move laterally and up if you pursue it"
good,"They were a very good company with great core values, but they lack in their time to respond to customer needs. If they were a little bit faster I'd have 5 stars."
good,"I have been an associate at the Home Depot for almost fifteen years.  In that time I have experienced just about everything one can experience in a retail environment from good to bad.  That being said, Home Depot does indeed care about their associates and customers.  Even though at times their management (store level) are inadequate to this attitude; as a whole there is a great and often successful push to care for their associates and go out of their way for their customers."
good,a good place to gain leadership skills and self empowerment.The Home Depot is also a great place to learn home improvement techniques such as electrical application .
good,I loved working for homedepot until the end a manager had quit and once she did and few of the other managers started to become rude and disrespectful to their employees
good,Not only did this company make GRAVEYARD SHIFT something I looked forward to but their integrity and grace in dealing with their employees has so far been unmatched by any other company I've worked for.
good,"My hours would not always be set but they were always enjoyable and easy to manage. My day would start by re stocking shelves and cleaning my department. At 10 am until 2 pm we would have (power hours) where we would seek out customers to help. It was a great tool to get employees to interact with customers and to teach us that customers were always first. Management and co workers were always happy and great to work with. The worst part about the job was that it was only part time. I learned to run the flooring department, the specialty side (customer installs), cashiering where i started with the company, and many other departments. I learned to use a reach (standing forklift) and an order picker in a professional manner and was quite good."
good,My co-workers always have my back and help me as much as I can.  Mosy enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers always makes me smile and I love helping people.
good,I loved working in the seasonal department and only stopped to take the summer of for a well needed break.  We then moved to Summerland BC.  Miss working in the seasonal department and all of the associates that work at the Home Depot.  It is a great place to work where everyone cares for each other.
good,Really enjoyed my time there. Great learning experience and great teammates. Would recommend working at THD. Great support at the Little Apron's Academy
good,"The culture at Home Depot is great, the work staff is amazing and always willing to help. The management can be quite frustrating  because they are always under staffed and there are times when you are stuck working by yourself."
good,"Great company that really takes care of their employees with absolute respect."
good,"When I arrived at work I would login on the computer and then walk the floor to see if any signage needed price updates and appliances were clean. I learned to not be so shy to talk and relate to customers to give them a feeling of whatever you need I can assist you in. My co workers made things very fun and enjoyable. I was hard at times no always making sales as I'd like and getting enough people to sign up for company credit cards, but as I began to open up to the customers more I was more successful at it. It was a joy to see customers satisfied with their product and my product knowledge."
good,"The customers were nice and friendly for the most part. Assisting them with their questions on products and accessories was rewarding. Management was great and so were the coworkers. The work environment was always lively. The hardest part was sometimes assisting more than one customer at a time, but it was so nice working there that one really did't mind. The best part was ""Team Depot"" were the employees went out into the community to help enrich the neighborhood and the lift morale among everyone. We painted community rooms, planted trees and cleaned up playgrounds to name a few...really cool."
good,"Most of the time the day is busy. I love all the different people I work with. Customers are great, especially as I have been able to get to know my regulars. My manager is a wonderful, he's a people person and treats everyone with respect. My co-workers a great to work with, we all have different personalities and that is what makes it so great to work with them."

good,"As a customer service associate for Home Depot, my job was to take care of customer's needs and provide them with accurate information regarding their particular project. I learned alot about home imrovement, and customer service."
good,"Home Depot was an exceptional workplace and provided employee advancement for all. Unfortunately, the founding members exited company and new CEO restructured company at the cost of employee wages and advancement. Would not recommend a career at Home Depot unless you are okay with minimum wages and little or no advancement."
good,"I make sure all customer are first priority, oversee cash management and administrative services for the store, all sales based cash management accounting transaction and financial and management records, printing and distributing  reports ensuring the proper functioning of computers hardware/software throughout the store, inputting time and attendance information into the system."

good,"Work was blast, customers were great we did have some ups and downs with management towards the end. Due to the fact that she was new to the position and didnt see eye to eye witht he district team and the other managers,"
good,Home Depot was a fun place to work. The advancement opportunities were there and I was encouraged every day. Everyone seemed to love their job and open communication was present almost every day.
good,They not only care about their customers they care about the people they work with. They find ways to keep people coming back! They appreciate our feedback as workers and try to find a way to apply our opinions.
good,I was a cashier at first so I had to deal with a lot of money and customers needing help. Every co-worker was friendly and we always tried to help each other. Learned a lot. I ended up being a paint associate and mixed paint and made sure my files were clean and that every customer had been helped.
good,"Everything was at a fast pace. A lot of lifting products. "
good,"Fast paced fluid environment executing and managing for top Executives on a daily basis.  Great associates, fun work environment."
good,"Fantastic work environment, amazing employees, more benefits for the employee than most corporations. Managers are typically good to works with, and the company gives great training."
good,Most cashiers didn't show up for work and you would be on .Register . Like being at front of store where you got to talk with customers.Nothing really hard about it.
good,"I love working with different people, I have fun been able to assist people with there needs, even if is just getting them a new light bulb. Everyday it is a new experience because a lot people come in looking for the same item but they call it a different name depending on there culture. We have great communication because the time between the change of shift is so fast that we have to let one and other now how many lunches are missing or any break that have to be done in a time frame. The best enjoyable part of the day is where your everyday customer just want you to assist them, and if it is not you they don't want to buy nothing."
good,I love working in the environment that I do. The people that I work with are great the the job atmosphere is amazing. During the winter season we get to cut and wrap Christmas trees. To see how happy the customers are during that time is amazing. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with the group of people that I do. The hardest part is probably trying to be in 10 different places at the same time but I always make it work to where everybody gets taken care of. Management changes quite frequently at the Home Depot and they have all taught me some things along the way.
good,Job relocated I enjoyed working with my crew and learning new projects Great managers different task all the time Swing shifts a lot of over time
good,A typical day on the job would be going to your designated area and help by restocking the area that you work in such as the electrical section of the building. As the day goes on i great and help the costumes that i come into contact with. i continue this processes throughout the rest of my shift.
good,"The job at Home depot was supposed to be very temporary while I found work back as a NOC engineer or supervisor, but it lasted a few years because of the great benefits and convenience. Id work at home depot again if the pay was higher."

good,"Is a great place to work and learn. So far all good experiences with customers and co-workers. Great benefits and support from the company. Love the Home depot foundation for veteran's, always giving back to our veterans and community."
good,The day usually goes by fairly quickly because I am always being called to the registers to help with some issue or to advise cashiers about some product or store policy with which they are not familiar. Customers are also always asking questions abut products and also trying to return products so I have to constantly be jumping on a register to assist when lines get too long.Management usually tries to do anything possible to assist customers and they appreciate that we have a no hassle return policy. Associates from different departments get along really well with each other and are usually there to help out in other departments whenever possible. For me the most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction that I get to have with customers. Having a satisfied customer who leaves with a good impression of the service we offer gives me a great deal of satisfaction.
good,"Working at home Depot I learned a lot about home installation products and processes. Home Depot is a company where you have spend a lot of time with the customers in order to understand their projects.  However, you still have to be as quick as possible being that you have take care of a lot of customers.  The hardest part is being patient with everyone cause there are days where you can be over welled and you are the only person in your department.  The most enjoyable part is learning the home installation processes and products.Working with your co-workers and Management is like working with family."
good,it was a great experience to work there. I learned a lot from my managers. The work was not difficult at all. It was a great environment to work at.
good,"exciting to work with people  helping people solve problems"

good,"The home depot is a good place to work. Its an relative low stress place to work. A typical day consist of restocking shelves, helping customers and doing other task assigned by management."
good,"I traveled to numerous different stores and basically functioned in an ""undercover"" capacity.  The main goal of the job was to identify theft and take those individuals into custody."
good,"There is a great culture of teamwork and a family atmosphere amongst the associates within the company.   Compensation and benefits are second to none.  Overall, great company to work for and very stable."
good,Home Depot is a company where people are valued on a daily basis and where customer service is routinely the number one responsibility for all associates.
good,It's a great place to work for I would recommend it to anyone. The management it great and so is the rest of the corporation. they treat their employees well
good,"I love this job! However it is only part time, I am in need of full time employment. The  position I have is very diversified and challenging."
good,"Walking around home depot "

good,very friendly helpful environment and the teamwork is great. they are goal orientated. and fun to work with . you feel at home and if you don't understand something they will help and teach you.
good,"I love Home Depot. It's a great company to work for!!!  Great benefits, lots of training available. I defiently bleed orange."
good,"A typical day is always consistent. You know the time you need to be at work, when lunch is, when you get off, and what days you work.You know what you have to do each day with little instruction from the supervisor, unless a special project comes along. The management and supervisor listen and work with you no matter what issue it is you have. Co-workers are enjoyable to be around for the most part with occasional butting of heads between others. The hardest part of the job is the job itself, what is expected of you is simple enough, but perfecting it repeatedly every day can be taxing when everything runs together. The most enjoyable thing would be the reliable work days/times and the co-workers."
good,"While working for the home depot, I learned many things and feel I'm very skilled at being a cashier and doing returns. I had very good management for the most part, the only reason I left the company was because I moved and it was a far drive for me and I didn't want to relocate because I loved the Howell Michigan store."
good,"I've never seen a company with a better job culture then THD. The benefit system is great as well. Like any retail job it is hard to have perfect work life balance because your work schedule is never the same, but THD is pretty willing to work with you on that. The only real con is job security. It isn't unionized, so they can and will drop you if you aren't satisfactory. I've watched five people get hired and fired within the same month."
good,"Albeit our busiest season is the summer and slightly winter because of the christmas trees, the atmosphere that Home Depot has provided is safe, welcoming, and most of the time fun. I am a cashier however I was spot trained in garden and paint. The hardest part about the job I would say is when it becomes very slow and no customers come in. Passing the time just seems nearly impossible."
good,"Loved working for them but the five years I was there I was on night shift, and had no time for family, and no opportunity to move to days."
good,Excellent place to work. I have worked at 4 different locations. The people straight up to management are great. Everyone seems to get along and work well together creating a family type atmosphere.
good,The company is a fast paced environment where I gained knowledge about several different tools and customers.  Management is great because they focus a lot on their associates but then again it depends on what store you are currently working at.  The hardest part of the job is the returns department because that is where customers find barriers at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside coworkers and finding new ways to provide the best customer satisfaction.
good,"i am looking for a different opportunity , more benefits and something more challenging, i deal with ESVS systems, i can get very monotonous"
good,"At Home Depot, the associates and management is almost like family, so almost everyone is pretty friendly. The training is great. You do occasionally have to interact with disgruntled customers, but if you keep a positive outlook and attitude, and irate customer will easily turn into an understanding one. The health benefits are great. You can receive a bonus every 6 months and a raise every year. The vacation time is competitive with other companies, and you often feel like a valued associate."
good,"Un dia tipico llegas a surtir y acomodar mercancia e un horario determinado,despues de ese horario es solo atencion a clientes ya que es la prioridad de la empresa y se da capacitacion para lo mismo tiene una excelente cultura de atencion a cliente, aprendi demasiado desde las especificaciones tecnicas de los productos que alli se venden hasta a operar maquinaria y equipo de alzamiento,la direccion y gerencia es excelente gente preparada y calificada para el puesto muy buen equipo y ambiente se genera en empresas asi, la parte mas dificil solo es cuando comienzas que no estas tan familiarizado con los productos que se venden pero te capacitan y con el tiempo te vuelves experto, lo que mas me gusto en realidad fue todo es de las pocas empresas donde me ha gustado laborar y hay un excelente ambiente laboral."
good,"I have always loved shopping at Home Depot, now that I have worked there I am more impressed with them.  They truly do care about their employees and their customers.  "
good,"I look up product on computer for customers, answer phone, process orders. Also make sure customer has received their orders and everything went well with delivery. Management is great, no problems and enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is getting someone to help pull appliances for customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to satisfy the customer."
good,"Home Depot was a great place to work, my co workers were nice, supervisors always made you feel like you mattered. Fast paced and just a overall great place to work. Flexible hours made it a joy to do."
good,"Good place to work, but I need more hrs. This is a good place to work. management is very good. The Greenville store is the best place I have worked."
good,"I like my part-time weekend job at Home Depot. I am just searching for a full time weekday job with benefits, including full health coverage."
good,"A day at the office is sometimes pretty busy with the customers asking for typical items that they want, need and must have to make their gardening look fantastic or their inside of their house feel amazing. Always learning new ways to make our jobs at all times. Now for the management is their to help guide, and make sure we our at our best always. Co-workers are fun to be around because we have the best of times just watching people come into the store and sometimes they make us laugh. There is no hard part of the job which i can point out. Just having a good time."
good,"Working there was good. no hassle. Learned a lot about customer service, Co-workers all worked together and were very nice. Hardest part of job was getting to all calls at the same time, most enjoyable part was just being there. its a great environment."
good,"I look forward to going to work each day, as the Home Depot Family is a great team.  I have learned many skills about excellent customer service.  Most co-workers are very helpful."
good,"A typical day at Home Depot - Clock in, go to your assigned department, give the best customer service you could provide, every day was different."
good,"Having to deal with customers who are upset off the bat can be hard at times but with the training received, its actually very easy. Placing orders for Home depot customers who are not to computer savvy is what my day consisted of. Checking in with my supervisor was rare due to the software's I am trained and efficient in. Although when needed, it was always pleasant and easy to understand. The most difficult part of the day would be when trying to locate a package for the customers and none of the systems would show the package. yet there is always a way to resolve the issue the customer is having, which i did 100% of the time, never being escalated to a supervisor. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of my position was ending the call. I always made sure our customers were more than satisfied and willing to recommend us and use Home Depot's service again. 100% satisfaction was the goal and I achieved that."
good,"The work day at The Home Depot Quote Center starts at 5 am PST and goes until 3:30 pm PST to provide excellent special order customer service for Home Depot store associates during their work hours.  We help store associates at the contractors desk find special order product, manufacturers, and prices.  We also work to solve special order problems that arise, helping to satisfy customers. "
good,Overnight Work Restocking All The Aisles And At 12pm I went Scanning All Products For Inventory Cleaning The Store Palletizing And Forklift Driving To Put Pallets in Shelfs
good,"Home Depot is a fantastic place to work. Great company, flexible hours, good benefits, great management and a fun work environment."
good,Always got to meet new people and learn new things.The management was always on top of everything keeping the store perfect.Overall home depot is a good work environment.
good,This job was everything I was expecting. It was hard at first but it was enjoyable experience. I have had a chance to grow within the company and I love working at the store
good,"Very friendly people work here and are very helpful, management is usually really great and has quick feedback.  A typical day at work usually is unloading a freight a truck and then seeing what can or can not fit on the shelves and just getting everything put away and organized while helping customers. The hardest part about it was probably getting used to the graveyard shift I work.  Most enjoyable is definitely the people you work with."
good,Hard worker. Customer service representative and reliable worker. Special order for customer in need of merchandise not at the store. Forklift operator and order picker for lifting heavy merchandise.
good,"a typical day at work is never typical.there is always something new and existing to do and room to learn.I learned how to adapted and over come many problems.the end results were satisfied customers and employers.management is top notch in both fields i have displayed.always willing to help.my co-workers are the best at what they do.besides work there is always a shoulder to lean on.the hardest part is not the job,but overcoming your own mind.sky`s the limit,if you push your self hard enough ,you can achieve anything.I`ve  really never had a job i did not enjoy.life is a learning experience and if you can get past your own fears,there`s no telling where you can go."
good,"Great corperation to work for.. Little to much politics ... Good enviroment for learning , and advancement ! Working day to day was fun and seamingly different, hardley repetitive. Meeting new people , teaching, learning and helping made it all worth it.."
good,"Working at Home Depot, I have many opportunities to interact with different types of personalities, people, children, coworkers, and even product we provided to sell. I was able to achieve my forklift licence of three different types of lifts; the lumber lift, regular sit down forklift, and Reach. There was no lack of management, and order. Home Depot has Department heads for every department, and a manager above them as well. The Home Depot is very diverse and gives everyone an equal opportunity to thrive and grow within the company. The hardest part of my position working at The Home Depot would have to have been the physical aspect. This job requires you to lift 5 gallon buckets of paint multiple times throughout the day. The hand carts helped, and so did my coworkers. So with teamwork we took our hardships and made them easier for each other.  The most enjoyable part of working for the Home Depot would have to be the seasonal changes. Working in a warehouse during the holidays and seeing all the different decor, and helping customers improve their home, come back and provide before and after pictures gave me great satisfaction."
good,"The company promote employees moving around the company so no one stays stagnant.  It is a great environment for someone who wants growth opportunities.  However, you need to be comfortable seeing people around you getting promotions because you will receive email announcements all the time.  I don't mean this in a bad way, but it might affect someone who's competitive in nature and would create unwanted stress and affect his/her focus on the current position.  In return, you will also receive the same opportunities, the trick is to understand how you will establish yourself, make yourself known and network."
good,"A typical day was very busy. I had to work quick and efficiently to make sure the register and vault balanced. I worked closely with management to fix problem with the vault, I worked with the Supervisor of the front end to make sure they had everything they needed. "
good,Overall I loved working for Home Depot. I had a great time working there and loved my co-workers. The only draw back was there were not enough benefits.
good,"Day to Day if Fine, just could not get enough hours, did not coordinate well with other job"
good,Great place to work at as well as great people to work for.Theirs really nothing hard about working here.Coming from c&s grcers trained me to have a good working drive.
good,"Great place to work. Good supervisors, great environment. Pay could be better. Overall, good experience. Would recommend this job to others"
good,our home depot store is the lowest payed in the district. I love the fact that even part timers can get dental and vision insurance. Problem is as a MEA we get payed less for doing two parts of a job than another MET team doing one part of the job. If we got payed more it would better but I love the work and the store itself.
good,fun work place really enjoy the customers and co- workers. good management too.Looking forward to learning  more on being a Home Depot associate and taking advantage of all the great benefits they offer to employees.
good,"Its a great place to work if you are like me and you love tools and working with your hands. I was in charge of the hardware department and the tool section. I learned a lot there dealing with contractors, and interacting with the customers. The best part of the job for me was the knowledge I acquired there."
good,very interesting job where you interact with all types of people. Most employees work as a team to make sure costumers are always satisfied
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. I love working with my co-workers. I learned a lot about customer service from working at Home Depot and working at Dick Sportings goods

good,"really great place to work, everything is what you would expect. Great working environment, awesome co workers. they are really easy going and always provide their coworkers with moving up in the company and expanding their knowledge as a home depot associate."

The philosophy demonstrates knowledge that nurturing and supporting employees has an impact on achieving the company's short and long term goals.

Not one day goes by when I am not offered the opportunity to learn and develop skills and talents to succeed in my position and advance in my career. The particular store I work for stands by the principles Home Depot is committed to and I am better for being able to be part of that."
good,"I enjoyed working for home depot, all the people were pleasant to work with.  My job in lawn and garden was enjoyable and different everyday."
good,lots of company activities and parties bonuses werent so great pay was alright and hours were good management was mor of a show of picking favorites because all the same people would get rewarded and moved up
good,"Great company with plenty of opportunities for advancement. Work/Life balance is a struggle. Great associates always make the job enjoyable, incredible training."
good,"At the Reading Home Depot, I worked in the garden department. My duties were to stock shelves, make them look neat, water plants, service customers, put away returns, make price signs, assemble grills and lawn mowers (occasionally), and make sales. I was able to make my own hours, so I could work around my school schedule. Every weekend day that I worked, I clocked in, put my apron on, and went out to find customers. In the later hours and more so on weekdays, we would focus on stocking shelves. The managers were fair, hardworking, and dedicated for the most part. I got along very well with all of my coworkers. The hardest part was dealing with a rude customer, but I never said anything rude to a single one. The best part was when a customer was genuinely grateful for my help. Even though it was just a retail job, I took customer satisfaction seriously and even had a few regulars that I knew by name. The only reason I left was because my school schedule got busy, and I had my PCA job, so I had to drop something."
good,"A typical day at work in the Merchandising Execution Team is very similar like the day before. The work becomes rather repetitious, but never boring. That is in big part due to the wonderful team I work with. I walk away from work everyday having learned something new, whether its in plumbing, electrical, ect. My manager always seem to have our best interest at heart. He is very fair and by the book. My coworkers are the best. Those guys have a strong work ethic and such dedication to their job. I cant say enough good things about them. Very fortunate to have a great team. The hardest part of my day is when there isn't enough help on the floor to take care of all the customers need in a timely manner. Doesn't usually happen often, but the times it does its rather hectic. As for the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I was able to help a customer with whatever problem they needed help with."

good,"For a giant ""big box"" corporation, The Home Depot is an excellent career choice with almost unlimited advancement opportunity. Some of the highest officials have humble origins in the company, as far back as entry level positions. Every day there offers new challenges and the business moves fast to stay competitive. You constantly learn on your feet, from peers, to training, and even customers. The hardest part of the job is the many hats you wear every day to keep up with changing promotions, seasons, training, and above all, customer relations and service. With all the hard work comes the daily satisfaction of assisting customers and knowing you had a positive impact on their projects and shopping experience."

good,"Helping customers with purchases in store, placing orders and ensuring it's the correct product for the project, answering questions for the customers that have limited knowledge about home repair. The hardest part of the job would be working with customers who can never be satisfied. It's enjoyable to help and educated customers that want to fix something by themselves when they have limited knowledge in that area."

good,"This job offered a very good balance of labor and technical duties. From the start of the day I accessed the Citrix system to look up orders by date, customer, or part. Orders had to be pulled and staged and then located back into the Citrix system to communicate the status to other key personnel."

good,It was a hard working environment. Great co-workers. the hardest part of the job was when you are the only one in the department and have a lot of customers needing help and no one would be there to help you
good,"A typical day at work after clocking in, and going to my department, is usually busy afterwards. I learn new thing everyday of the week from my peers to customers. The hardest part of the job is jus keeping the store ""open ready"" while assisting other customers when you're alone in the department.

The support from peers and management in this store is always nice to see, they stand behind us 100% with whatever challenge comes our way.

good,Home Depot is by far one of the best places I have worked for in a long time.  I have met some really nice people here and I would say its more like a family setting.
good,"I worked here most of my adult life, its hard to sum of that many years in a few words. I did everything from clerical to unloading rail cars, both flat and box cars. Daily I performed either shipping or receiving duties, many times flip flopping between both based warehouse needs. I learned so much over the years and intended to be supervisor but growth at the bulk DC level in my area did not allow the opportunity to actually take place."
good,"Most enjoyable part of working at Home Depot is the people.  Co-workers and management , and customers are all part of your full day.

good,"Home Depot is a great place to work for. They care about their employees more than any other job I've been in. The management team is generally very patient and helpful. My co-workers for the most part are friendly and willing to provide assistance. A typical day for me is to come in and go to a short meeting about what our night has in store for us. We then go and work the freight on to the shelves quickly and accurately. Once freight in finished or near completion it is my responsibility to scan the outs for the departments assigned for each day of the week. The hardest part of my job is getting the large spools of electrical wire onto the electric ladder and then into the overheads. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we all balance out the seriousness of our job with making it fun,"
good,"Very decent work environment, workmates are friendly, they try to accommodate your needs to the best. I recommend working for the Home Depot."
good,"With greeting every customer with a smile, I inquire about their current and future projects to ensure that customers are satisfied with their service. Assigned to a specific department, I have become knowledgeable of the products and services that The Home Depot provides, while completing assigned tasks. These tasks include bay maintenance, correcting hazards, maintaining in-stock appearance, and providing great customer service. The managers at The Home Depot are very understanding and supportive of any concerns I may have, and are easily approachable when help is needed. My co-workers are always helpful when needed, and greet customers with confidence and a bright smiles. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see customers leave with a happy smile; their appreciation for the dedication of assisting them from start to finish is always a pleasure."

good,"sales associate and all costumer service requirements"
good,"At Home Depot you have the capability to learn something new each and every day.  One day I may work in plumbing, appliances, kitchen design, cutting blinds or making a purchase order. Home Depot is a company that support their employees while they work.  They have an excellent training staff that educates the employee to be able to answer technical questions about products. Example: sent me to kitchen design school until I was able to provide customer service with excellent customer services information for the product I was selling."

good,Lot associate position at the Home Depot is a busy job. It definitely builds your ability to critically think and time manage. The hardest aspect of the job is to prioritize various duties as they come up and complete them all in a timely manner.
good,"I look at the day's work load and determine the priorities to complete the jobs in a timely manner. Often times it requires two people to complete a task as products are heavy and/or bulky.  Also, two people required when using lift equipment.  Management, for the most part, allows me(us) the freedom to do our job as we see fit.  There are always co-workers willing to assist when necessary.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with out-of-stock merchandise, however, with many other Home Depot's in the area the situation is easily overcome.  I enjoy most the camaraderie of the many other associates and supervisors."
good,"A great job for anyone seeking to break into the retail world. A resume boost since The Home Depot is the world-renown, recognized leader in home improvement, home furnishings and contractor equipment. A one-stop shop for all things remodeling and interior design, as well as most things involving the outside of the house, patios and yards. Very diverse and competitively-priced merchandise and services, including installations and deliveries. A well-organized Buy Online/ Pickup IN Store (BOPIS) service that alleviates any shipping/ handling woes. Very useful merchandise during the spring, summer holiday and winter holiday seasons. Management can differ per store location and experience/ expertise. Some of the management are more accessible regarding particular tasks and queries about the store. Some of the management work with the overnight staff a lot more than others. Education background is a plus, but does not guarantee wage increase or quicker promotions. Advancement is very key and is a realistic possibility within this store and its franchises."
good,"Home Depot is a great work place. Good multi-cultural environment. Learned how to be a great supervisor, multi-task, customer servoce skills.

It is a recession proof company as Home Repair and upkeep will always be in demand. Advancement is quick if you follow your performance review with its recommendations.

good,Worked in the lumber department while going to College helping customers select their building materials for their projects.
good,"Social interaction and advocating for others has always been a trait of mine. Since early childhood, I have always interjected on other’s behalves, and stood up for those I believed wronged. My work history reflects this characteristic as well, as management dominates most of my positions. Managing gave me an ingress to championing for the employees rights, and so I have always held such positions; as they had me interacting directly with people on a visceral level. Realizing the potential for this gift, I have fostered my love for social advocation, and it is now the motivation for both my personal and professional goals."
good,"As a delivery puller, your day to day activities include pulling customers orders and preparing them for delivery or for will call.

good,"Home Depot is a great company with great corporate culture. I have been a part time associate for about 9 years. I have been offered full time positions on several occasions; but they pay is not where I need it to be. I'd take a pay cut to work there full time, but not too big of a pay cut."
good,"A typical day at work was either fast-paced or slow. There really wasn't any in between and as a cashier, you were placed anywhere your head cashier tells you to go such as at self checkout, returns, or in garden."
good,You learn a lot of helpful ideas and information from the classes the company provides on line and also from the store itself as you learn about each area.  I met several co-workers who have remained friends and I am grateful for that.  The most difficult part of the job was the fluctuating hours. The most enjoyable thing was working and meeting new people through customer services.  I enjoy interacting with people and assisting where I could.

I learned that there's many different types of blinds/curtains, much more than I knew about at least, available to pick and choose from. The Management team was always helpful as well as willing to lend a helping hand. My co-workers were also helpful and definitely took pride in their jobs.

good,"great company with fantastic benefits "
good,Clock in and start organizing the back until trailers with product arrives. Unload the trailers and break down the pallets and set in them in the proper placement so the freight team can work it. Was taught how to key-rec and receive merchandise from different companies.Taught how to use every heavy machinery that was located in the store. Hardest part of the job would be having to provide knowledge of products to customers but that would also be the most enjoyable part because i would learn about that product so that customer would not leave disappointed.

good,Overall I feel as if the best thing about The Home Depot was my co-workers.  Schedule is all over the place but that is to be expected with retail.  I was moved to a permanent schedule after about 6 months that included weekends off.  It is rare to get a full time position.

good,"As a team we would change price tags for the ad. Exchange displays when needed. Clean, organized and stocked merchandise. Our manager had to been the best manager by far. He was very funny but also very strict. He made anyone great at their job. The hardest part about the job was being there at 5am but you get use to it. The best part was being out by 1:30pm and still having the rest of the day to take care of things u need too."

good,"Provided excellent customer service as well as answering phones, cash handling and fast paced transaction processing. I learned a lot about teamwork and how to handle different types of customers in an appropriate manner. Management as well as employees were absolutely wonderful to work with. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is learning product knowledge and dealing with the upset customers. I enjoy the atmosphere of the job as well as the customer service."
good,Working at The Home Depot has been a very fulling experience. My typical work day entails greeting customers that enter my department as well as throughout the store. I've actually learned a lot while building my career here and continue to learn more each shift that I work. My co-workers are awesome we are all team players with the same common goal which is to make sure our customers have a pleasant shopping experience. The hardest part in my opinion would be keeping a cool demeanor after dealing with an unpleasant customer. The most enjoyable part would be knowing i've provided excellent customer service to my customers and that they will return to my store instead of traveling to our competition.
good,I love being around and working with the customers at the Home Depot. I love to see the customer leave with a smile on there faces.
good,"everything can be great until they start to ask the impossible from the associates. But daily routines are good and normal duties goes with out saying. working as a team was a bit difficult at times, but easy if everyone puts in the effort."
good,"Pro:"
good,really good company. really care about the workers. great attitudes from management
good,"Working the service desk requires patience as you tend to deal with upset customers. Outside of that, as a Department Head, not only did I manage my team, but I oversee all special orders and deliveries that come in and out of the store. I am responsible for keeping up with store inventory and handling weekly shrink plans for operational departments. "
good,Home Depot is the best company I ever worked for by far. I always say that their my home depot family. Its a diverse company and they pride themselves on welcoming different cultures. I love that about the company. There was not bad day at home depot. they always went above and beyond for not only the customers but for employees as well....They were team players.

There is nothing in this job which is hard because I enjoy each and everything about this job. Meeting project deadline, helping customers and always trying to achieve the most we can."
good,"Added Good experience in Retail Domain,Good Learning on Pro Finance area and business"
good,"Always learning something new each day was exciting and interaction with customers gives you a great respect for people and customer service.  A typical day would be starting the day off with a safety check of your department, conduct a daily opening meeting to gather information and guidance for the day.  Walk your department to prepare for customers by making sure your area is fully stock, organized and clean.  The middle of day you will be seeking customers to assist them in making their shopping experience one to remember.  Management lead by example and set the atmosphere for being the number one home improvement retail in the nation."

good,I went to Home Depot not knowing anything about proper floor care and came out being a specialist
good,Great potential to grow. Great rewards and good benefits. You can start on the bottom and grow to run the store. Being a Department Supervisor is like running your own business.
good,A very fast paced work environment with multiple opportunities to learn and grow with the company. Company seems to however hire a lot of associates with no prior experience in the home improvement field. Very few people had true hands on knowledge to be able to assist the customers. However training did compensate for this in some areas.

good,"I loved working here, the customers are amazing, very easy to move up but a lot of favoritism."
good,Fun work place. Manager was a pain. Had no respect for his employees work ethics. Leaders seem not to care about employees wanting more labor work when demanded.
good,"Work environment where you are able to challenge yourself to learn new departments, procedures, and new ways to do things. You are allowed to use your entrepreneurial spirit.  We are able to encompass some core values.  We are able to say yes to customers and fix there issues without being challenged by management on why we made a decision.  Co workers work well together.  The most enjoyable part about my job is making a difference in people's day."

good,"I started out with The Home Depot as a cashier and later became Special Services which I kept doing till I left. The people are the most enjoyable part of the business. Everyone got along with everybody else. It's a extended family. I was multitasked individual anything you needed I found for you. Home Depot had no limitations; we choose to improvise and find a way to be satisfactory even if someone wasn't they still shopped at our store because we are known to be friendly. As a side note: (Sometimes things aren't produced as long as we hoped they would be on the shelf. I guess it has to do with the market and what needs need to be met on basis of selling products. Everything is regulated to consumers and new models are sure to come out.) There wasn't anything to hard to overcome and I was sure glad our days were kept at 16 to 18 hours as far as the store was opened since everyone needs a life outside the store culture. "
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, they are willing to work with you on any problems that may occur and they treat the employees like people and not machines. They are very organized and allow for growth within the company."
good,"It s a fast paced work environment as the doors are opened. There is little margin for error while excellent customer service is required every minutes."

I loved the opportunity that Home Depot provided to me to branch out and be all I could be...It not only made me have a successful career of 16 years but it also has made me successful in my personal life, on how to treat others and never judge or be inconsiderate..."

Contacts the Head Cashier or other members of management, if customer needs are not met. I monitor and maintain the Self-Checkout area and process return transactions, as assigned. Proactively seeks product and project knowledge to provide customers with information and identify selling opportunities.

Each associate has the responsibility of providing a safe working and shopping environment by following all safety policies and standards, completing specified safety training, immediately correcting hazards and unsafe conditions or reporting conditions to the Manager On Duty, and working safely as not to endanger themselves, co-workers, vendors, or customers."
good,"Facing product and making sure it is neat, clean, organized and in the right spot. I've learned a lot about product that i've never even heard of. I've learned how things work for all sorts of jobs and cleaning metarials. Co-workers are excellent and out going. They work the same hours and do the same work so it's wonderful to have all that in common with people you see almost every day. The hardest part of the job is to not spend as much time as we'd like in each bay and on each product. The most enjoyable part is being time and goal oriented, striving to reach the goal amount and go above and beyond the standards."
good,The Home Depot provides exceptional training for employees. They are aware of employee skills and quick to encourage more training and provide the opportunity for growth.
good,"Working for The Home depot, at my specific store was a very good learning experience. i was given the opportunity to advance and lead. the trust that was issued to me was something I enjoyed and handled with great responsibility. it saddens me I had to leave The Home Depot due to having to leave the state, but In the end I learned so much there and that's what counts."

good,I have had so many wonderful experiences in my short time with home Depot. My managers and more seasoned staff are a great help. The training materials and access to product tests in order to advance are readily available and are comprehensive.
good,Home Depot was a great part time job looking for their employees to better themselves at work and in life. Co-workers and management work as a team and when times get tough efficiency picks up with the volume of customers. The hardest part of the job was helping those customers with problems that could not be resolved peacefully. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team when the volume of people coming in the store picked up.
good,"Very busy with customers."
good,"Great co-workers, except for the occasional lazy ones. The job was usually either simple or was well explained. I learned the best ways to communicate with others. The hardest part of the job was keeping the lot clean of carts. The best part of the job, honestly, was the loading. Just seeing the smiling face of a customer that says, ""Thanks for the help man!"" made me feel accomplished. Management was fairly strict about certain things, but as long as the job got done, there were no complaints. They were also very friendly to me and always tried to engage in anything I was doing."

good,"Always something to do, good job for someone who works well under pressure. Clocked in at 6:30 am clocked out at 2:30 pm, signed onto register and rang up cutomers. Kind of repetetive, but once in a while you get a new task to manage. You train new employees, overall great company to work for. Pay goes up based on your time there."
good,"I have enjoyed working for home depot, its a great place to work. The associates and management are excellent, I am just seeking and looking for more."
good,Overall a good company but sometimes standards are not equal to all personnel that work.
good,"On any given day, an 8 hour work day could start any hour from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., with 10 a.m.- 2 p.m. being focused solely on the customer (no cleaning or organizing). Work days included lots of moving and physical activity. There was a lot of interaction between people, in the form of customers (aiding do-it-yourself people gain better knowledge of their project and helping contractors find what they needed in a timely manner) and coworkers (reorganizing store shelves, working together to ensure a safe environment when the forklift is in use)."
good,H.d. is a at-work-family. Great place to work. Caring & helpful place when in need. Lots of advancement.
good,"A typical day is not defined. A typical day can include any issue or no issue. The thrill that Home Depot provides is that it is fast paced, values hard and smart work and puts one in a position to value add."
good,They are very flexible with my time. They are friendly and were very welcoming when I first started working here! Unlimited opportunities to learn as much as you can around the store!!
good,"Everyday was a good one. Amazing co-workers, managers and corporate. I want to say the hardest part of the job was getting sign-ups my first couple weeks and traffic when I clocked out. I enjoyed mostly everything about Home Depot. Especially when they BBQ lunch for the store. Getting to meet all kinds of people was pretty fun/interesting."
good,"I am new to this position and I like the job but the MET overnight manager needs improvement. Her people skills are horrible, she yells a lot"
good,"Most of my experience was working in grocery stores; sacking , cleaning toilets, and eventually got to work in deli slicing meats. Unfortunately the stress was overwhelming. Mostly due to managers and availability. Until i worked for Home Depot, Note*i am glad for my experience with working with the other stores * . Home Depot offers a lot of benefits as well as other great opportunities."
good,Was a fast pace environment that was friendly and fun. Customer service was the main focus of all employee.
good,"Help people with any problems they were having, and helping them find a solution to their needs.  Learned to not be afraid to ask more questions so that you could better help the customer.  Managers were always busy so if you had any questions that you could not answer or a customer wanted to speak to a mngr. it was hard to get a hold of them.  Co-workers were for the most part great and friendly, with the exception of the know it all's, and made work enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was communicating with the customers in order to actually find what they were asking for.  The part of the job that was most enjoyable was the frequent customer contact and interactions."
good,"A typical work day for me would be arriving to work and checking my area to make sure we have the products available for customers as the come into the store. Next will be greeting and providing great customer service to all customers as they enter the store."

My management team is awesome and always whilling to help me.The hardest part of my job would be standing on concrete for 8 hours.

good,"I learn how to mix paint and take orders from customers with a specific color for there home, work and school project. Management Is good pressure for sales and keeping work area tidy. My co-workers are great and good communication, the hardest part of my job is to keep everything stock on the floor while helping customers In between. And my enjoyable part of the job is to meet new people and to walk around working while you help customers."
good,Easy going workplace . Management needs improvement .Customer is always right
good,"I think the Home Depot in Fort Saskatchewan is a great place to work, the environment is great and the people are amazing.  Managers have given me opportunities I didn't know were possible at my age. They helped me grow and learn, I truly appreciate everything they did for me there. They have great benefits and good wages.  Sadly I have choose not to do this for a career and am looking for different new things to try. The only thing I would like to see changed is how much staff work there, because of the plants that are 5 minutes outside of town there is more staff moving to those then staying at the Depot.  Is a great place to work overall and would recommend it for anyone look for great opportunities."
good,"My day I arrive at 5AM and do a ""stretch & flex"" to relax muscles to avoid strains, muscle ""pulls"", and to energize your mind and body."
good,I started as a lot boy and moved to floors and walls then moved to floor specialist and then pro desk specialist in 1 year had so much fun learning new things daily

good,"Overall a good job. Enjoyed the people i worked with, the customers, and the work place. It was easy to keep busy between helping customers and stocking merchandise. The managers appreciated hard work and gave credit to those who deserved it."
good,"My typical day at work as Lot Associate was based on helping customers load/unload merchandise, help customers find merchandise, help other associates with needed tasks, and clean the parking lot. I learned/improved my customer skills as well as public speaking. I learned to work as a team to help customers and give them the best possible customer service. I had fun with the co-workers that i had. We help each other and learned from each other. The hardest part was when the lost got full of shopping carts in busy days and i will have to try to clean as much as possible as fast as i could while still helping customers and other associates. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and making short conversations with them."
good,I honestly love working here at the Home depot there's so many opportunities to advance within the company. Everyone is nice and caring most of the time. Most associate in the Home-depot likes to see new associates progress. Its a great learning experience

good,customer service taking care of the customer great environment I learn how to be a team player
good,My day to day was always busy. Constantly pulling data and creating new training materials for new products. As well as maintain the integrity of the old training material for new employees. Built good business relationships within other Departments. The hardest part of the job is sometimes retrieving the necessary data needed from other departments so I compile my spreadsheets for the monthly managers meeting
good,Absolutely enjoy working for this company. Always busy and productive. Great team and management. Plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement.
good,"Gracias a esta empresa tuve la oportunidad de conocer conceptos como layout, labor, payroll, mercandising, entre otros para una eficiente administracion de locales de retail."
good,"Working in the paint department of The Home Depot was sometimes a little rough but if you ever need help or back-up just call and someone will come running. That's how amazing the staff is at The Home Depot, we're all family. Basically everything was very manageable but if you couldn't keep up with the pace of your job dept. you fell by the way side and are eventually fired or will quit. The hardest part of the job was that the store is usually always packed with customers so you don't always get to take necessary breaks on time, but you will at least have one break before your shift is over. The top hardest departments in my opinion are Cashier and Paint. Cashier being that they deal with every customer who comes from every department in the store. Paint is usually sold in large quantities to contractors or people painting large projects meaning large orders from anywhere between 10-30 minutes or multiple small orders of 3-10 minutes per customer, which always causes long lines and occasionally, due to scheduling, you or just you and a co-worker may be left to handle a line wrapping around the desk or traveling down your aisles. I used every opportunity to help people to the best of my abilities by helping as many people as who come to the store in just one day. Working in customer service I've learned to better respect every individual and their personal needs. The only way to do that was to do research, learn about what you're selling and sometimes what other stores are selling to direct a person to where they can find the product that will best help them to complete their"
good,Met some of the best people at this job. I learned so much about people and customer service.
good,"I have a schedule, sometimes my shift change by month;"
good,I worked as an electrical/hardware sales associate for three years plus. I don't have anything bad to say about the home depot. I learned a great deal on product knowledge and sales know how. The co-workers were great and the management was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed my work experience at The Home Depot
good,Everyday I will start my with my team and we will see what price changes have made and want new is coming up.
good,"A typical day is slow in the morning, fast in the afternoon then slows down again in the evening until last second shoppers get to the register. I learned a lot about cashiering since I was new, their is a lot I can do down at returns and a lot of freedom in garden. My co-workers are great and funny at times and management does their best to make you feel at home. The hardest part though is doing a job that requires you to say and do the same thing with every customer every day while not seeming board."
good,I Work mostly with contractors and since I have a set schedule I see the same ones everyday so I've been able to build great customer relationships with them. At my store coworkers are amazing and enjoyable to work with which makes the workplace enjoyable to be around.
good,Enjoyed my time at the job wish the company had not relocated.
good,"Hardly ever a boring day, Very fast paced, and organized. "
good,"The busy atmosphere and creative customers and co-workers made this job a complete joy, every day that I worked. There was ALWAYS something you could learn how to do or what plants/flowers to grow for the Georgia climate."
good,"Great place to work, strong company...... Managers are promoted before they are ready. The ones that deserve it don't always get a fair chance to promote"
good,Fun interaction with customers who i see on a daily basis. Most Enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers. I learn many different aspects of construction.
good,"I learn something new everyday and offer customers my guidance and wisdom anyway I can. Assisting customers and seeing to their needs is my top priority at The Home Depot. The company values and core morale is directed to Customers First, and I work to adhere to that."
good,"This is a job I took after early retirement to fill in some time."
good,"See the customer service desk is where all the returns would come and so we would do returns. I desk is also the place where the customers would come for all of their special orders, contractors would pick up their merchandise. Calling customers that would come in and we would give them a quote on some merchandise that they were interested in purchasing to see if they have decided in getting it. My work environment was awesome the people I work with was fun no matter have stressful the day may get or frustrated the customers may have got with us we would always help each other get the issue solved and work out. The most stressful day for me was I am at the desk by my self and I have a line of customers that isn't what bothered me it was the fact that I pulled a customers order and in the home depot system says was there and call down to receiving and the order isn't in the location that is imputed in the computer so I have the customer for the will call getting mad at me and not to mention the customers that i had waiting to return and buy merchandise. I informed the customer what was going on and immediately check out all the customer that I had and found someone to watch the desk and for the customers merchandise in receiving as the system originally said and brought it out.Helping people is what i like to do it make me feel like I have made someones day that my have been bad up in to that point."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity because it allowed me to expand my knowlege in many areas of Supply Chain.
good,"Started out part time ,went full time and became dept supervisor, Worked in all departments. And transferred out with no problem.My only complaint is their policies are too ridgid, they should be more flexible for different situations."
good,"I love what i did at home depot i met different types of people,some of who'm if still friends with.I learned in different dept.I learned how to deal with different attitudes in a very calm way,yet got the job done in a friendly way,and a smile.my managers were great and very understanding to every one.most of them were single parents like a lot of us that worked there.my co-workers was cool too,we worked together as a team.the only hard part was being on your feet the whole shift.I enjoyed working there a lot,maybe i should not have left.The grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence."
good,"I enjoy working hard and this place helps facilitate that. Home Depot certainly gives you enough work to stay busy and there is little down time. Management is also very relaxed if they know that you'll get the job done. They will have hard-working employees back until the end. I love helping out the local community find exactly what they need to get their projects done (whether it's commercial or residential). Hardest part of the job would probably be memorizing the vast inventory we carry, but with time you come to learn exactly what is needed with every problem that arises. Most enjoyable part of the job is repairing tools, getting customers the right product, and general maintenance."
good,If you like a good up beat place to work Home Depot is the place to be.
good,Good job security and company that cares about their employees
good,"The people are respectful and don't ask for to much. I've learned to do tie downs with rope and plastic. I have learned how to assist customers in a friendly manner.I get along very well with my co workers. The hardest part of the job is remembering the task you're given. Luckily for me, I keep a notepad just in case I forget what I'm suppose to do."
good,"prepare goals for the day/week ensure numbers by dept. are ready for the day, checking all associates are ready for daily task, associates are on top customers needs"
good,This company is good over all. but some stores have a management that holds employees back and also have had some tell lies to new hires.
good,I learn how to work w a fork lift it was comfusing at first but then it ws like any other . it was really fun working for home depot everybody was really lovely and friendly everythinhg I did on that job ws fun there were not a single part that I didn't like.
good,"My experience was great; however, because of an unfortunate blemish on my record, I was release of my duties."
good,"This company office closed after one year of being open. Howecer, this was by far the best place I have worked, Great hoiurs and pay and most importantly allowed me to balance work and family."

good,You have to take the opportunity on learning on how to become a better customer service rep....good job on training class
good,"The Home Depot is a fast paced, customer service oriented environment where you hit the floor running as soon as you arrive. Organization and the ability to multi-task are a must have, as well as a smile and great customer service skills."
good,Everyday is a new day in relations to meeting/helping customers and working the sales floor.  The interest part of the job is being able to learn something on a daily basis be it from a co-worker by sharing their knowledge on a specific item or from a customer give you a different perspective on a product item.
good,A Typical day for me at The Home Depot is fast paced yet mainly focused on customer service. Since I have been employed I have worked my way up from Cashier to Special services greeter and I have been trained in Leadership and Special services. There is not a day that goes by that I'm not learning how to take care of different customer needs and also enjoying what I'm doing. I love interacting with the public and people and I would have to say that's the most enjoyable part of my job. My co-workers and the management team are always there to help and uplift each other.
good,very good company to work for competitive wages and plenty of opportunity for advancement
good,This is one of the best jobs I have worked. The people i worked with were very accommodating about personal life and the balance a full-time job takes. They worked with me on college courses and schedules and were willing to make changes when my schedule changed. The pay while low is better than a lot of places and the company clearly has upward possibilities. It takes some time to reach promote ability but there are always positions open as long as one is not tied to only one location in a city.
good,I worked in the paint department mixing paints and assisting customers.
good,Home Depot was a great job!  It truly was a great lost to our city.  The management team was very professional and the open door policy was awesome.

good,"Typical day at work was making sales in order to meet sales quota. Loading/unloading cust merch, making quotes, answering phone calls, answering e-mails, ringing up customers so there's no lines of waiting. I learned alot about team work & that there are still good people left in this chaotic world. As for management, asst. mgr., really didn't think that they got involved much & some of the ones I dealt w/ was mainly to talk to me about me doing something wrong. My direct supervisor was an awesome boss always on top of everything, helpful, & tolerant w/ explaining on how to build things. The hardest part I guess I would say was loading heavy material as in shingles, plywood...The most enjoyable part of the day was working w/ customers & coworkers. I'm a real people person & we had alot of that there. Everyone, coworkers, were always upbeat & very helpful at all times."
good,Management direction for maximizing daily operations.  Excellent opportunity for development.

good,"a typical day at work would consist of a lot of customer questions about different departments, looking for order items restocking receipt paper clearing the lot, assisting customers with loads that need to be secured, phone answering and general great conversation with a world of people. i learned a lot about different areas of work mostly the ins and outs of contracting and landscaping, as well as electrical plumbing flooring  mill-work and anything u can name in home improvement. my co workers were nice people who really knew there job pure professionals. the hardest part of the job is only during extremely busy days where there are three times more customers than u and they all need your help. the most enjoyable part is the things u learn the people you meet the employee appreciation party's and the success sharing bonus checks.

Everyday I learn new things where different products are and the projects customers are doing. Management and co-workers are great they are like family always trying to help each other in every way.

good,This company has a great team of people to work with that are supportive of one another and helps teach you anything you need or want to know. The benefits of a full time worker or even part time are amazing (you can opt out if you so choose.) Lunch is sometimes on the menu when you work there the staff support group is amazing and make working there fun. The training I received is above what I had expected and has given me tools that help me in my life as well as other work places that I will be applying for. The only reason I am looking for other employment is I need more money so that I can further my education and get the degrees I would like to have. I have enjoyed my time here at this company and wish there were more full time positions available but sadly there are not.
good,"Could be stable work. Clean environment, product knowledge, Enourages great customer service, can move up in positions, raises are not good, no employee discount.

good,"I worked all over the place at Home Depot. From being a cashier, to tool rental, to Garden, Paint and Service desk. I learned all about home improvement, which believe it or not, is very fun to learn! Management was friendly, but at my specific store, there was some favoritism. I'm starting to wonder if that's everywhere though. Co-workers were the best part of my job. I looked at everyone as if they were apart of my family. The hardest part of my job, or any kind of retail, you will get some nasty customers. But, the good customers definitely outweighed the bad, and I never let the nasty customers get to me! The most enjoyable part of my job was watching how happy some customers got when they made their final payment on their brand new kitchen! Sounds weird, I know, but it was definitely rewarding to witness!"

The easiest part of the day is when i get to joke with friends
good,"Everyday is a new learning experiance whether its threw the customer or from the stores computer learning classes. I have learned a lot about home improvement products from working at The Home Depot starting from learning the many uses of different tools in Hardware, to knowing what lumber to suggest for a customers project, and many more. My associates have the same Home Depot pride as well as other stores which makes working together an easy task. The hardest part of this job i would have to say is finding certain products for a customer in the store that is at a very low demand, but there are always millions of other products to choose from The Home Depot website. My most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customer walk out knowing that that I helped them find all the products that they needed."
good,Home Depot has great benefits and most of the co-workers are great to work with.

good,"My typical day at work would be managing kitchens, flooring, maill work, connecting between companies and customers for special orders, solving order and installation problems, while also training associates. I learned many different things. For example, while being a kitchen designer, I learned how to sell various cabinets for many companies that contain different features. I learned how to design kitchens and baths and learned how to give a precise estimation for the entire project including countertops, backsplash, hardware, appliances, sinks and faucets within the customer’s budget. In addition, I learned how to direct the customer to the products needed with diverse ideas. As an expeditor project coordinator, I learned how to manage a complete order and recommend products with the time frame given. I am responsible to represent the organization in a professional, courteous manner by establishing and maintaining a good working relationship with Home Depot’s high revenue customers. I work proactively to advise customers of impending service failures or issues. I am responsible for responding promptly to customer complaints/concerns and act in accordance with established departmental guidelines. I monitor the integrity of the order entry system and utilize the system for control of customer orders, reporting any problems directly to the terminals involved for further investigation. I advise customers of order and delivery statuses based on operations schedule and communicate this information proactively to the customers. The hardest part of my job is when I get from any company"
good,"Great place to work. Great supervisors, they were always there to help."
good,"Do what we are instucted by 1st phone, price changes, counts, validations. The hardest part is when our counts come up diffrent from dept. head counts. I love working with some of the best people on earth."

good,I like working for the home depot because it is a fast paste work that keeps you on your toes and the associates are friendly
good,operating fork-lift to organize work areas for various departments.
good,Loved working here and the manager of the store was great to work for. Wages were not the best at the time and I hated to leave but I had to go where there were greater wages. The downfall was that some if you called off due to a medical or family emergency then the entire staff knew about it and was talking about it.
good,Friendly associates and supervisors really care about you and even your family. Got involved in charity through work and that was rewarding. Scheduling was as flexible as they could allow. I really appreciate everything I learned while empoyed with this business.

Co-workers were always available to answer questions and together we carried a large breadth of knowledge. This camaraderie allowed for customers to feel comfortable and secure about the information they received. All this together made helping customers easier and positive experience for the both of us. Managers, were great as well. They helped us monitor sales goals and gave valuable critiques on how to improve sales techniques. Our sales goals were based off our weekly hours and was generally around $15,000 per week and also included opening 3 credit cards. These goals were not always easily reached but having them kept us motivated and constantly improving."
good,"There noting i didn't like about this job . It kept me busy and I got to help others. I work on front line , gave overrides and learn to cut keys . I had to count the money at the end of the night . I even learned to fix the self checkout. I was always on the go . I open the store and I closed the store .I even help when we would get bad storms . I would go help out. Everyone in the store was very helpful. The hardest part was we always had a big turn over on management that each one had their own way of doing thing . I love my over time I can rember there was one week I work 3 week with no day off and 3 of those day was day and night shift."

I have won Homer Awards, given recognition of my talent and i learned that working with others is very fun! My Co-workers all were one of a kind and that made my days much more grand, i honor working for home depot because i actually looked forward to going to work everyday. The mangers were very understandable and efficient. Anytime i needed assistance they were there to help me every step of the way. The hardest part about working with the company was helping customers at the Returns Desk, that was my position. I had customers who were regulars and customers who were not. But, i can say that i always found a way to help a customer, even if i couldn't return there merchandise at our store location. But, working in an warehouse environment you learn more about the products that are sold in the store, you learn to be productive and to have patience, and i am happy to say that i used to work for the company."

good,this is a good place to work with caring friendly co-workers and management. It does get boring and is the hardest part is when the store is slow and there is nothing to do but wait for a customer to come to your register.

The most enjoyable part of this job is the friends you make with the co-workers and customers.

A typical day started in the receiving department to plan how to stock whats at hand. The remaining time was spent streaming product to their home location. The hardest part about the job is that you have a four hour window for your team to complete the task. The most enjoyable part about the job was pulling together as a team. While working I was trained on how to operate material handling equipments: fork lift, cherry picker, and the reach truck."

good,Home Depot is culture and safety first. They help you succeed and rarely promote from outside. Again if you are looking to develop yourself the rdc is the way to go. Leaders and peers constantly push you to better yourself every day.

good,"GREAT ENVIRONMENT LOVE THE STAFF I WORK WITH ."
good,As a cashier I had to deal with most of the customers and it was a great job being able to be the last face your customers see on their way out. The only bad part about being a cashier in Home Depot would be that there are many men who will say inappropriate things and make you uncomfortable.

good,"Go into work and make sure everything in restocked, greet customers as they walk in.. I learned great customer service.. Manager was always fair with hours and complaints.. Hardest part was when customers would come in angry and want to blame you for everything.. The most enjoyable was when that same angry customer would leave happy and satisfied with my customer service.."
good,Every store is different. As far as retail goes Home Depot is a great company to work for. They advance from within for the most part so it is easy to move up if you are a good worker. Pay starts well above minimum wage too.
good,"Empresa socialmente responsable, con capacitacion constante y promocion de desarrollo"
good,"My shift would begin at 2pm since I was on 2nd shift and we clock in and do our daily announcements and goals for the day. Anybody would be allowed to speak managers , supervisors, employees and would share any stories or positive news they may share. Employees would shoutout any fellow coworkers if they helped them out the shift prior. The management was phenomenal. The most difficult part off the job was figuring out when you had a ghost item and trying to find it in the system. I enjoyed when Home Depot would have monthly parties for good work and would feed us food and raffle off prizes and free day pay off."
good,"The heart and culture of The Home Depot is one of the best I’ve worked with. They want to see their people succeed and grow. They know how to have fun, listen to their people and take their needs and ideas into consideration. I’d still be there if I hadn’t got sick. Great place to work."

good,"A standard day at Home Depot is actually pretty good. You simply come in get your apron on and get to work. Due to the fact that Home Depot has a wide variety of different departments I've been able to pick up a lot of basic skills and knowledge when it comes to home repair and home improvement. Most of the management there at the store are very honest and caring co-workers who always try their best to be on the same level with you and work with you when it comes to the everyday tasks that we have at the store. Luckily there are not a lot of hard days but I have to say that some of the hardest days are when the store gets hammered and we have minimal staff or a strange time consuming problem occurs, but the best days are when everything runs smoothly and you are able to do your job watch time go by in a flash and head home knowing you did a good job."

Check in with my team to find out their needs, and go through my daily lists which included Down stocking, cleaning, reporting on shrink mitigation, customer servicing."
good,"The interns are treated very well and they really want you to learn and grow professionally as a result of this internship. My only issues were with a person on my team who was meant to help, yet rarely had time to do so throughout the summer. This impacted my team's productivity but I do not blame that on the company , its an overall great place."
good,"Co-workersand managers are easy to get along with.  Hours are part time and limited.  They are different every day.  Would rather have a full"

good,"I love going to work. I know that I have coworkers who work just as hard as I do. We get things done and assist customers to the best of our abilities. Typical day for me is to go in and walk the department and decide what needs to get done to get the store ready for either opening or closing.

good,"Working at the Home Depot  Bulk Distribution center in Perris was a blast. Work is easy, management is friendly and forgiving, and working hard is enjoyable. As a General Warehouse Associate, I picked from stock, strapped down merchandise on pallets, tagged the pallets, and loaded them onto their corresponding trucks. The job can be high stress, when trying to meet your trailer closure times, but so long as you keep up on your work and ask for help when needed, you will succeed. My one gripe with my employment at the Home Depot is that it was temporary. I was working for three months doing a fantastic job according to my superiors, then I was let go abruptly by my operations manager (who didn’t like me very much for a few small mistakes I had made) . Although I was quite upset, I still regard that workplace as the best I’ve ever been in."

good,"I loved the almost 4 years I spent with this company! At the beginning I would spend countless hours of my days watching for unethical customers come through the door, then I would stop them before they left with my merchandise. Then corporate decided to change the game plan and took away our right to place hands on the shoplifter. Everything went horrible after that! They put us into a light gray shirt, and made us carry a cell phone which became more of a leash! My manager was a monster who would always belittle everything I would do. If I wanted to attempt to get into the job further, it would of helped to stop shrinkage further, even with the new policy of hands off, I was consistently told by her that I need to stick to my job duties and not go further than basically my pay scale! I had great ideas, and later found that she ran with them claiming them as her own! I miss working there everyday, but the stress this person placed on me was more than I could bare, nothing I would do would be good enough. I had fellow co workers who witnessed her belittling me in front of them.  Since I have left she has been unable to keep another Asset Protection specialist under her wing, I was one of the most successful ones she has had helping to bring down their shrink over 80,000 in less than a year.  The new employee's quit as quick as they start. So sad! Management would be wise to look at the amount of employees that start and quit under her. Then figure out if it is them or her! Overall, this company is one of the best around, and as far as the company itself is concerned, I would"

good,Working at the Home Depot was always a fun challenge. I was hired to build their Commercial Sales desk and I did a pretty good job adding hundreds of accounts. The only downfall was Home Depot's level of service where Commercial Customers was concerned was not up to my standards. I always treat my customers with respect. I never ignored a customer. My customer service is above what most people offer and I felt like my customers deserved better than what they received from some sales personnel.

Otherwise a fun company to work for and easy to get promoted up through the ranks."

I learned that not all people are patient and understanding to the process it takes for a worker to help them. I learned how to talk to people in a positive way to make the experience pleasurable, and have there needs met, so they leave in a better mood and happy. Management was great, if I had any questions they would take the time to explain it to me so I understood. I liked the culture they stood for.

It was very important for people to understand what they were looking for. Some people were installation professionals and needed little help, but most people were doubtful about what they were doing in the electrical aisles. At The Homedepot #3632 in Durham, NC there was a long time employee who helped me at the beginning of my time as an electrical associate. Hid name was Roland and he made working the electrical aisle a really fun time when he was there he and I worked at the same schedule.

The only lack is career advancement, but if you are passionate about taking the next step and willing to relocate for a better position I would highly recommend.  I've learned a lot about responsibility, time management and working collaboratively with other associates to get tasks done in a safe and timely manner.

My supervisor was very chill, the benefits were good and the pay was good. Got a raise after 6 months, it wasn't much but to me it didn't matter too much.

good,"The Home Depot is a great place to work! The intensity of the day fluctuates, but it is extremely organized. It's not likely that stress would be a problem even if excessive stress has personally been an issue in the past. Management actually cares about you as a person and as an employee. Most companies just view employees as a log in number that either can or can't work. The workplace culture is extremely family oriented. It's almost never boring and hostile customers rarely show up. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people that try to steal merchandise, nobody really likes to be put in that position. The most enjoyable part of the job are the happy customers.

good,"I miss Home Depot, It was my first job and it was perfect. Relaxed work environment, steady pace, easy work but rough at times.Not enough departments are full-time, all except two are part-time."
good,Homedepot can be a somewhat tough job but not so much that it overwhelms you. As long as you work at a consistent pace you will be done and going home
good,"I loved working for the home depot, very good place to work for. was started at $9 an hour for being a cashier and quickly was moved up to $10 an hour. very hard to get full time but as far as part-time jobs go, this is a good place to work."

good,"Management treats everyone, staff and customers like they truly matter and like we are a big family. The pay is pretty nice, but you have to request holidays, even the big ones off if you want to spend time with your family. They don't give you discounts for the store if you work there but there are perks and some discounts for other places. They also provide benefits and health insurance."
good,I would have like to be scheduled more often once I had changed departments overall my experience with Home Depot was great just the lack of hours when I became a Front end Cashier is when things started to like down for me a side from that I would love to be rehired at Home Depot

They don't just care about our well being at work, they go the extra mile to make sure we are taken care of.  We have parties to celebrate our accomplishments.  All and all, this is a very good company."
good,It OK if u need a good stable job but I'm on to more and better career. The company say it's like a big family. It is in some ways but in most ways people are just there for the paycheck I want to move on to find a career because being there I can't do it.

The Home Depot's culture of inclusiveness and of taking care of its employees, its customers and its shareholders has created a great environment to work in. Awards, rewards and acknowledgement are plentiful as are opportunities to advance if you are willing to apply yourself. Management listens and coaches and stays involved with the associates and the customers."

good,Awesome company with great chances to advance and grow! Great for working out and volunteering with veterans and supporting the elderly. Training classes.

good,"Working in the medical field for most of my life, the Home Depot job is just what I needed. I wish I had done this year's ago. I was especially impressed with how all of the associates, and management, learn and call everyone by name. And very helpful if need be."
good,"Pretty good. Nice people. Good management people training a bit wonky. Good work environment. Flexible hours.  if you meet goals, they will feed you. They also feed you on all holidays and all weekends with the holiday."

good,"Home Depot of Lemmon Ave, Dallas, TX was very polite and courteous to all of their associates. While I was there they were the most hospitable any corporation store brand could possibly be. Working there was such a pleasure, and I am sure they will be honest about my actions while there. The management was very nice, however somewhat too calm, and slow for other stores they do business with. The hardest part of my job was working nights, and the immense labor of stocking the freight packages. The most enjoyable part was mingling with the associates, and of course the actual rewards."
good,"The days working at Home Depot blew by; The job requires a lot of lifing, sorting, and putting away. Overall, there are a lot of chances to catch a breather and it is never too much work. Employees are helpful and kind."

good,"There is ALWAYS something to do at this fast passed customer service leader.  If you are not walking a customer through their complete project, then you are filling the shelves.  Great team work environment.  Workplace culture is amazing.  I started knowing NOTHING about home repair, and learned everything I needed to do my job as I went.  The hardest part of the job is when you are understaffed and it's a weekend.  You are only one person, and sometimes it gets stressful.  The stress is worth it if you keep a smile on your face, and work with the attitude that you are there to find a way to make customer's happy."
good,"Tengo 12 años laborando para la compañía , trabajando en diferentes plazas Tampico, Matamoros,Victoria y actual en Piedras Negras Coah"

good,"great place to work as a team in a driven sales environment ,"
good,my time working at the home depot was honestly amazing nothing to complain about. I would say that the hardest part about this job is saturday mornings and afternoons because around that time a lot of customers come in to buy their supplies for work like cement bags and what not but eventually you get used to it and its not as tiring.
good,Pretty chill place to work to be honest. I really enjoyed my time at The Home Depot the majority of the employees are pretty chill and the company does take care of their own.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for the company.  Its like I couldn't wait to come back and get to work.  It was hard work, but not stressful.  I learn about building and the best options for it.

good,Great people that will help you as you work. A lot of camaraderie among the employees and managers. everyone works together to help service the customer.
good,"It feels good to work because the work environment is safe with good management."
good,"My experience with Home Depot was that you get exactly what you put in.  If you work hard to do your job, they will work hard to accommodate you when you need it.  Although pay was a bit inconsistent across the board(as a supervisor I was paid less than new hired cashiers), on an individual basis they really try to compensate you appropriately based on job performance and advancement.  The benefits we incomparable.  If I didnt have the opportunity to be a stay at home mom and be with my new born son... I would never have left Home Depot."
good,"Arrive at store an hour before opening to ensure the store was prepped for opening business, assist customers as needed, use online system to receive online orders and pull/stage ordered merchandise for pickup, deliver orders as necessary."
good,"Every employee were easy to talk to and nice, the management was amazing, a good place to advance. Easier to learn, very professional, offered Benifits."
good,It was a nice place to work witn friendly people but the pay wasnt right for me and i had to move onto something different with better pay ane benefits with more hours

good,Working here is what gave me my forklift experience and helped branch out to better things in my life. I thank the homedepot I worked at with helping me embrace the community I was raised in and helping become the hard workingman I am today
good,"Some of the management teams wasn’t doing there job consistently. Or like, I think they could but overall “Home Depot” is a great company to work for."
good,"I started working at the Home Depot at the minimum age (18) as a summer job, and I am very lucky to have come across such a motivational place to work.  Although intimidating at first, due to the amount of training and knowledge you must go through in order to satisfy customers' expectations, coworkers and superiors are always there to help.  Once you have gotten the hang of the work and get to know your team, I was able to take pride in my work and the trust managers put into you every day which is shown in the relaxed atmosphere that doesn't make you feel like you're being scrutinized.  I was given the freedom to delegate what had to be done in my department and to interact with customers in a personalized manner, while still holding much respect for my managers.  The generally older requirement of employees establishes a more mature and professional work environment free of high school kids and unnecessary drama.  Compensation is fair and there are plenty of times to take breaks throughout the day.  As long as you show drive to do well and a positive work ethic, you will be recognized.  Conclusively, a fun and motivational place to work."
good,I enjoyed this job because I worked with the public. I enjoyed the flexibility of working in other departments. Manage and staff were great. the typical day at work was fast paced.
good,This job was one of my best experience in the work world.  The people I worked with were wonderful.  Customers were very creative and had fun task they were attempting.  Many were moving into new homes and we assist them in accomplishing their goals.
good,My typical day started off with meeting and greeting new customers. Cleaning isles and making sure that all was safe within the store. I enjoyed working and wish circumstances were different because I would still be working there. The hardest part was finding the time to complete my weekly computer training and enjoyed helping all the customers.
good,"they treat their employees well it is a great place to work if need a part time job during school or if you just need a part time job."
good,"Have you just ever gone to work and felt relaxed? I enjoyed going to work! I loved going to work, I looked forward to actually going to work seeing my co-workers and working answering phones, helping customers...."
good,"IT Hardware Deployment provides the opportunity to get involved and learn a lot about the overall IT structure of the company. There are many opportunities to contribute to the goals of  the company and IT Department. Home Depot is also active in the community, helping those who need it."
good,best people and the best business practices i have ever had the privilege of working with.  The staff on the floor is a huge loving family and the training you get there is bar none.
good,I loved working at Home Depot I learned to do projects to stock and clean shelves. The hardest part of the day to me was when I didn't understand and I could not get the right person to be patience enough to help me. My most enjoyable part of the day was everyday going to work.

I owe the Home Depot and District Manager Ronnie Oddo for finding my passion in Business and Operations Management> Hands down the best company ever!!!
good,Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. They have competitive pay and great benefits. It is an overall great environment to work for. The only improvement they need is how they do development. Some leaders struggle with providing honest feedback. That would be the only negative I would say.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot starts off as soon as you walk in through those doors. After clocking in I head to my department which would be the paint department, and help my fellow associates attend costumers. When it comes to attending costumers I try to make sure they have an amazing experience by attending to all their needs and answering any questions they might have. The fun part of the job is not only interacting with the costumers but mixing the paint for them as well. Costumer Service and keeping my department safe and clean are the main priority. If the department is clean and free of any debris then the workplace is much safer not only for the costumers but for the employees at work. At the end of a shift at Home Depot I head on home planning for the next day and how I can improve my costumer service even more to continue to provide great costumers service to costumers."
good,"They like good worker,safely is the first,I get good experience and people are so nice there.always trying to help they new employees ,I m very happy to have been one of them and I give big thanks for the company for what get there like group working.hope to get a chance to the same in my nest job ."

good,"The Home Depot was a very relaxed and fun place to work. Your job is to help people and with the extensive training you are provided, you are well prepared when you are put onto the floor.  I would definitely recommend applying there."
good,Of course whoever is running management dictates the work environment and there’s always a positive environment. You’re free to opt for 30 min or 1 hour lunch periods. Always room to grow and learn new investigative skills.
good,"Everything overall was a great experience. There were some days that were tougher than others. For example, being short staffed at times. Management was awesome, but sometimes when needing to bing up issues it took them a bit longer to resolve than it should have."
good,"Great pay, great team. You must be Willing to work hard.  If your lazy this is not the job for you. You have to be able to lift 75+lbs.  Fun hard working atmosphere."
good,Working at Home Depot was a very fun and interesting place. I learned a lot of new things while working there and how to handle new multiple situations that I've never been put in before. The only negative thing about the place is once I started school back up after summer they weren't very flexible with working around my school schedule which is the reason I had to quit from working there.
good,home depot was a great place to work the biggest issue was inconsistent management there was a hint of favoritism and  they did not accommodate the principles required to run a smooth as possible ship
good,"I've learned that working in retail is no picnic. There is no down time, or at least there shouldn't be, because there is always something that you could be doing. I've accumulated a good deal of knowledge about the products well sell in the hardware section.  I'm afraid of some of the mangers, but I think it's supposed to be that way, and I admire their industriousness.  I love the associates I work with--they're the best part of the job."
good,"It is a great place to work, opportunities are there for advancement and even a change of scenery, Management is ok but there is great teamwork there and everyone is willing to help you learn."

When you help people on a day to day basis, and they recognize you and use your name to your bosses, it makes for a lasting kind of feel good.

good,"I have totally enjoyed working here at this company. I wish that they would of done more for raises throughout the time I was employed there, I would of never left"
good,"There really is no typical day at work, the constants are pretty basic for retail. A review of the numbers/expectations of the day and an overview of the prior days numbers start each day. Aside from that the routine depends on department/time slot. You'll learn what you expect and if the management favors you you will be placed in classes to inch you towards a promotion. Which is nice, but also the worst part of the job, favoritism. It's blatantly obvious who the management favors and who they see as a good worker, the two are not mutually exclusive however. Become the store managers buddy and you are set to be an ASM in 3-5 years otherwise, good luck making him noticing you. Knowing someone in another store is a huge bonus."

The management team is phenomenal, they work with each employee if/when a situation comes up.

good,"I've worked here for about a year now and I love it, from the supervisors to operation managers up to the assistant general managers. You'll see them everyday working right next to you, helping you out, easy to talk to and even easier to work for. HR has great people, any problems you have they'll handle it and get back to you.

good,"The store I was at took great care of the employees and had numerous cookouts on particular days as a thank you for work on holidays and other special days. I learned cashiering and numerous things about gardening and tools, The management always took care of employees who had family issues, by raising funds through varied activities or time off for family issues. Home Depot is vary involved in Veteran issues."

I believe in treating a customer the way I would like to be treated. Being in the phone center meant  most of my customer contact was  not in person, but verbal. So that changes how you interact with them, emotions & feelings come through your voice so easily, I had to be very aware how I spoke. Smiling really does make a difference & it comes through in your tone. Management didn't see how I  helped our customers, but I knew & that's what mattered, so I didn't receive the customer related awards like the associates on the floor."
good,I enjoyed working at Home Depot. It was a very relaxed workplace and the workload was never heavy. If I wanted to move up in the company all I had to do was speak to a manager or somebody in my department.
good,Home Depot stresses putting the customers first and as long as you are able to communicate and hep the most difficult of customers you will do just fine.
good,Working at Home Depot on the freight team was difficult due to the schedule. Otherwise I enjoyed the benefits and the constant push from managers to exceed in your performance. I didn't like how the freight team manager hit on me multiple times but due to the lack of comfort i left.

The hardest part about my job was making sure customers who needed help loading got help on days we were overwhelmed with customers."

good,I like working with people & putting a smile on there face. I have learned to appreciate when compliments are given instead of negative things. Boss#1
good,This is a really positive place to work. everyone is really nice hear. I only got part time hours but it is a good place as far as fellow employees.  One thing to keep in mind thou is that this is a high theft place and the parking lot is not the best place to be at night. there has been a lot of care break ins that I have heard of. this store is right on the Indian reservation.
good,I have been with the company over 11 years and it is the best group of people to work with. From associates to management they all work together to provide the best customer service possible.

good,It is hard to give up working here! Love the people who I work with and the benefits even for part time. Days go by quick. Bonuses are a great extra!  I have been there for almost 19 years.
good,"No day was ever the same at The Home Depot.  When working in retail, customers will always change up your plans for the day and that is what made it fun.  I learned about inventory analysis, managing people, problem and conflict solving.  The stores in which I worked were like families.  The hardest part, aside from leaving, was working so many weekends and holidays.  As a grandparent, it made it hard to spend time with family.  Beyond that, I loved and still love THD!"

The atmosphere was either calm or hectic. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care of 3-4 customers at once. I seriously enjoyed my co-workers and there help when I needed it.
good,"Me encantó, desarrollé grandes habilidades para el manejo de personal y marketing social."

good,"I've worked a lot of retail in my adult life and by far this was my favorite job. I left to join the military but it didn't come through. The department management was awesome. We were always working and always busy. Great employee interaction, great customer service all around. I went from seasonal garden recovery to a full time garden associate and I loved both opportunities. At the very beginning I got my forklift license (expired) my order picker license (expired) also my reach truck license (expired). By far the best place to work!"
good,"At the Home Dept of Marina del Rey you meet a bunch of amazing people that are extremely helpful. There is always a manager on duty although sometimes they are a little difficult to get a hold of depending on the type of things they are currently dealing with at that point in time. The good thing is if you cant get a hold of them you can always ask another associate for help, they will more than likely know the answer."
good,"Even though work hours vary day to day, the job is still fun with plenty of benefits.I do enjoy working for this company however i would like to advance my career in a different field."
good,"I started out as a seasonal worker since I went back to college in the fall. Every time I came home they put me back on the schedule. They pay well and give you up to 39 hours a week as a part time. Since I am done with school soon, they have offered me a management position for when I return. Definite opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"A typical day at work is having customers all day to buy their personal needs."
good,"I like the Advancement opportunities available - they promote from within, I like my department head & upper management, I like the company policies & the training"
good,Work could be either busy or slow. You can end up working a lot of hours a week and be almost full time in a part time position. But overall a great place to work.
good,As the Vault associate my days started early and were busy from start to finish. I think the most enjoyable part of my job was starting early and finishing early as well as having my own office to work out of.
good,"The job was not too demanding. Typical sales job. In appliances you will go through training to become certified and also receive training for other departments such as bath and kitchen so you will be very well rounded by the time you leave. The management was easy to communicate with and understanding when it came to scheduling. Unlike most jobs I've had, Home Depot understands the importance of taking a break and it's usually easy to take one on time. The most difficult thing from this job must have been getting  pulled away from my areas of expertise and still being expected to assist customers anywhere in the store. That was only a problem if someone else was unavailable for that department, but that was often the case."
good,"Great company  "
good,"The Home Depot provides their employees with a respectful, diversified and customer service oriented environment to work in."
good,loved working with the coworkers. working environment is awesome. daily you are busy with giving customers help while doing your best to give the best customer service you can and fulfilling your assigned job overall is a great place to be employed at least at the Pocatello home depot
good,"This was one of the best jobs I ever had. It feels like the company actually cares about you. Even when the higher ups come in from the offices, they talk to you and ask how everything is going. They also have the homer fund set up to help coworkers who have fallen on hard times get the help they need"
good,I enjoyed working there. I was only there a short period. The job wasn't difficult. The people were cool. The management was nice. It was easy to get days off.

The Homedepots training program is extremely efficient, I learned a variety of plumbing techniques and machine training through the task on hand. I enjoyed the customer service portion of the job but I disliked the favoritism encountered through the Homer Award system.

good,"A typical day at Home Depot will include walking about seven to eight miles per day, and even though I worked in the electrical department I could expect to be asked as many questions about plumbing as electrical.  Fortunately I am well versed in all DIY home projects. I learned many things at Home Depot, but the primary lesson would be first understanding what the customer really wants, a lot of customers would not know enough to ask the right questions so you had to learn to pull the information out in order to be helpful.  I couldn't say enough about the Management, my father was very sick and from time to time I needed to be with him and the management always worked with me. The co-workers where very much like family I hated to leave. The hardest part of the job was helping customers who were easily angered, you just had to push through it and find a way to make them happy. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people, I just really like being helpful."

Management is focussed on the customer FIRST principles (Find the customer, Inquire about their project, Respect, Show the customer what they're looking for, and Thank the customer), and understands that with great customer service will come higher sales.  The hardest part of the job, like many retail positions, is long hours on your feet on concrete floors."
good,"I have worked part-time at The Home Depot for the past 5 months.  I have found the work culture to be very positive and it has been a fun place to work.  The management has been very encouraging and patient with me as I have learned about products, store layout, and store policies and safety procedures.  When they say that customer service is number 1, they mean it and strive to provide us with all the support and training we need to deliver."
good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. I used to think that you have to know a ton about paint, siding, wood and things of that nature to work here and you really don't. I was a cashier and while doing that I learned a lot about home improvement and contractors."

Unfortunately HR did not turn in my paperwork for my relocation back home so I ended up loosing the one job I loved .I truly was bleeding orange. Man how I miss this company. Go,orange and white.  I transferred  from new Orleans to Houston and was looking forward to going back to my home store in Gretna,La"
good,"This is an awesome place to work overall. Atmosphere is amazing at the SSC. My workday varied from day to day. Some days, calls were slow and others they seemed as if they would never stop.

I work in both departments 23 and 59, flooring and window treatments. Both of these require typical retail sales, such as having knowledge of all in stock products. Our staff is always expected to treat customers in a friendly and professional manner. I enjoy my departments specifically because of the sales aspect. We would make sales pitches on carpet, tile, laminate, and hardwood for customers who were interested in improving their homes or properties. The only cons to working for Home Depot is working late nights and weekend shifts."

The associates at the store I work with are like my family away from home, we treat each other with respect and when someone is hurt we all chip in to help them and their family get through the hard times by donating what we can, and offering support. The hardest part of my job is finding the time to be everywhere all at once to help my fellow associates and to help serve customers to maintain that customer first attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a smile on my fellow associates, knowing that what I have done today and everyday is to help make my workplace enjoyable and a productive workplace. Also to see the smile on a customers face after I have given them customer service plus one and to seal the deal with a friendly handshake, thanking them for shopping at my store."

I was put in a situation where a customer was being rude with me and I reacted in a way that i was proud of afterward and I feel that it was a chance for me to learn how to deal with people. The people I worked with there were good people and I don't remember a time where I felt negatively about any of them.

I like for  my coworkers to do their jobs and ask for help if needed. The hardest part of any job is to make mistakes and don't own up to them. I own up to mine.  The most enjoyable part of any job is doing the job correctly and in an effective time manner and being noticed for it.

good,"great company for anyone who is willing to work and who likes to help people with thier needs. store employees must be prepared to work with all kinds of people with all kinds of problems  and attitudes, good, bad , or indifferent. that is the crux of retail. The CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!!... EVEN WHEN THEY ARE WRONG!!!. H.D. pays well and an associate can go far with the right attitude and willingness to work. a cart attendant can end up department manager or store manager if he is willing to work hard and learn. When you have a great team working at the store, its a great place to work, however  bad management can make it a lousy place to work. most customers are great to work with and you'll find the most fun with them. attitude is everything. Most everyday you'll get the bear(BAD CUSTOMER) before he gets you, however one day the bear can get you, AND HOW YOU HANDLE THEM WILL DETERMINE IF YOU KEEP YOUR JOB!! Stay calm and cool and call your floor manager and hand off the bear. mis-handle the bear and even after 10 years of great service, you will find yourself promoted to customer."

It can be work but it is fulfilling in that you help customers get their project done right. The scheduling for the full timers is the bad but it is retail. "

In between helping out customers I along with my coworkers am responsible for taking the new freight that has just arrived and placing it on the shelves. I have learned that this is a big company with many associates and moving parts. In order for it to function smoothly we all have to work hard and do the best we can everyday.

The company gave me my first opportunity to get into the design field & I haven't looked back. I have been encouraged by corporate as well as management to pursue my goals to get certified through the National Kitchen & Bath Association. My management team welcomes ideas I may have to help our customers as well as fellow associates such helping with additional training for associates and hands on product classes for customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers see their dream kitchens come to fruition & having them come back weeks, months, even years after completion and telling me how much they love their kitchen & how many complements they get from friends and family. The hardest part about leaving my current position is leaving behind the regular customers and my fellow associates who have become like family to me."
good,"No issues with company and co-workers/management."
good,Great company to work for especially for those that need to work flexible hours. Customer service is number one priority. There is always a lot of work to do with not enough help/hours. Have a great rapport with my fellow coworkers and management. In order to move up you must speak up they will not try to promote if you are a hard worker. Pay sucks! you can get awards but it does not help all that much.

good,"A typical work day for me at Home Depot begins at 6am when I meet with my supervisor to get my assignments for the day.  I am then left to complete my tasks solo or with a group, depending on the project.  Projects range from shelf maintenance to full product resets.  Management and co-workers have a great working relationship and have fun at the same time.  We know when to buckle down to get a job done, but then can relax and joke around when the time is right. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the physical work necessary to complete resets since it requires moving and resetting steel racking.  And the most fun part of the job is interacting with co-workers and customers."

When you don't know an answer you can find help to get the answers you might need. The hardest part of the job some days is dealing with our vendors and installers and making sure they are on the same page as we are when it comes to providing the best customer service we can to each customer. I love when I can leave work knowing that I helped a customer pick out their favorite flooring for their home to make it more their own, when a customer leaves my desk with a smile on their face and tells me they will come back to me next time they need something at the store I know I have done my job and made that customer happy."
good,"The main thing you need to do is show up and do your work. A lot of call ins and lates will be held against you. If you try your best you will do well. Management (most of them) are very personable. Always be respectful but don't be too stiff. My co-workers are awesome, there will always be good ones and bad ones, but here most are good- atleast at my location. The job is not hard as long as you listen to instructions and follow the rules and regulations. The people you work with are the best part of the job. "

good,I had great work hours & co-workers were fun & easy to get along with. The management was fair at all times for getting time off for a family emergency. I learned to take special care & time with customers that had a hard time explaining how they were going about doing their project. The time spent with the customers was great & I learned different customs they had from their home countries. The hardest part was making friends with co-workers & they would leave for other stores.

I got to know my customers who had big projects and the store like the back of my hand. I learned more than just my department in order to help the customers better. Management was always there to help you when you needed it. If you ever had a problem, you knew that you could go to them in confidence that it would stay between you and the management team. My co-workers were fun and helpful, and we always found ways to work together. The hardest part of the job was learning all the product and departments, but even then it wasn't that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was how the store was like a family. Everyone worked together to get any job done, and if a team member was having a hard time we would always rise to the occasion. We had barbeques on holidays that we were open, and always had events that we participated in as a team."

good,"I have enjoy working here everyone depended on me managers, supervisors, and co-workers. I feel I was an asset to the company I was a hard worker, get the job done, multi-tasking, dependable and very reliable."
good,"The fast paced world of Home Depot may seem streamlined and well adjusted from the outside point of view. But the inside workings are chaotic and with need of process. I don't mean this as a negative statement. It's a lot like a family, always trying to do the right thing for each other, but mistakes happen along the way. The Home Depot retail business is just the surface of what the company really is. The real nuts and bolts of the company are the great people that work there. I truly miss the environment, the culture, and the great people that made going to work everyday so much fun."
good,"My day varied as in what time I came into work. When I was scheduled to come in on an opening shift we had to prepare our area for the day ahead of us and see that all things were ready for the customers. When I came in during mid morning, and mid day shifts I continued to assist the customers with finding and loading their merchandise as needed as well as keeping stock on hand. During closing shift I was to see to it that my area was clean and presentable for the next day. Management and fellow employees were very friendly and respectable and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of my job was loading mulch for eight hours a day when it was on sale. It was a pleasure helping and being of service to the customer and the company in whole."

good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the sense of being your own boss.
good,This company had taught me to work as a team with the sales floor and made me learn the importance of having to take the initiative to communicate with others on a day to day basses. In addition a learned what it meant to pay attention to detail when it came to parts that come in from receiving and the importance of knowing to read them properly to store them correctly in stockroom. Also I learned what it meant to meet deadlines and to do what ever it takes to get merchandise onto sales floor in a timely manner.
good,"I really enjoyed working at The Home Depot. My coworkers were great to work with,very understanding,and helpful. My supervisor was easy to get along with."
good,At the Home Depot you will come across a diverse group of individuals. Different people from around the area come to receive world class customer service at the Home Depot. It is a very interesting place to work because of the different things you learn each and every day. You will help hundreds of customers a day. You can impact somebody's day in a very positive way by providing these customers the best help they could ever receive. The most hardest part about the job would be having to go home and not make another person smile for that day. Overall this is a very exciting job full of opportunities and development. The work atmosphere is very pleasant and enjoyable.
good,"For being a very large company, Home Depot treated their associates, at all levels, very well.  Always concerned about their situations.  Willing to help with a lot of different options.

The head manager and supervisors' from highest level to lowest all exemplified fairness and a family-type environment. my co-workers were exceptional, teaching me tools in my department I could use there and in the future. In negative atmospheres, the hardest part of the job/paint department was being devoted to the customers every need and want. the most enjoyable part was learning new tools everyday."
good,"This job was a new experience and taught me a whole new side of retail. Typically at this job, I would come in late in the evening and stock freight that was received by the trucks that came in that day. The management as well as the co-workers at this job were very personable and enjoyable, I really enjoyed working for/with them. The hardest part of this job was getting all of the product out on the floor in a timely manner, but the environment was most enjoyable."

good,fast paced with many learning experiences. friendly coworkers and mostly pleasant customers.
good,Best job. Great employess and managers.only downfall is  the flex schedual
good,"No two days are alike within the dynamics of a Corp. Associate at Home Depot. A standard day includes, but not limited to, vendor meetings and new product launch. This is a self- sufficient job, with little over-head management due to the delegation of weekly/monthly task. The co-workers are all self starters which gives you multiple sources of motivation to draw from. There are no hard parts to this job, which makes the entire experience enjoyable."
good,"My typical day at home depot, was to get my job started. I love going to my job and everyone knew it. I would move pallets to different locations, of the warehouse. I would help others with their work. I kept my work area clean. I learn how to drive different folk lifts. I learn how to work as a team player. I learn, how to spot things that was wrong. I learn how to train, new associates that was coming in. The management was good too. My co-workers was always fun to work with. We always help each other out, no matter what. They brighten my day, while at work. Hardest part of my job, was that I had to train on a lift in the air. But, I face my fear and completed, my job. The enjoyable part was, I got to work everyday, and be around people who care about me and love me. We always made work fun and got the job done!!!"

good,I was a online chat customer service rep and quickly moved up to team lead over my department.
good,A typical day at  work involves checking in stock reports to see where we will work for the day. I have learned many things but the best thing I have learned is to operate the heavy machinery that is used throughout the store. Management is there to help develop employees and co workers are there to help on another. The hardest part of the job is having to get on the Order Picker that rises as high as the ceiling to get product from the overheads. The most enjoyable part of the job is operating the different machines around the store.
good,"A typical day at work would include the daily ""wave hello"" to my co-workers and a quick sit down in the break room before I would clock in so I could organize the tasks ahead of me for my shift. My managers were some of the best people I've ever worked with. Not very strict but they won't tolerate a slacker. Who would? The hardest part of the job I would say was standing for long periods of time near my register when the store was a bit slow. When all the counters and the floors are dusted and swept, there wasn't much to do after that. The thing that I enjoyed the most about the job was the people I would meet. Always meeting new people. Some, not so kind but you get that everywhere you go."
good,"Daily safety walks / catching shoplifters"

They want the workers to be in a comfortable environment and they want the workers to come to them with any problems. My co-workers work as a team and are wiling to help out anytime.

Advancement was very possible and attainable with dedication. Because of the company's guidelines and moral codes, working with others was mostly pleasurable. Nearly everyone kept a positive, helpful attitude. The managers helped guide us in areas we needed strengthened, they jumped in wherever they were needed, and they worked crazy long hours at times with nearly no complaint. The hardest part of the job was when we'd become extremely busy; at times, we were under-staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I could keep advancing in my current position or take on a different role: I had options towards a career."
good,This is a great company to be employed by. I'm just looking for  an career that will cover me more on the increase of benefits and income.

I wouldn't say that there was a hard part of this job, it was fun to learn the many functions and aspects of The Home Depot. The most enjoyable part of this job, I would have to say would be that there was never a dull moment. Many people from all walks of life with different problems or projects that needed help or answers."

good,Effectively load orders into customer vehicles and provide superior customer service ensuring repeat customers.Co-workers are a lot of help on the day to day bases its more like a family business. The hardest part of the day would be rush hour from 12pm -2pm its non stop work in the hot sun with no time for breaks.I enjoy working as a team with my co- workers to solve problems but the best part is sending customers home with a smile.
good,"Typical work day is repetative, but it manageable. I learned multiple facets such as major appliances and the pros and cons of each appliance. I learned product knowledge for general merchandise for example standy by generators, portable generators, marble/granite vanities, toilets, kitchen sinks and so on. The management started of rocky due to the rapid growth with the new call center. I did not find the job to be hard to overcome but it can be overwhelming to some. The most part I enjoy about working with the company is the benefits the company has to offer for their employees."
good,The Home depot call center that I worked at in Addison was a wonderful place to work.  Unfortunately the job didn't last as long as we would have liked it to because the call center in Addison was closed and 500 employees were laid off at the same time. It was an excellent place to work while we were there. The hardest part of the day was when it was a slow day. The management at Home depot was excellent and even hired an outside company to come in and help us with resumes so we could get other employment.
good,"Helping people find what they need to do the job right the first time."
good,"My location was a high volume/traffic store. Trained associates on stores'/departments' products. Coached and mentored them on giving excellent customer service. Because of customer volume and being home improvement, every day was different as far as solving complaints . Had to make sure merchandise were ordered and available for sale. Home depot has a culture of helping associates in distress through the Homer Fund. I was a regular contributor to the fund. My location also had a 'harvest table' where associates can take/leave food."
good,I enjoyed working there it was fun and people were nice. The management team were very helpful. My co workers were super sweet and helpful.

good,"HD is  a great place for those seeking part-time or temporary employment.  I started as temp/seasonal and moved on to perm.  However, I am currently seeking full-time and will more than likely not be fulfilling that at the HD.  The HD makes you feel like part of a family.  The hardest part of this job is standing for 6 to 8 hours per day.  I have great patience with irritable customers so this does not bother me as it does with some of my co-workers.  The best part is getting to know the customers that come in over and over.  It is very rewarding when a customer remembers you and the service you gave them and they seek you out."
good,"cash handling, and earned bonuses for providing great customer service."
good,"Excellent and Compassionate supervisors and company."
good,Home Depot has a goal to be the number one customer service company in America.  I feel that is why I excel in customer service skills and problem solving.
good,"On average the store is mainly crowded on weekends but if everyone is at their best then it isn't that bad but the management actually works on the floor as well so that one thing i really love about my job, everyone's involved. My co-workers are great people they always have my back especially when there is a bunch of customers in our department  and that can sometimes be the hardest part about my job especially if you don't know what to tell the customer about an issue they have but the most enjoyable part of my job is simply the environment because it can be very relaxed at times and the stock is so easy to manage with the store phones we use but I've learned how to cut wood properly, cut electrical wire, and make keys which is already easy if you follow instructions but basically there is know limit to what you can learn at the home depot."
good,"I spent 9 years of my career at The Home Depot Inc. progressively developing from an associate, to a department supervisor and to the Store Operations Assistant Manager in the New York Metro Area before voluntarily leaving to pursue my Master’s Degree. In my role as the Operations Assistant Store Manager, I helped the team drive and exceed sales targets of more than US $80 million, and profitability of more than US $2 million through managing operational efficiencies by taking responsibility for the P&L, encouraging and enforcing the organization’s Standard Operating Procedures with regards to safety compliance, shrink, inventory management, and markdown controls. I led my associates through the roll-out of the Customer F.I.R.S.T. initiative and use of the First Phone as tools that helped us to exceed and maintain a score of 9.0 on a scale of 10 in our Voice of the Customer Satisfaction Survey in the store as well as in the District. The Home Depot is an organization that has inspired in me an “orange-blooded” attitude together with its eight values that I hold with high regard and have motivated me to develop excellent leadership skills."
good,I learned as well as grew a lot with this company. You interact with a lot of different people on a daily basis. Working here was like working with family. Everyone welcomed me and didnt make me feel like that new person who just stood out. I instantly came in and started to grow with my fellow co workers as well as the customers.

I enjoyed my time here and I hope to find another job or career as wonderful as the opportunity I had at home depot.

good,"They liked for me to work in the garden section due to my plant knowledge and history at Clegg's Nursery. The sales associates would hand phone calls to me and direct customers to me for questions they couldn't answer themselves. I enjoyed the environment.

When I transferred stores, the second store that I was employed at, there was a great amount of theft. Every day I had to think, ""If I were trying to shop lift, how would I do so?"" and go from there. You ALWAYS have to check EVERYTHING. Inside boxes, inside PVC, under mulch bags, etc.. It wasn't easy. But at the end of they day, I could say that I did everything I could to make the customers happy and help keep our prices low.

During my employment here I have learned how to operate small reach trucks, forklifts, order picking machines and merchandising. I have also learned that appearance of materials in stores/bays is responsible to the customers, and also the stores to be able to sell items. The management is great any questions that are asked we work as a team to figure out the best solutions to an issue. Nobody looks at you different you could only been hired for a few months or a few years and you wont feel awkward asking questions or giving answers everyone is treated equally. The hardest part of my job is trying to set a bay to a planogram when the correct items or displays are not in the locations that they are noted. I dont shut down I do my best and inform my supervisor of issues I am having and continue trying to set bay to planogram with what I have.

The management team was competent and the members were always willing to help in what way they could if they were available. I enjoyed working with my fellow associates, as most were willing to help if I needed and the more experienced members had plenty of on-hand knowledge to guide me with anything I with which I was unfamiliar.

Everyone was nice to me, it was like a small family and the people I came into contact with, genuinely wanted to help and engage with customers. The hardest part of the job for me was probably adapting to the long hours. However that was easily done with the presence of the enjoyable staff. The pay was good and the hours were not too bad. It gave me a chance to continuously interact with pleasant customers as well as learn some tips about Customers should and should not be treated regardless of the situation. Very excellent in motivating their employees even when they are not doing their best. Lastly their training was very beneficial, they used examples which occur regularly in the workplace as opposed to a theoretical example of what might happen, resulting in their employees being prepared for difficult situations.

I am in the supervison dept, the hardest part of my job is seeing a customer leave unhappy."
good,"typical day at work would be assisting customer, assuring each and every customer is provided with the best customer service"
good,Being a loader was alright. Management may have had too high of expectations for a singular person to accomplish but that didn't mean work was impossible. the contractors i met were great people and greatly appreciated my help and they made my job worth going to every morning
good,"The job itself was not too demanding, but during busy hours, it was sometimes difficult to keep the parking lot clean while helping people load their vehicles. Often, people would be scheduled for breaks when it was busy which would create a much larger work load for the people not on break. As a lot associate, there is no direct supervisor, and honestly, not much is expected of you. Nonetheless, I always worked really hard and my co-workers certainly appreciated my hard work."
good,I would go in and help with customer support before working on all freight that had come in on that day. I was trained on all the heavy machinery so after we were done I would put everything up. Only downside was even though i would be scheduled 8-12. Some nights I would be done at 10 and other nights I would be done at 4 am depending on how much freight came in.

good,"Typical day at work would be coming in, discussing the assignments for the day such as how much much freight came in off the loading trucks, the vast majority of freight and which department we'll (the freight team) will be working for the night. To me, the most important things I've learned at Home Depot is the importance of time management, scheduling a heavy workload, working as a team and displaying great customer service. Would rate management at Home Depot as excellent due to exceptional characteristic traits such as integrity, self motivating, optimism and calmness. Also possess good organization skills, customer service, knowledge and and valuing other employees. The hardest part of my job is sometimes not being able to meet expectations of the supervisor due mostly to shortage of workers or limited time. The two most enjoyable parts of the job is (1) customer satisfaction and (2) being able to meet or exceed freight expectations."
good,"I liked the job because I mainly drove equipment, I done my job very well, several different jobs there."

good,"Before I left The Home Depot, I worked a regular monday through friday, 9am to 6pm work week. My position did not require myself to be there during the weekends. Throughout the day, it was my job to provide excellent customer service, explore and solve the needs of the customer, manage our accounts, prospect, and sell. I gained a ton of home inprovement knowledge as well as interaction with customers. Leadership skills was also a valueable trait i devoloped when I was selected to be a associate coach for the store when we hired new employees. Our co-workers was a very diverse crew which consist of different age groups and races. Associates had their certain clicks, but everyone got along for the most part. Very hard to leave the people I cared and loved. I excelled with pretty much everything I was required to do, but I would have to say the prospecting was difficult. And this was due to the fact that just about all of our customers were regulars. But I must say I really loved bonding with our managed accounts and building that personal relationship with them. I knew our managed accounts by personal name, and not just by their company name."
good,The management and staff were so kind and fun to work with. Everyone was willing to help with a smile on their face and I really enjoyed working with them over the holiday seasons.

good,"My experience at Home Depot was very positive. They were flexible with my schedule as I was attending school and my associates were easy to get along with. My days there were mainly spent ringing up customer merchandise and answering any questions that they might have about the store. My favorite part of the job was assisting customers with their questions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a few unreasonable customers. Overall, though, this is a great place to work."

good,"The reviews on this job vary based on the management team you have. But I have to say that I cannot complain about my managers let alone the department heads, Now there are times where miscommunications may cause stress and there is a small amount of micromanaging but we all have the same goal of getting stuff done. If you have issues make it known and they will literally sit you down and talk everything through I personally plan on growing with this company simply because I see the potential and listened to the experienced workers more over than the ones who simply complain and talk about how they are moving on. One major thing is don’t feel like you’re not getting recognized because deep down they see how well you’re doing. All in all my current location I give my management a 10/10 all day everyday."

good,My review was great and comfortable. The manager and I had a lot in common and it was great getting to know the team. Never enough help. Needs to hire more people for each department
good,I would train differently. There should be a computer at there orantation.  So the new hires could learn somethings before they go on the floor to work.  There should be a general map for employees to carry.  As some I worked with had no idea what customers wanted.  Better than using your own phone to look it up. But I would go back to work for them.

good,"I learned a lot while working at The Home Depot. They increased my knowledge in a lot of departments. The work load was always shared. My coworkers were like my friends, we always helped each other. Management was always ready to listen if you needed something or just had a suggestion. If I had any complaints to voice it would be about the advancement opportunities. Not many are given and you have to work very hard to be considered for them.

good,"When they’re having meetings. "
good,"I have no complainrs at Home Depot I was at. I really enjoyed working there. Enjoyed dealing/talking to the customers.. Great co-workers. Of course like any other company itcan get stressful at times.  The only thing I would say is the application is long. Remember the replication it took awhile to do. Overall, it was grest working there."
good,"Honestly a great company to work for. Work/life balance is good. Competitive pay for the area. They're very good at working with your schedule/needing days off. You do have to adhere to their culture. They're pretty strict about treating everyone with respect and like real humans, and if you don't, you won't make it. So if you're mean to fellow employees or complain all the time you may as well apply at Amazon or UPS instead, because you won't last long. If you're respectful and want to work somewhere where your fellow employees will be nice and help you/answer questions with a smile on their face, then this is the place for you. Only downside is that they're pretty unorganized, but you do get used to it."

The hardest part of the job is  the truck unloading and handle heavy and bulky items."
good,"As a Store Manager for 7 years and Assistant Store Manager for 5 years each day at the Home Depot was different. Starting and ending times changed depending on the job and what time of year it was. Home Depot liked to keep you a little off balance at all times knowing that the Industry was always changing and wanted there leadership to understand the importance of being flexible to that change. What did I learn at Home Depot over 14 years if I was to sum it up is that we are in a people business and you have to take care of your people. We had 100's of Leadership classes that we took and many of those classes I taught too up and coming managers. I learned that if you take care of your people they will take care of you. Our jobs as Leaders were to give others the same opportunity that someone had given to us. Within that as a Store Manager you had many,many metrics that had to be meet on a Weekly, Monthly,Quarterly and Yearly basis with Sales being the end Metric. We had many indicators and Reports that we could look at on a daily, weekly, monthly basis that would give us information that was needed to meet these metrics. Home Depot had a process for almost everything that we did as associates, dept heads, assistant store managers and store managers.  Any process was only as good as the people you had to follow those process and as a Leader those process were only as good as your follow up and motivation on the people that performed those daily process. The Workplace culture was one that our responsibility as Leaders was to give our people the tools to be successful in there"

If it a smooth day, everything will happen on time and no one will go over their 5th hour. It can easily be a day where you are stuck fixing a register, solving customer issues, managing money per cashier while also having managers consistently call you with updates, which occur regularly. It is a great position if you have an FES and ASM that is on your side and understand how busy you can be."

good,the people are very nice and teach you everything you will need to be successful. the work is not very hard and can be enjoyable. management is very nice and approachable if you have any problems or concerns about anything. the job can get more difficult when it gets busy but they always have an adequate amount of staff working so that the jobs are not impossible to get done. it is a very good company to join if you are a student or are new to the work force.
good,Home Depot was an enjoyable experience with many benifits. When I was awarded ‘Employee of the Month” it showed that Management appreciated hard work..
good,"A typical day usually busy"
good,The truth about working at Home Depot! we take care of our customers we are family as well as a team we work hard to make sure our customers are well taking care of! we make sure they find everything they need! U learn something new everyday plenty training classes available!
good,Home Depot was very relaxed and warm welcoming. It's not a stressful job you come to work do your job and go home. The job is easy work it's nothing you can't do at Home Depot.
good,"Work a 4 day work week, and got over time by working on your day off! Some times we would work over on our regular days! A lot of running products through the warehouse! They hand a small section of picking, most of the work was unloading trucks and receiving it into the warehouse! then moving it to the lanes for shipping to the stores!"
good,"Home depot se caracteriza por ser uno de los mejores empleadores del mundo y su ambiente de trabajo lo confirma. tienen muchas oportunidades de desarrollo y lo hacen con su personal a base de preparacion y guias de entrenamiento, dan, practican y enseñan el mejor servicio a cliente."
good,Home Depot has a great working environment with a large amount of opportunities to learn and expand. You can easily with effort put in climb the ladder to expand your reach in the company.
good,It's a great company that really test's your ability. Almost always willing to help you improve your skills and advance in the company. Most managers are friendly and helpful. Fast paced work and stress can get to some people. Only problem is that it feels like you don't get paid enough for the work after leaving the starting positions. You do so much work than what is required. You could not do the extra work but then you lose the chance to advance.
good,"Very fun and exciting to work Here You get to meet a lot of fun and great people here  you will  learn a lot while working here,   There’s lots of room for growth in the company And make your way up the  corporate ladder"
good,"A great place to work if you need somewhere to start, Also good for students and for retirees.  This place is very diverse and very interesting place to work."
good,"was a awesome place to work, i really miss it, really good group of people and they teach you a lot of interesting things that will help you with sales and teach you customer service skills."
good,"At Home Depot, you are given full rein to set your achievement goals."
good,I had a great time working overnight here. Always had plenty to keep us busy and had a really good team to work with. I would recommend working here to anyone who is interested.
good,Great place to work. Flexible with hours and other full-time jobs/school accommodations. Management is very respectful and supportive. Your co-workers feel like family.
good,Home Depot was a great place to work. The management is always very helpful and insightful. There’s always someone around you that is willing to help you get back on track or to help finish a long or difficult task.
good,"Its a job I'd recommend to anyone that likes physical work,its not a job where you could just sit there and do nothing,because there's always something to do,it keeps you active and it keeps you in motion"
good,"So I am part of the MET team which is merchandising. My first day was king of hectic I was put on the floor and I learned a lot so much that I did get over whelmed but according to the manager it wasn’t really suppose to go that way. Doing MET job on your first day can be hard I’m not gonna lie but when my second or third week flew by I was so confident in what I had to do I was told I was a fast learner. Being part of the MET team is the best job I can ever ask for. It’s not difficult at al and we averaged plenty of breaks since we work very early in the morning and get out early too. Everyone is kind, helpful, considerate and make things fun. No one is competing at all. I take my time doing my job then I come home early and if I can I even have time for a second job! I’m so glad I am part of Home Depot. The pay is fair and understandable why it’s like that since it’s a job anyone can do but there are many other job openings for anyone else to get paid even more. Not too worried about my pay because I am in school and studying for a higher paying career anyway."
good,It is a great place to work but it gave very little hours. The hours were inconsistent and they weren't allowed to give me more hours. Overall a great place just needs to be able to give employees more hours or a higher pay.
good,Definitely a good place to work on customer service skills. Helps you work with different people and know there need based on the way they express their feelings and way of talking to you.
good,Location I was at had GREAT management. Management encouraged promotion of employees. Only con is that it was hard to find full time postion. must be people person-company pushes customer service
good,Home Depot is a good company to work for. They will partner you with good trainers to make sure you know exactly how to do your job. The benefits are great. The social environment of the company is also very friendly and inviting.
good,Home Depot was a great job. Duties were never too stressful and busy days never seemed like work. Overall good experience while working at the Home Depot.
good,"A typical day at work FUN ."
good,Great company to work for with excellent values and benefits for all associates. The perks of working for the Home Depot are hard to find at most companies.
good,I am older and not looking for a long term career The Home Depot is great for me as a part time associate. For a young person willing to work hard and be reliable the skyies the limit for advancement. The key word is consistant hard work with the attitude I will be the best and hardest worker possible. You have to go above and beyond consistantly to stand out. Do this and you will be on the fast track for promotion.
good,I really developed my sales and customer services over my years with the Home Depot and didn’t advance into management as I really enjoyed selling to our HD customers.
good,The Home Depot is a fast past environment but also provides a fun way to pass the time. Everyday at work I have fun. I've learned a lot about products.
good,"I had a great working experience here, the whole crew and management were awesome people."
good,"Field questions and issues from customers, vendors, installers and specialty associates"

The management is great and works beside others there to help improve the experience of both guests and workers.

Family Matters tend to be valued more and they work with your life schedule, classes and Home Life, to make your work experience better."

good,"Great management,  associate are under paid, room for advancement,  flexibility with schedule, management is very understanding and is open to help out"
good,"I have many things to say about the home depot. But i'll keep it as short as I possibly can. My career path started as an overnight freight associate. From there I went to garden recovery from there I jumped into night supervisor. Then I went onto day supervisor which I enjoyed more than i did working at night. The difference from day to night was that you have a lot more to do and get more done than you do during the day of active hours. As home depot use to call it power hours. The orange life isn't for everybody though there are those that dont want to be a part of anything. They just want to come to work, do their job and go home. The socialization as well as the culture of the orange life is addicting at times. Its not only about helping out customers and suggesting other avenues of completing or amending projects. Its about connecting to that customer the same way we connect with our fellow associates to a certain degree. The hardest part of this job is trying to help everyone within a reasonable time frame as well as tasking through out the duration of your shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is looking at the smiles of people that you've helped and they keep coming back to hear your input on how they can proceed on something that they want to complete. Make a long story short, anybody can be promoted. Your career path or your occupational journey is laid out for you. All you have to do is reach out and grab what ever you can. Show and inspire others to do the same as you grow within the company."
good,It was a good place to work. Easy to work and my fellow coworkers were helpful and we worked well as a team and were able to stay focused on our task.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed and miss my job at Home Depot as an MEA in Portland, ME. I gave a two week notice, but had to leave 2 week time was up before, due to an illness in the family. I would go back to work for Home Depot in a heartbeat."
good,"Good Place to work"

good,My job at home depot was great! I started part time and needed full time though so I ended up leaving only after about a year. They even let me keep the job while I worked at my full time job it just became to much so I decided to leave. The staff and everybody there were amazing.
good,"Managers and co-workers are great! Couldn't ask for a better store manager! Home Depot allows dogs in the store and when I see one and get to pet it, it's literally the highlight of my day"
good,I really enjoyed working at Home Depot and would enjoy working their again.I worked as a cashier and enjoyed working the Garden department during the summer.I would work the lumber register and very much enjoyed the department because it was busy
good,the associates at store #3315 made the job very enjoyable and entertaining .........would highly recommend working with this group. management is supportive in training and stressing on the importance of customer service. A+
good,"Great place to work.  Make sure to invest in the 401k and stock options...Many employees don't take advantage of these things."
good,"Starting pay in various positions differ, job openings come by very often. Lots of leisure time if you play your cards right. Management is pretty all over the place, don't get on their bad side though."
good,I enjoy working here a lot and I'm not just saying that. Makes me want to come back to work almost every day.  Keeps me busy and is a good learning tool. I learn something new every single day whether small or big.
good,The managers and other associates are just like family caring for one another and sometimes even the little arguments like a brother and sister. The Christmas Party every year is the one thing I look forward to every year now.
good,"The company  makes it easy to be promoted from within. The training and coaching are amazing. "
good,It’s a great place to work if your in college or high school the people I worked with were really fun the whole environment was great and managers were very flexible with your schedule
good,"Home Depot is a very excellent place to work. Not only do they have great benefits but they make every day exciting and they always give you a drive and goal for your day. Management is strict on certain rules that reflect on the company. The goal for management is to follow the companies procedures and plans always. The hardest part of the job is hard to pinpoint because everything is very straightforward. The only con is the flexibility in hours and it being difficult to get on a set schedule if needed, usually required to work every weekend."
good,"excellent company, great work enviornment, great co-workers, great management, great culture, very enjoyable place to work, ytraining could be better though."
good,the home depot has a great environment to work with opportunities to develop and build up your career. the staff are well trained and are ready to keep you up to date on needed training and informed on vital information. it is a place to advance your skills and work your way up in the business.

good,Probably the most enjoyable job I have had!  Loved all of the employees and work environment.  We were a team!  Unfortunately I was not able to continue due to the health issues I had.  In addition I was having a hard time making ends meet due to pay levels.  Turnover was never ending due to pay levels!
good,"Had an excellent learning experience from a great company. They are performance based so be punctual, reliable and be willing to work in a fast paced environment. You need to want to work there. It’s not a bad place, just prove yourself so you can climb the ladder. Also, don’t call out more than 10 times. You get a 10 point leeway. Calling out counts as 1 occurance as well as being late. Anything after a certain time in the afternoon (say you leave early) is only half a point, so be careful."
good,Home Depot is a fast paced stressful job I would only work their part time or if I had no other choice management sucks and no one is never there to help some stores a different
good,the people there are just so friendly and willing to talk to you and to help out. they were like a family who were willing to stand by your side even though they had just met you
good,I really enjoyed my time here I however had to balance and toddler and 3 girls in tier teens at the time. Difficult to mange weekend inventories missed holidays with the family which is expected in retail and I stuck through inventories all hours
good,"un buen lugar de trabajo, donde, trabajaren equipo es indispensable  además de, que los jefes son muy buenos, y apoyan en todo"
good,I worked here part-time while raising my son. I always worked morning shifts due to my availability and they were understanding of that since they needed morning shift at that time.

Management is very much on top of their game. They care about their employees health, mental state, job performance, and just how you are doing in general. Home Depot made me feel like part of the family. They are also good about recognizing achievements with big boards to celebrate employee, or cashier of the month. They will post special notices in the weekly meeting sheets to recognize people for different accomplishments. They love to promote from within because they feel that the people who know their company the best are the people who work in their stores every day."

good,"Es una buena empresa que cuida de la estabilidad de los empleados y cuenta con desarrollo interno y estabilidad laboral, crecimiento continuo y aprendizaje constante"
good,Working overnight from 10 - 6 was good for me. It allowed me to work my regular full time job during the day. It was very fast paced at the beginning and end of shifts. There was about a 45 to 60 minute lull in the middle which allowed you to breathe a little.
good,"Come in before the store open so I could have time to unload trucks and stock the area with needed lumber, I worked with a team that take care of its own and liked to take on new tasks and challenges."
good,"Working 36 hrs in three days seems like a lot but it actually is completely worth it! Three days on, four days off made my home life so much better for my kids.

The hardest part of the job would be heavy lifting. However, it was made much easier with the safety regulations in place. Team lifts and specific equipment was often required and always available. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with my team, finding ways to handle large shipments quickly and efficiently."
good,"Fun everyone is very nice and helpful,if you don't know something  you can always ask,I work in customer service desk ,I plan on staying for a very long time."

good,"It's a fast-paced, always busy, very physical, and overall a friendly work enviornment. Management is very flexible with hours, which is great for those of us who go to school or have a second job. I honestly have no real complaint about this place. Management does keep a close eye on associates and departments, so as long as you get to work on time and complete your duties, it will be a relaxed work enviornment and there should be no problems. The hardest thing to deal with at this job will probably be rude customers, but like other retail jobs, there really is no escaping that."
good,"I like the many opportunities you have to advance. They CARE about their employees as a Corporation and franchisee. I'm currently looking forward to transferring to another area Home Depot (wish me luck!)."

good,It was a good job overall. The people I worked with were awesome. The only problem I had was the lack of career advancement. I tried several times to get full time but my manager wasn't able to give it to me.
good,"Every day is a new adventure. Customers are the priority, and their many needs will direct the Associate to many departments. With many options to choose from, the customer is not disappointed. Fast paced, there is always something to do! Downstocking, cleaning, product knowledge, freight, phone calls, and watering the plants in Garden. The work shift  flies by so fast. Lots of support  on the sales floor,with seasoned Associates, Management, and product Vendors."
good,Home Depot is a great place to work. They take excellent care of the customers and associate. They bonus every employee every 6 months. But the entire staff lunch on many occasions. Safety is key. Disaster pay to all associates. As for me I feel like I can be so much more but I don't have anyone trying to help advance my career. I do have a lot of potential.
good,"I loved working at the Home Depot. They offered vision and dental insurance for part timers, which is what attracted me to this company. I found this company to really care about their employees. They offer career advancement if so desired.

Working at Home Depot There is a lot of training and developing with learning other department where you can be able to upgrade yourself to becoming a manger or supervisor. Working at Home Depot Is all about taking care of the customers and associates and giving back to the associates and the community as well."
good,"Working here is pretty good, as a night owl I enjoyed being up and just logging away at a stack of boxes until the end of shift, I learned how to better organize overstock and handle task management better, tyhe workplace is safe and can be quite comforting when all you do is walk in and out of aisles with your carts. the hardest part of the joc for me was the initial sleep schedule reset, but after you get used to that it's a cinch. and the most enoyable part of the job was the ease of organizing the stock, just picking up tricks to make the stock go awa faster you really get a feel for the work and get into a groove."

good,"Son muchos jefes los que tienen una actitud predominante sobre los demás y eso hace que no sea del todo agradable el ambiente en esta empresa, lo que si es que todos deben enfocarse en sacar su trabajo día a día y brindar el mejor servicio posible con una sonrisa siempre en alto."
good,"I enjoyed working at The Home Depot. Benefits were offered even to part-time employees and the scheduling was flexible (i.e., I decided which days and times I was available to work).

good,I'm looking to just supplement my income in order to help ends meet. I love what Home Depot has to offer and I am 100% committed to the company. I'm looking for PT about 15-20 hrs a week.
good,"Great work environment, management new the plan and executed it daily, had daily meetings to see where all departments were and if they needed help, General manager was very knowledgeable and hands-on, had open door policy, monthly employee appreciation gatherings and luncheons. Had basketball court, fuss ball table, and ping pong table for employees during lunch and breaks. Decent pay for employees so they wouldn't have to work a lot of overtime to have a decent check, company policy believed too much OT altered work to home ratio."

good,"Great Company,401K,Profit Sharing,Feels like you are working with your Family. Overall a Awesome Place to work. They aren't about sacrificing their ethics for the sake of a sale, which I love. They also hire a diverse group of people and give a lot back to the community. They offer a lot of benefits and little treats for their employees. Although they push their associates to meet quota, they're realistic about what can and can't be accomplished."

Most of the management at my location were very friendly. The newest manager would bring us coffee on long days or nights. Co-workers become like family after awhile."
good,"I really enjoy the work more than I expected. I spent my life in public safety and the military so retail was a huge change for me. Home Depot is a good place to work and has a lot of employees that stay here for long periods of time. Its very busy all the time for me as there is always something to be done, even when you're not with a customer. It makes the day go by fast, I get a chance to help people, and I get a lot of exercise walking through the store and lifting the flooring materials in my department."

good,"The Order Fulfillment Associate position is not necessarily an entry-level position, however, if you can overcome the initial learning curve it is one of the more interesting in-store positions. You'll have to walk a lot as well as lift/push/pull heavy loads, so you're essentially paid to go to the gym. And once you feel comfortable with the basics of the job it becomes more fun because you'll get to work in all departments. Not only that but you'll get to problem solve in all departments which for the right intellect feels like game playing and/or puzzle solving."
good,"This is a really fun company to work for and I wish I still worked there sometimes. Working in the appliance dept. gave me so much knowledge. I had a wonderful mentor and I followed him to the flooring department where I learned so much more. I I would be confident in installing cabinets, garbage disposals. As well as proper tools for installing sinks, drop-in showers, carpet and flooring, in addition to being able to recognize and reasonably negotiate for and appliance, as well as mix paint and a number of other tasks that were beyond my department but non the less, was given the opportunity to learn"

No one in the store had a bad attitude. Learning new products could be tough but it was enjoyable being an asset to most of the store.

good,"Honestly, I loved working at home depot. I went to school full time and worked part time in the garden and it balanced out evenly. Management was understanding and respectful of my schoolwork. Home Depot is a very fun environment with outgoing associates. On the job, you HAVE to and MUST be careful of your surroundings for customers and most importantly yourself.  There's just a lot of machinery in use and in any department, you must be able to lift heavy objects, of course, only if you can. Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat. Also, you get an annual raise."

We should always treat each other with respect, and our customers deserve World Class Service. We never allow a customer  to feel their disappointment or if they had a problem, that it was not important to us, once they knew we were genuinely concerned it made it easier to resolve. Working for the  Home Depot was a Family experience, we took care of our own, we demonstrated our core values in every case and on every level. For me it was a way of life to clearly show a positive image to our customers of our company as well as working as a team. I loved our game room, we had ping pong tables, pool tables, and of course video games, very comfortable atmosphere to work we played physical games like basket ball and we also had BBQ get this with great Themes EX, Hawaii, football tailgate parties and ECT."
good,great work environment - management is pretty fair - excellent benefits many opportunities for free lunches pay is extremelyfair. good opportunities for advancement

good,"There is much to do from day to day and I have always said that every day is a learning day with this business. There is always new product and product ideas that give you the chance to learn something new. Management can at times have its ups and downs, but I believe this can be do to so much interactions between customers, vendors, employees and the retail world of so much product availability. There really isn't much to say is hard about this career, it's just nonstop activity and learning. The best part of this career is being able to work with so many people and help them with their projects and along the way it gives you a feeling of accomplishment along with vast knowledge."
good,"Working at Home Depot was great. the Management was very easy going and actually walked around the store and helped every department, they played a part in the lives of the customers and their employees. working in the paint department was great, it was always a happy day with happy customers excited for their fresh start. I would help the customer find the colour and paint brand/type they needed and mixed it up for them and made sure they were leaving with everything they needed to get the job done. unfortunately I had to leave because I moved to the other side of Edmonton and was unable to transfer due to lack of open positions."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in clocking in and putting on that orange apron and head to the registers. youd talk to the head person there and he/she would tell you who to relive so they could go on break and you as the worker take over. What i learned was to deal with A lot of cash and which tool were used for what. Workplace was good and clean. Hardest part would be either finding the SKU of the barcode or the customer when they'd insist on a discount when the item is not. The most enjoyable is the parties we throw, My co-workers, the management, and how they are very understanding for the most part."
good,"busy work day, "

So what I'm trying to say is, the more you learn, the better you get during time passes."

I learned a lot of the departments products and how they are used. My coworkers are great support and always there to help when needed. The hardest part of the job is probably the customers who may not be in a very joyful mood but patience's key. I enjoy the coworkers and the organization of Home Depot."
good,"Any time I need to make a home improvement type purchase, I shop Home Depot. Unfortunately I don't think the website is that great. Backward/forward navigation isn't the greatest. As a person who makes 90% of her purchases online, Home Depot is one of those vendors I would rather just go to their store."
good,"Mucho aprendizaje, nos evaluaba constantemente, con respecto a los jefes directos eran muy accesibles al dialogo. Lo que prendí: Trabajar en equipo, atención al cliente, manejo de flujo de efectivo,  arque de caja, entrega de valores, solución de conflictos generados por operación."
good,I was only working at home depot while putting myself through nursing school. I was a part time cashier. They worked with my school schedule. Plenty of opportunity to change departments and advance within the company. Very respectful management.
good,"In the DotCom side of the house, the people were great, the atmosphere was fun, and they really seemed to care about their employees. It was really a good experience and I would easily work their again if it were not for the slow speed of change. As someone who likes to be busy, this job was not for me.

good,"A typical day at work involves constantly being on the move. The hardest part of the job is having to depend on other coworkers in the department to do their part because the work in a day is passed on from shift to shift, so if the opener and midday workers don't do their share of work, the closer will be overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part of the job is that no two days are the same. Everyday is handled differently so you can never be bored. The workplace culture is very fun and family like. Everyone is always willing to lend a hand no matter what it is. Management is awesome. I always feel free to go and speak to any manager about any concerns I come across. I've learned that in any work environment, it always best to get familiar with departments and positions other than your own because it makes you a better and more flexible worker. Working for Home Depot you also get to learn how to do every day at home tasks, such as making a fence, painting a house, installing tiles, etc."
good,Worked as a team to analyze possible applicants for Home Depot establishment.  Provided information and asked appropriate questions to assess situations. My decision based on responses for particular questions.

good,I've been working with the company for 5 years. I started as a hardware associate and absolutely loved the work environment. Is fast paced. They keep you busy. You have to multi-task at times.
good,"Mi valoracion para la empresa es buena el problema en muchas ocasiones es la gente a la que se queda en manos de ella. Me agrada por k hay facilidad de poder obtener un puesto más pero el problema es que desafortunadamente se toman en cuenta a gente que les son mas en amistades o personas a las que se les da la preferencia obviamente por tener tal vez experiencia en cierto ramo pero que desconocen al 100% de las actividades que vienen a realizar y al hacer ellos eso no le dan la oportunidad a compañeros que tienen años y que por logica ya conocen mas el manejo de todo. "

good,"A typical day would be to take counts on inventory, ordering of product, keeping product on shelves, work area clean, sales goals, and customer service. I learned how to delegate jobs to employees and realize sometimes I can't do it all. For the most part the management was good. My manager was a great guy and a family that ended up moving back to Ohio. I had a pretty good group of people in my department. Mostly college kids though so turn over was high. The hardest part about the job was trying to accomplish everything without overtime. The enjoyable part was the customers."

Being polite, thanking the customer and great customer service are all great aspects to keep the customer satisfied and coming back. "

They also pay part of my tuition every semester! Can't beat that! I also have 401K and company stock that is amounting to quite a bit. 6 more credits then on to a new career, but I will always shop orange. :)"
good,Enjoyed what I did.  The interaction with the customers and branches I liked.  I disliked how the branches were not held accountable for the things they looked over as ultimately the customer suffered.
good,"This has been the best company i've worked for! The only thing that held it from all stars, discount. There is no employee discount!"

good,"The Home Depot is an amazing company to work for, everyone there is like a family, we all work together to ensure the customers leave happy with a shopping experience like no other. Management frequently recognizes associates for the hard work and dedication they put in. The hardest part of the job would definitely be getting more hours. With such a big company with so many associates not everyone would be able to get overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be getting to know new people and passing down your knowledge to customers ensuring they get all the information they need in order to be comfortable taking on projects themselves. Especially when they come back thanking you and showing you their success, its an exhilarating feeling."

Its a nice, friendly, easy going place to work.Co- workers are nice and everyone helps you out when they can. The most enjoyable part is helping out the customers when i'm not busy and driving the forklift to put product up.

good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy trying to balance work and school on a regular basis. I have learned patience and the value of the customer and the needs to we as employees must uphold by any means necessary to make sure that the customer has a great experience. My co workers are pretty reasonable and we do get along."

good,Adhering to your schedule is important. The people you work with are the friendliest. During CSR appreciation week there is a lot of fun activities taking place at the office.
good,great place to work with opportunities for advancement.  wages are low for some and are based more on previous experience rather than  how it actually apples to the job at hand.
good,My job was practically manage everything that surrounded me-- from employees to bank tellers. Fast-food industry is a growing industry where one must be fast. Mistake are almost not tolerated.
good,"The Home Depot is a GREAT place to work for. They really do value the employees, and the customers. They are relaxed, and there are a lot of great benefits when you work for them! The management actually cares about the employees, and understand the job requirements for most of the management started out as just an agent."

good,"siempre habia capacitacion, motivacion constante al asociado con actividaes dentro y fuera de la empresa con la familia, los lideres estaban capacitados para todo tipo de circunstancia que se presentara en el trabajo y conocian sus areas y capacitaban y apoyaban al asociado."
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday.  Everyone at the Moultrie store was really nice and sincere in all their endeavors.  We may not always have time for fun but we made what we did fun.  Since I like being productive as well there was always something to do and someone to help - that was a great part of my working experience here.  When they ask ""How you been?"" they really want to know.  Employees really care about their jobs, customers, and their fellow co-workers as well.  When there is an employee in need who may not qualify for the Homer fund, people still find ways to help that individual out.  I miss the people at this store dearly and hope that they continue to thrive with their hearts, heads, and hands in tact."
good,"Great 401k, and health insurance. They Take really good care of there people. They are there for you when ever you need them. Highly recommend they."

good,"Go into work, grab the returns for my department, put away, do pack down, help customers, learned a lot about new things, management was always there to help if you needed it, co-workers always there to help also, hardest part of job finding product customer can not find and it has 1 left, most enjoyable part of the job is when you help a customer with what they need and they leave happy."
good,great work environment. the supervisors really work with you when you need help. always a lot of fun. the workers are always available when a customer need them. the hardest part of the job is the standing for 9 hours on concrete. the most enjoyable moments of the job is when on holidays the store has a little party and even gets the customers involved.
good,"Meeting customers an seeing if they needed any help call or page the department that they needed, return items that they did not want an maintain cleanliness of the area. an take back any returns"
good,"You could work 10 hours a day, seven days a week!"

I love my job just want to get a little closer to home and do warehouse work, I enjoyed that work since I prevouisly have woked at this typed of work before. At the store we also have to help customers when a department head is on break and its very satisfactory to help out these customers."
good,"Working with the Home Depot has given me much needed work experience. Normally when I work, I will ride around on an electronic pallet jack and load up pallets and drop them at the corresponding dock door on my work assignment. My co-workers do not have much influence on my work due to the position. We are a team, but work as individuals. The hardest part is just keeping the pace for the entire 10 hours to reach my goal of 700 cartons for the night. The most enjoyable part is not having a supervisor constantly hovering behind my back. I get to work at my own pace but still see results."
good,I loved working here at the Greece Home Depot. The manager always keeps you up to date as of what is going on with the store & merchandise. The workers there are always helpful & will give you helpful tips/advice on how to improve work productivity.

good,"Outside of ""power hour,"" which is 10a-2p, where you do nothing but customer service, you are mostly doing returns, recovery and stocking.  I have learned a lot about fertilizing and insect management.  Management is pretty easy except during peak business easy.  My co-workers are helpful and easy to be around.  The hardest part of my job is pack-down while the most enjoyable part is stocking."
good,"The ideal place for me. Got a workout while on the clock. I worked a lot in lumber so I did a lot of heavy lifting. A lot of older coworkers that have a different way of doing things from the younger coworkers but it all works out. The management team is amazing. If you have a real emergency and need to leave early, they got you."

good,Working with other HRM's learning what you can do to help and ensure your employees have a voice within the company as  you are their advocate. There you will learn so much and understand how home improvement works and how to get the job started and finish. Management core vaule is understanding what it takes to get the job done and take care of your employees and customers within a time frame and balance out what needs to be accomplished day to day. Co-workers are there to balance and help with your work load as team to meet the requirements of the company's goals or set tasks. The hardest part of the job was to say good bye to fellow co-workers as you are getting promoted into upper management or moving to another store and the best part is meeting new employees and co-workers at the new location.
good,"Everyone is so nice, but you will have small ups & downs. Your coworkers are awesome people.You will learn something new everyday. Recommend it to anyone looking for a part time job."
good,Management is excellent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. I've learned a lot at the home depot. they train you on many tools and equipment and its exciting to learn
good,I absolutely loved working for this company. I love my team and the work ethic everyone had. there was great support from all managers even the district and general manager were very involved in all there stores and treated the members of management team as equals and family. I was going threw a nasty divorce which caused me to not be able to give my job the full attention that was required as department manger this resulted in my termination. however if it was not for that i believe I would still be with this company today.
good,"high paced"
good,"good place for a first time job, very willing to help anyone learn and grow with the company.  You learn how to give good customer service, and you can learn a great deal about many of the departments, this allows you to learn so much on so many different categories."
good,"I liked the idea of having my work schedule online.  However, often I would verify my next days schedule before bedtime to start at 2pm and learn after I got to work at 2 that they had changed my schedule to start at 5am after I had gone to bed the night before at 10pm."
good,I consider home depot the best job (so far) I ever had. At home home depot I had the opportunity to change the on hand to zero as well as finding a home for items that don't.

good,I loved my job and there were  often days where you met new and exciting people! Management was always a joy to be around. The benefits offered were amazing!
good,"A typical day at work i have learned on several occasions that people attitudes will cahnge because of diffrent situations, but i must keep a positive attitude with a very peaceful tone at all time. It can sometimes change up the atmosphere."
good,"MET offers a daily working experience unlike any other in the Home Depot.  When you work with MET you are guaranteed to work steady and reliable hours with the same small team of people every day, bringing each bay in the store up to corporate standards.  MET provides a unique service by working for the vendors who sell their products in the stores; you are bringing their products up to their standards in sync with the Home Depot's overarching standards.  I greatly enjoyed working with MET.  The hardest part of the job is carefully managing one's time, since all of your tasks are stringently timed in an effort to increase efficiency.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working on projects, especially those that involve tearing bays apart and rebuilding them as part of seasonal or promotional resets.  Look forward to Christmas Week and the Spring Resets.  Also look forward to having more paid holidays than your store-centric co-workers."
good,"I took on responsibilities that were not mine but that was my choice. I think in the end I was let go for a reason that was personal instead of job related. I worked very hard. I knew that whole store. Numbers were always up. I provided outstanding customer service. I had 17 awards to prove it. I did more work that I was responsible for. 6 Departments was a lot for someone that was only a Department Head for one. We were understaffed and I believe that is what you do , you look out for your store. "
good,"Management was great and always willing to help. The work load was very manageable, there was always something to do. And were able to help in other departments."
good,"Helping the customers with their projects is the best part, and being able to help them pick out colors is awesome. It's stressful when you're by yourself, but it gets easier with more experience."
good,Management and team members share the same philosophy of providing excellent customer service to customers. A great place to work for students.
good,"I like it they treat their employees, with decent benefits and other programs like success sharing and stock purchasing plans it is a good place to work."
good,First thing when on the floor is to walk your department make sure there are no safety hazards while Greating/Helping customers an co-workers also partnering with management to see what in there eyes needs to be done. I will say the hardest part of the job was the physical part there will be times were we needed to hand load heavy materials into trucks other than that i enjoyed helping as- well as learning from customers/Drive Fork Lift/Cleaning Duties/Pack -Out/Labeling Merchandise ect..
good,"This is the busiest store of all the Home Depots nation wide . I have learned to put the customer first , excellent customer service keeps them coming back . Management and co-workers are very fair and friendly .The hardest part of the job is pushing the home depot credit card . The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people ."
good,As part of the FFT a typical day would be to take the carts on the floor and stock the shelves with them. What I learned: To be optimistic about the work at hand. Sometimes it looks like a real hard day but in the end it flies by.
good,"a typical day at wok would be very busy even on a rainy day your always interacting with customers. I learned that the more you talk to customers the better value you can bring to the work place. management was excellent no complaints in that area. my co workers were very inspiring to me because they actually taught me how to and the what not to do at work. the hardest part about the job was lifting heavy bricks and grills and loading them on customer vehicles, but that was still enjoyable because customers appreciate a hard worker. the most enjoyable part about the job was the customers satisfaction."
good,Everyone helps each other out and is always happy and willing to help customers. Even though we are at work we have a great time with each other allowing for a better time during work.
good,Most enjoyable part of this job was the outgoing and happy co-workers great to have fun and help others as your passing time to knock out projects at hand....Standing back and looking at your accomplishments as a team was out standing and never will I forget the team work at store # 4421 in e sandy utah!  Miss you all !!!

good,"I found working at Kohl's' very rewarding. As with any retail company you must be a self starter, self motivated to get done what needs to be done."
good,company gives back to employees with incentives like snacks and pizza periodically. Its nice to see that when most companies do nothing. You still have a couple co-workers that could use a kick in the behind to get in gear.
good,A Typical work day consist of me helping out customers in every way possible. I learned how to drive a forklift. Management was very hands on and polite. Co-workers were very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to finding stuff. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was how nice all the employees were.
good,Customers were the only issue. Other than that management and coworkers were great. Time went by fast because you would always be helping customers or helping out a coworker.
good,"Typical day at work includes helping customers. Hardest part is getting to know entire store & products. Overall easy, laid back job."

good,"I am very pleased to be a home Depot employee, At first I was a bit skeptical about it, but all the employees were great and they made me feel right at home, including the management team. I have learned a lot in the 3 months that I've been there. I have to say that providing customer service is the best part of my job."
good,"On a typical day at Home Depot, the employee is expected to show up with a customer service ready attitude and undying work ethic. As part of the Home Depot team, one is responsible for providing for the needs of customers by having a strong product knowledge base, communicating product details and ideas effectively to consumers, keeping the aisles neat and easy to navigate, and being overall available and friendly."

Also, we would address concerns of customers and assist them with there home improvement needs.I learned quantitative and analytic skills from continually dealing with large amounts of numbers and product. My co-workers were great, including the regular Home Depot associates. The management was Okay, although sometimes hard to communicate with.  The hardest part of the job was ... hmmm. nothing. I loved the whole job."
good,I worked there for several years and meet great people both working there and returning customers. The company culture is woven into the fabric of the orange apron and I would honestly return to work there if need be.
good,The day was busy from the time you would enter work.  Every day had different experiences.  I have learned that if you take care of the customer they will be a loyal customer.  I enjoyed managing a large group of people to succeed in obtaining a final goal.  The co-workers that I worked with were both motivated and goal orientated.  The long days and long commute took up the greater part of my day.  I just enjoyed interacting with both the customers and fellow workers.
good,"Meet and greet customers and having good and funny conversations. Also helping out other team members who need help with either a product finding or explaining the policies of the company or resolving their issues towards the team members or the company, and sometimes being the only member of my section with good remarks from the store manager.

good,"Home Depot is a wonderful place to work, if you work hard, have a teamwork ethic.  The management is excellent in empowering the staff to make decisions that will make or break a sale.  Because of its right-to-work environment, you can go as far up the management ladder if you're willing to work hard.  They pay on the very high end of retail, because they're only looking for the best associates.  Management itself is empowered to do what they feel is best, so the decisions are pushed down to the lowest reasonable level it can be.  This is efficient management.  The job culture is great for two reasons:  First, management insists that you take care of your own problems (doctor visits, etc.) before coming to work on the floor.  Second, there is great cooperation among the workers themselves.  Third, Home Depot makes it a point to hire people of all races and nationalities and promote them as they see fit, and as a result, as an employee, you learn about many cultures just by being in the the lunchroom.  People are VERY helpful, and work together to complete sales, but you're expected to know your market sector.  Customer service is the most important aspect at Home Depot and they take great pride in it, and, for the most part, they get that kind of service from their employees."

good,"Home Depot is an excellent company to work for. There are several different areas to work in so you don't become stagnant - unless you want to. They don't frown on people who don't want to move up or around and they do help you advance if that is what you want. Customers can be a little rough around the edges. You have to remember that some are there because something broke and they are not happy about it! Some are there to update their homes and don't quite understand what an undertaking it is and they will want it all - yesterday! It's all worth it when you have a management staff that stands behind you and co-workers that become a second family. You will get to know some customers by name and they will become friends. It is very fast paced in the summer, you can't keep up so do your best. It is very slow in parts of the winter in my area and you need to find things to keep busy but trust me, there is never nothing to do! Overall, the hardest part of the job is the customers and the best part of the job is the customers. Home Depot does change often and you will need to be able to adapt, quickly! Don't worry if a change is for the worst, give it some time, they do realize it and correct the problem, so hang in there. If you like it, it will change. If you don't like it, it will change!"

A typical day at The Home Depot may begin with either a 'PRO' or a DIY'er customer asking for specific information on a product or in what aisle the product is in.

I learned home maintenance in a cold country was different from a tropical country. I got on quite well with my managers, but sometimes they leave and the new ones do not always understand so they say that you do not have the culture that they were looking for. My co-workers were all friendly, but when you have kids you do not have a lot of time to socialize. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that you meet every day."

good,"A typical day at included greeting each customer you saw and walking them through their transactions at either a register or self checkout machine. You also directed customers toward products in the store as well as make selections for them yourself or put them in touch with the correct person/department for assistance. Management at the home depot was excellent. Employees received immediate feedback about the type of job performance they were achieving and exactly what was expected. The managers are personally willing to work side by side with other employees and never hesitant to preform any task in the entire store.They also set up fun and meaningful incentives to help cashiers and other associates preform and help meet goals for the store. Co-workers are friendly and readily available for assistance for any associate or customer. The most difficult part of the job for a cashier is standing in the same spot on the concrete floor for hours at a time during your shift and not being able to part more than 8 feet from your register. However the best part of the job was the customers. Most all customers were provided with the home depot's excellent standards of customer service so by the time they reached the checkout point they were rarely hard to deal with and for the most part pleasant, making a cashier's job that much easier. At the Home depot they also make it a point to give back to community in which the store is present allowing associates the opportunity to pitch in really inspires workers to see the big picture."

good,Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. My managers were fantastic until my most current manager changed positions and I was assigned another manager who was not the same. Because of this new management that took place it was in my best interest to leave. The new manager was not as understanding to the procedures that were taking place and having to deal with a new manager when you already know what to do was very annoying. They wanted to change everything when they joined the team when there was no need because what we were doing was working great for the team. Later I found that I was not the only to leave because of the new manager that came on the team. overall though home depot is great.

good,It was a good review and I also love the people at HOMEDEPOT. It was a good learning experience for my future. I learned so much on working together with other associates.
good,"A retail experience without much customer interaction. Daily short meetings are held at the start of shift mostly consisting of assignments, guided stretching exercises, and a strong focus on reoccurring training. Nights are spent with little interaction with other employees as you complete your own assignment. However break room is well maintained and a social gathering hub comfortable well appointed furniture and entertainment is provided. Growth within the company is highly encouraged, but as a lower level employee the path is not always illuminated on how to proceed. The work does include a lot of manual labor moving varying sized objects to dizzying heights."

good,"The minute I clocked in, I went right into work, I had many postilions at this job, but mainly making sure the customer was taken care of and their questions answered correctly and thoroughly. Than I would make sure the product was stocked and the bays were priced and labeled correctly, so make sure customers can see what we are selling and how much it was.

good,"It was very fun place to work at but the pay even for managers and store managers is very low they brag at how much they make I think to myself that's not the area norm. I was a licensed painting contractor and was painting for 30 years and started at minimum wage. Also when you take there product knowledge test they contradict the trade and what the California State License Board test say . Like if you took the license test and passed but they ask a similar question like an application process and you answered the way you were trained and answer the way you did on CSLB test they will say it's wrong. They are not a contractor there business is not to perform electrical, plumbing, roofing or Painting. They are a hardware store that hires professionals and tells them how to sell a product not even to the manufacturer standards. They start everyone at minimum wage. No matter your experience or knowledge. The cost of living wage will take forever but it is security they do have they will always be there and it's year round work . I liked the environment and the dept I worked in I gave advice according to the method of the painting contractor of America which is the standard all painters go by. Advancement takes forever."

Another problem I had was almost every department had a bad apple who is lazy or really doesn't know anything about the tools/items.

The only complaint I have is the fact that not everyone is able to get all customers to open Credit accounts.  I felt that your advancement was based on the amount of accounts opened.

good,"This was my 1st job, I was in High School 🏫. I’ve had a few jobs since then and this one was by far the best. Mangers were great, staff was great, hours were great, & the pay was great !!

good,"Home Depot is a great company to work for. Great benefits in health, eye, dental. You get a bonus every 6 months and a raise every year, and starting pay is over minimum wage. And the management team and my co-workers are fantastic!"
good,Is a fast paste job and extremely stressfull especially when we were backed up on work and we had to get everything done at a certain time frame i would be overwhelmed.
good,Great company to work for. They treat employees very well and do everything that they can to help you succeed. The benefits are great and they offered full benefits from the first day.

good,"After a pretty nasty time at Walmart and other chain stores, I just assumed all minimum wage jobs were the same. Home Depot showed me otherwise. Management was pleasant and complimentary when work is met to a satisfactory level and they never once made any requests outside of the job description or to keep exceeding goals like other companies do(they understand this is a downward spiral to burnout and poor performance). The only thing that really detracted from what could be provided in terms of customer service and overall growth for the company would be the very excessive pushing of credit card applications to customers. It's generally considered annoying and makes workflow very awkward(on-screen prompts on the register for EVERY transaction)."
good,"Very busy work environment. Always something to get done.  I worked as an Independent Contractor and I was treated very well, the install manager always made sure I had what I needed to complete every job assigned to me."

good,the supervisors are terrible. they constantly threatened to fire us and would compare us to other employees. they were extremely immature and some of the male supervisors harassed some of the younger female employees. the job itself is super easy for the pay and you could work your way up.

good,"Working at The Home Depot has been overall an enjoyable experience. I'm happy to have been working for a company that consists of generally friendly people, everybody there respects me as much as I respect them. I became friends with some of the people I work with, and sometimes I even spent time with them after work. The customers there are overall friendly too, very rarely do I get a customer who will snap at me. I always do my best to help the customers as much as I can, and if I'm unable to help them, I escort them to an associate who can. For my job, I'm required to organize the shopping carts so that the parking lot is clear, and customers know where to receive them. I also am responsible for taking out the trash around closing time, or when the cans just get full. What I like best about my job is that I'm required to walk around outside, and lift items in and out of customers' vehicles, meaning that not only am I working a well-paying job, but I'm also getting a good workout. The hardest part of my job, however, is having to work in weather conditions that can be seen as unbearable. Overall, I'd definitely recommend anybody who is looking for a job to apply to The Home Depot. Even people who had no experience before, like me, can get a job there. The Home Depot is a great company that allows people to start from the bottom, and work their way up."

I have learned to develop my communication skills and selling skills while working here for 17 years. Management is very determined to be the best and it overflows into the employees. The culture is great here. There are many opportunities to grow within the company. The hardest part of the job is competing with local vendors who do not offer the quality of product that we do and trying to educate the client what they are spending their money on and why there can be such great differences in pricing. The most enjoyable part of the job is taking an old, tired kitchen and transforming it into the most beautiful part of the home.

The job was pretty easy going, the hardest part is unloading the semi trailers, but after that it is smooth sailing, you just stock the product accordingly in the aisles, you can even listen to music since it is after hours and there are no customers around."

good,"The position that I worked in (gap fill, in shipping) involved more walking than any other job I've ever had. Not just because it was part of the job, but because the building is almost a mile long and my position was located near the back and involved walking up and down the many outbound doors looking for carts filled with packages to load into the gaps between pallet loaded stuff. It was the hardest part of the job and the only real complaint I have about the place.

Driving the forklift and other machinery is enjoyable and every co worker knows each other and has each others back like one big family. Management was strict but in a good way, no goofing around but plenty of laughs and smiles. The hardest part for me would be the harsh temperatures working outside throwing bags of dirt sand and concrete into customer after customers vehicles in the sun during the Texas summers of 90+ heat.

Our store was located in very close proximity to apartments, so we were not allowed to have trucks parked overnight. We would unload immediately and store the merchandise in the aisles while we waited for the store to close. Once it did, we would go to our assigned areas and put away our stock. If we had the time or on days when the truck was light or there was no truck at all, we would move stock from the upper shelves to the displays. Since there were no customers, we could work freely, play our own music, and wear pretty much anything we liked. It was a very easy job and I only wish it would have paid a little more or offered full-time hours in my area."

Strategic planning can be the overarching management concept that sets the direction the “ship of business” will take.

Internal and external strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and even threats are all factored into the planning process and procedures.

Management has always been positive, stepped in to help when they see it necessary, and always open to talk. A typical day as a cashier is you clock in, help ring up customers purchases, make sure their experience was exceptional, and ask that they fill out a quick survey to help our marketing program and the customer a chance to win some money. Two hours into your shift you take a break. If your shift is 5-8 hours long, then you get a 30min lunch 4 hours into your shift and a second break a few hours later. The hardest part, is trying to keep a cool head when dealing with cranky construction workers. Otherwise all the people that work there are absolutely amazing!"
