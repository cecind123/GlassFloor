bad,"UNPROFESSIONAL, revolving door, constant lay offs and worries about job secruity"
bad,A typical day at work was good until I had A supervisor tell on me non-stop. She was upset with me because I had to switch shifts. I did enjoy the students that were attending the trade school. I did make a couple of new friends a long the was which was great. I would like to go back to that job someday. The co-workers that were rude to me have quit.
bad,The company has a good product.  Corporate management need to be replaced with people who understand the schools.  Very fast paced and over worked. There is never time for lunch breaks. Work 12 hour days everyday except Saturday and Sunday.  No help.
bad,"Education Management LLC.  is a poor copy of what the ""leaders"" believe a school should be . The president all but pilfered the manual from AIU and is defrauding the community and its students. Either fall in line or get left behind is the motto used here."
bad,"The only enjoyable part of the job was interacting with and contributing to students. However, the commitment of faculty members, in spite of being so poorly managed, was impressive."
bad,"Working as a teacher is very interesting but stressful. I feel happy when I teach people to speak a foreign language, a language of technology. stress"
bad,"Management is unprofessional at best.  No rhyme or reason to any decisions on any level of management.  Very unorganized.  Constantly moving your desk from one section of the office to another at upper managements whim.  Worked there six years move my desk eight times.  Employees are not valued as actual living, breathing beings.  Expected to reach unattainable goals in an unrealistic amount of time.  Always the threat of a layoff.  Company has been repeatedly sued for improper business practices.  Company debt was bought after being sued for over 95 million dollars.  Pay is relatively decent, and the benefits are so-so.  Bottom line if you have any self respect, decency or sanity you will not send your resume to this company."
bad,There is no place else to work within the university.  I took the time to earn a degree and have not been able to use it.
bad,"Management is ruthless in making sure they look competent to the disadvantage of instructors, students are seen as a fee payer."
bad,"They were not honest with us. It was very stressful, no advancement. You never got raises unless you were promoted. Work life balance was not always there."
bad,"Valuable training and volunteer opportunities."
bad,Rough place to work.  I was there a year and my understanding is that the site went through another half dozen DAs in the next 5 years.
bad,It is nice to help individuals obtain their educational goals but the office atmosphere is terrible.
good,there was limited advancement opportunities and that is why I needed to make a change.
good,Due to economic and political conditions I was laid off from Education Management in September. It was a great place to work. I have developed life long friendships and am grateful for the experience.
good,Really enjoy helping prospective students reach their educational goals.  Love just being honest with them and treating them the way I want to be treated.  Love keeping it real with my team and not sugar coating how tough of an industry and job they have.  The company needs to listen to it's top employees of how to improve the culture.  Too many employees that are doing the right things are leaving because things keep getting taken away and never anything to benefit the employee to enjoy working here.
good,"This is a great place to work but don't plan to stay there for more than 2-3 years. Get in, get the experience and get out. The Pros definitely outweigh the Cons but it is not a place where you develop."
good,"I worked at The Art Institute of Pittsburgh Online Division for almost 8 years. I truly enjoyed the people and learned alot about myself. I made it my personal mission to learn as much as I possibly could so I made sure that I took the best possible care of my students. Since we did have quotas, sometimes the work life balance was not as even as it should of been. Over all I truly enjoyed working there."
good,"I learned a great deal in my years at EDMC, including technical training in Microsoft Office, and how to coordinate with numerous teams to provide an excellent student experience. Effective communication was one of the biggest issues, however, and many problems I and others experienced can be traced back to that."
good,"Education Management needs competent, qualify, and committed individuals to hold the position within the organization.  Their information should be in one central database for authorized people to have access with ease."
good,I worked there for 8 years and believe in what they stand for.  There were a lot of good people there that cared about the students.  There were always a couple of people that were more interested in themselves than always doing the right thing.
good,"Their is a difficulty within this company that causes little advancement as well as oversights. The company is currently going through a large transition and doesn't provide strong job-security. I did learn a great deal from this company to allow me to advance myself as an individual but there is improvement needed. Co-workers as well as management are quite kind, however there can be a lot of miscommunication which causes lower tier employees to not understand their roles. The most enjoyable part of this job is the clientele; hearing that you have done a great job, seeing a student place their trust in your hands and it all working out for the better was always rewarding."
good,Very busy working enviroment. Nice Office location. Team work well together and very friendly office. Managers understanding. laid back enviroment within the company. relaxed dress code.
good,EDMC is a high paced company with a lot of change.  The industry is highly regulated and there is a lot of pressure to perform.  The most difficult part of the job was motivating a staff who feels beaten down and unappreciated at times.  I learned a lot there and I know am I a better leader for my time spent there.
good,People are the strength o any organization. EDMC as the parent company has been under heavy scrutiny for many years and therefore processes change daily.
good,"Great place to learn your trade. It has a large environment to learn in.  If you want to learn industry standards, this is the place. I would highly recommend this company"
good,"Ensure compliance with all corporate policies and ethical standards as well as all federal and state requirements"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working with a group of people who set out everyday to make sure that the work is done correctly and timely.  We do everything by the book.  So much so that I actually look forward to be audited.  Nothing better than when an auditor comes in and can't find anything wrong.
good,"Right in Downtown Pittsburgh, good team atmosphere, competitive salary"
good,EDMC has been going  through a transformation period from a for profit education to a nonprofit education system.  There have been quarterly layoffs as the enrollment declines.
good,"EDMC was a decent place to work, EDMC had decent benefits. In my position as High School Representative, it afforded good work life balance"

good,"-- Typical day at work would include working off a spreadsheet to review completed files packaged by the packaging department. "
good,"Great"
good,"It was a very challenging and rewarding position.  While I represented the local Art Institute, I took the approach that I was running my own business.  I would devise a strategic plan in the morning of each day on who, when and how to reach out to prospective students.  Building a pipeline of business was a must in that role as not everyone was in a position to start classes that week.  We had class sessions opening every 2-3 weeks.  I was able to close students on one call as well as sometimes had to set follow up appointments to further present the school.  Often that meant presenting to a student's family and friends (support group)."
good,"I have developed professionally at Education Management, the CEO is known for growth development. I have learned a lot about campus operations."
good,This was a good place to work. Management and coworkers are friendly and knowledgeable. I would work for them again in the future.

My work was very satisfying in that I was able to -in the span of an hour or two- help students who were having difficulty in their classes better understand their assignments."

good,"Interesting industry to work for, focusing on niche market, and top producing clients. lots to learn from. all operation and support takes place in UK."
good,Great opportunity in the education sector. has many great people to work for and work life balance is great. Government crackdowns and the demographic we cater to causes a lot of anxiety
good,"No complaints, fun culture, good people to work with. Job security is not so good, since this company is definitely going through some rough times. But all in all, the culture is what really stands out."
good,This was a great experience and I learned a lot at this company. Fast paced and forced workers to learn to work very quickly but also efficiently.
good,A lot of fun.  Got to help a lot of people find their niche in life.
good,"My experience at AIA was most valuable because of several factors. Having previous experience at a public institution [CSU], the proprietary nature of a private institution offered new perspectives, responsibilities, and opportunities. Most valuable was the opportunity to be part of such a diverse creative community. The range of artistic interest and expertise was most unique and inspirational. Teaching students from multiple majors afforded me the opportunity to learn about their fields of endeavor. The challenge of teaching artistic populations was their relatively weak academic skills and linear cognitive abilities. I was also able develop an appreciation for the contrast in business models and management between public & proprietary schools. The opportunity to serve on three State postsecondary accreditation committees evaluating proprietary schools as a General Education consultant was also most valuable."
good,"Industry a bit unstable, but AI is an amazing place. The managers are loyal and truly amazing. And the programs are amazing as well"
good,Daily schedule is busy and flexibility and the ability to solve different problems is a must. My department is filled with great people to work with. Overall staff are appreciative of different department roles.
good,"The position required less accounting skills and for more attention to detail. Company operated job corp. centers on behalf of the Dept. of Labor. The position required that one follow the directions detailed by the DOL in their guidelines. "
good,"Three call centers, I was responsible for all the network in the Phoenix area, co-workers were pleasant to work with.  On call was the hardest part as I was paged even if the issue was a switch, router or software problem as a general page went out to all on call personnel.  I  was able to work from home a few days a week.  I was only eight minutes from my office and 15 minutes from the other two call centers."
good,"Typical workday was to answer and transfer calls, receive and sort mail, filing, and enter payable s into Quick Book. The management team was very professional and organized"
good,"Basically its a field work, we had nearly 28 branches of our institutions around 180kms from vizag. In our company we had only 3 service engineers, We 3 service engineers have to work for 28 client places."
good,Really enjoyed my position in Online customer service. Very flexible  office and home position. Job security was not very good however. Department got completely eliminated. Wish that didn't happen because the pay was good.

good,Great company as far as the people.  Upper management tends to keep subordinates in the dark way too much about the well being of the company.
good,"I enjoyed the daily interaction with people and having the ability to help them make positive life changes. Great benefits with this company and I was hoping to be there till retirement, unfortunately that was not an option after closing their doors. I loved my daily routine and all my co- workers, positive work environment. Meting monthly sales number was the hardest part of job, and bringing in outside referrals. The best part was seeing students overcome life obstacles and graduating with their degrees."

good,I've valued my experience at my current company.  I've learned to structure my days and month on firm and loose deadlines.  I've learned to be analytical.  I've learned how to work within groups and independently.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the environment which is diverse and intelligent where all opinions are respected.  The most difficult aspect of my position is working for a company that is going through constant transition to due factors outside of their control which effects the employees lives and morale over time.
good,I enjoyed working at Education Management Corporation.  The job was great because it allowed me to interact with students trying to plan their future careers.  My co-workers were possibly the best part of the job since they were very helpful to each other.
