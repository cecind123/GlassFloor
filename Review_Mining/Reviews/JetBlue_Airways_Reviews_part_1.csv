rating,review
bad,Best job. WORST “Manager.” This “Operation” is a complete joke! I think the Colorado labor department would be interested in management’s dealings when it comes to forcing employees to take breaks to save the operation money.
bad,You will be terminated with no excuses if you use tech time that is allowed per their guidelines. You will be suspended for 30 days or more then will be terminated without any reasons! Do yourself and your family and stay away from jetblue and go to southwest instead!
bad,Poor Management and lack of commitment to their values.  All work groups are going union because of the poor management.  Small airline who is forgetting where they are coming from and trying to compete with the big boys.  Don't see a great future with the company
bad,"The worst job ever, they will fired people every 5 years so you dont qualify for benefits. That's why they hire almost every month. You don't see southwest hiring people every month or Delta. Answer that question!!!!"
bad,"During my interview I mentioned numerous times that I would be unable to travel daily, was told that that would not be an issue and that the company was flexible.  The first time I worked from home, I was told I was not allowed to.."
bad,"Two primary motivation factors for working at JetBlue: Flight benefits and opportunity to work from home."
bad,"The atmosphere of the leadership culture brings down the employees' morale. It's very low and almost complete lack of integrity from leaders including upper management making the place ""every day its  your last day"" ( no job security ) the push your buttons and consequently you work risking your life with the hazardous environment working in the ramp which the employee suppose to have all attention to avoid accidents. In short, there is not care for the employees because the employees reflect it working without passion. I regret to spend 5 years of my life working in such an unpleasant company. It's very sad that there are still employees that Jet Blue was or is the best company they ever worked for and don't realize because either they are too young, need the really bad, or are newcomers from the Caribbean and poor countries without means to know better"
bad,Dispuesta a trabajar con presión y armonia.  Seria un placer trabajar para esta distinguida empresa.  Reconozco que el ambiente  y servirle al publico siempre me tendrá a tida disposición.
bad,"Discrimination...Discrimination...Discrimination...Discrimination...Discrimination... "
bad,"I am a professional with a Master's Degree.  After many years of working my field, I decided for what I thought would be a relax, enjoyable field.  I knew the hours would be bad but never expected them to be so terrible that 3 days can go by without seeing my family more than 5 minutes.  The constant herrasment over every second is so stressful that you prefer to not eat all day so you dont have to go to the bathroom and get a flag.  Supervisors are terrible to approach. You know your calls are constantly monitored so you work in fear on, by experience, getting a pop-up on your screen from a supervisor, while you are with a customer on the phone, you tell you what you are doing wrong, during the call; you know after that the call will only get worse.  Yes, you fly free standby, but when?  Pay is third world country pay, specially for all the demand from you.  Rather go back to my field that deal with a company that only thinks about their pockets."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone.  I have worked in customer service for many years including 4 at Southwest Airlines.  This company was abusive and the pay was awful.  The flight benefits were not worth working there for.  The system for customer service agents was slow and made customers extremely angry.  There were many problems that could not be solved and escalating calls did not help.  I have never been so frustrated and sad with a company before.  They want it to be cool and fun and like Southwest but they took advantage of employees by offering the not great flight benefits and working from home which was a nightmare. I always felt I was taking on the customers wrath on my own everyday.  I really hope Jetblue can figure it out because it was the worst year and a half of my life.
bad,Everyone is pretty much children of 2nd grade. Your just another number with Jetblue they dont care to much of your personal issue. Only time they do is if your kissing one of the management rear end. Plain and simple if you can go to ANY OTHER AIRLINES DO IT! Least to say that Spirit airlines has a better staff then Jetblue!
bad,Don't go to work here.  They will butter you up and tell you that the culture is amazing and look at all the things you can do.  I bought into it.  After 8 years of loyalty I was let go.  Management is terrible.  They will turn on you very quickly.  Pay is terrible.  Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to work.  JetBlue is minor league.
bad,Overworked never any raises and contract was suspended. Laid off over 500 employees. learned in class room for 3 months to be laid off 3 months later.
bad,"Perhaps if they stopped firing flight attendants they wouldn't be looking to hire them all the time.  Folks beware, if you get hired, do not trust management.  No matter what they say, they are not on your side.  They have many fine respectable human beings that they get rid of on a daily basis. I questioned this, I was told there was a good reason for each of them.  Practice the integrity you preach!  A union is definitely necessary to protect the flight attendants."
bad,"I work here and am seeking another job because I love Savannah,Ga. The Management is terrible! They have no skills! They allow their employees to talk down to each other and disrespect one another. You can contact Jet Blue corporate, They will pretend like they care. They will come in and do nothing. If you want a job that works you all hours, bad pay, work with a management team that is ignorant and allows their employees to disrespect each other, you will never be able to use your flight benefits because of the way they schedule you! If you go to their training you are threatened through out the whole time that they are going to fire you. Mean while you study yourself till your sick and starve. They feed you a dry one sliced meat sandwich on a hard roll that you can not even chew! and they give you a 35 cent bag of chips plan on living on that and whatever cheap free breakfast they have at the hotel if you even have time to eat it cause you will be studying so much for fear you will be fired! Save your time this is NO PLACE TO WORK!"
bad,"jetBlue sells itself as a fun place to work but nothing could be further from the truth. The job is difficult, the workforce is fragmented and the compensation is next to nothing. Management was very inept and consiquently the workforce was very ineffective. Promised pledges of cross-training for other positions w/in the company were almost never realized."
bad,"Great place to work if your looking for a fast pace working environment. "
bad,Its all about favoritism with this company. The work is non stop and not worth the pay or benefits. It was a big disappointment working for this company.
bad,"There is to many “chiefs”. Everybody wants to micromanage everyone and everything. If you’re not favored or one of the supervisors/managers has an issue with you, they will seek to find things that can get you terminated from the company. They lack consideration for employees and their slogan of instilling humanity on the ground and in the air only Apply’s to customers. The benefits of flying are literally the only plus to the job."
bad,"JetBlue will try to get you to leave or buy you out long before retirement. Human resources are a bunch of idiots and lie constantly.  They rarely treat employees like their own core values they preach. Total mismanagement at corporate. Dont plan on making JetBlue a career and do not believe what they say about long term employment. JetBlue is in a dive and their tail is on fire, dont be surprised if they sell out to the big carriers."
bad,Ok company. Completely biased in career advancement. Zero opportunity for professional growth unless you know someone. Management has no idea what its underdogs go through on a daily basis.
bad,"Benefits:"
bad,Very good work place with supporting managers. Very comfortable office timings. Giving more chance to learn new things.
bad,"The management is horrible. There is no union so they can fire you for any little thing. The manager will tell you one thing, the supervisor will tell you another and then you have to figure it out on your own. A lot of the times when I was working there, when there was bad weather and flights would be delayed for more than 2 hours, supervisors never could be found and the people wanted to speak with a supervisor. Part time is great because you can take more advantage of the flying. The pay isn't great to live on your own but if you want to travel, have at it."
bad,"I've had many customer service jobs and JetBlue was one of the worst. Advancement is solely based on who you are friends with rather than on performance. They constantly change expectations. For example if you ""make the customer happy"" then you get in trouble for giving too many credits/refunds, if you cut back on credits/refunds then you get in trouble for not making the customer happy. They provide vague directions, refuse to provide direction in writing, then write up who they don't like (on a personal level) for following the instructions given. They set you up to fail."
bad,All of your managers and the GM are all back stabbers.  They act like your friend and then say you do things that get you in trouble.  The fellow crew members are just as bad. Very strict on the dress code.  Does not let you be yourself.  Horrible company in Denver to work for.
bad,"If the Base Managers in JFK cared about their Supervisor's and their Inflight Crewmembers the company would benefit in so many positive ways. Sending Base Managers from MCO to JFK is such a mistake in use of power by upper Management, with negative results on moral. There is no caring value whatsoever from the Base Managers in JFK. A Crewmember would be separated for a reason and another Crewmember would stay employed for that same reason under the current Base Management. Supervisor's work so hard and put in so many hours and are treated terribly by the Base Managers. The CEO needs to take a look at who is awarded these high up management positions and how these managers operate their Bases and hopefully said CEO can make change for the better in the future."
bad,"They are excellent to their customers but suck as a company. They have a very high turn over rate as far as the Boston station goes. When I left If you didn't sleep w upper management or suck up, your not going to get an advancement. "
bad,Certain people get away with many things others get punished. They talk about guests behind their backs and treat employees badly constantly telling them how they can replaced
bad,jetblue used to be a place where you would enjoy working. years passed and no supervisor or management would respect you. i been in that company for 9 yrs and seniority doesn't mean nothing. lots pf favoritism and very poor management. you will stay with a final pay rate. HORRIBLE. the only thing good about working for jetblue is the flexibility .. thats it
bad,If you’re okay with making 1200$ a month then this airline will work for you. If not seek out a legacy airline or be willing to work a second job if you can find one that will fit in with the schedule
bad,"SLC center has terrible management. Would not recommend. Nearly impossible to promote and they don't recognize talent when they see it. if you have a college degree, you will be discriminated against b/c managers don't have degrees and they are threatened by you."
bad,"The hours often changed.  We had to shift bid every 4 months."
bad,"I started at JetBlue as a pilot, in the first year of their existence. They have a record of low-pay and poor benefits, which has led to an atmosphere of bad employee morale."
bad,JetBlue states they are focused on employee relations and culture however their employment model is designed to wash through employees and have a 5 year or less longevity. JetBlue has no desire to have highly compensated long term employees. They have disparity in the way they treat employees depending on how you are favored among managers.
bad,"The problem working with Jet Blue is their management, and the decisions they make that impact not only the work environment but your life. Their management is a group of kids that have no experience whatsoever yet they get those positions because they either kiss up or personally know someone higher up. their pay is the lowest in the airline industry, and they are not unionized which is another problem. They can do whatever they want with you and you have no say whatsoever."
bad,"Jetblue really needs to take care of there employees as much as they try to take care of their customers."
bad,Start very early and work very late. very stressful job. Got to do multi tasking. Get beat up by the passengers verbally. getting to travel on other airlines is the benefit
bad,"The company used to be what every airline should model after, but after they began to grow, they turned into every other airline. You get free flight benefits, but the pay and hours are awful. There ins't room for advancement here in Denver. You would have to relocate to NYC if you can figure out how to survive on $12 an hour in Queens."
bad,"The manager of web services team does not know what he wants or, how he wants to grow his team. His lack of experience fails him to have a clear roadmap of what he wants for his team's advancement. The worst part being that the office does not have enough seats. The web services team manager has 60:40 ratio when it comes to having dedicated seats for its resources. Many resources are compelled to work remotely becos there is not enough seat within the office."
bad,Management and supervisors always writing you up so as to terminate you.  They don’t want long term employees and are trying to not meet with the union reps on any topic. Unfair work rules and long exhausting days.
bad,"This is by far one of the worst companies to ever be employed by. Do not waste your time or sanity. The company as a whole is OK and I say that loosely. However, local managers are terrible and walk around trying to make their subordinates afraid of them"
bad,"Stocking/Rec/Picking & packing of airplane parts,answering phones. i learned how much goes into the upkeep of a airline."
bad,If you want a job or a paycheck work here. It is boring and you can stay in the same position for years. Unless you are one of the good old boys. Then the opportunities are unlimited.
bad,"My typical day consisted of duties including assisting crewmembers, no clear cut rules,  the rules are unclear and vary by employee.The values are not taken into consideration. Everyone is treated differently. No consistent leadership."
bad,"Most of the issues JetBlue has is a result of leadership overstepping authority and making poverty wages the first few years. Crewmembers would be so much happier if they had leaders who cared instead of writing everyone up all of the time and made enough money to where they did not have to live with 20 other people in the bases, life would be a lot better for everyone."
bad,"JetBlue likes to tout how forward thinking they are. How they are titans of the industry and the first to do things. How disappointing it must be to do it first but execute it so poorly. Sharply functioning websites and on-time performance shouldn't be a privilege. The last three months at JetBlue were horrendous. Website errors, software/program issues, data not correctly populating and my personal favorite - LATE NIGHT/EARLY AM phone calls (yes, plural) asking for OT. System issues are abound and replicate daily. BUT wait, here's some pics and a video of our NEO aircraft. "
bad,"The airline promises allot. I worked for the airline for six years. I was an early favorite. You have a wealth of opportunity if you are the right tone,gender and orientation. "
bad,"Jetblue Doesn't have a union. They used to be a company that puts the employees first, now they put the shareholders above all. They will work their employees to the brink of exhaustion and demand you work even harder. They used to live their values but not anymore."
bad,"In order to work here you must be a robot. Never get sick, never expect to take time off to enjoy your benefits,  and don't expect support from your leader."
bad,Leadership is corrupt they block opportunities for advancement and don't allow you to learn. If your an individual that wishes to grow and learn within a company certain departments here don't allow you to do so. It's important if you want to work here that you choose the correct group.
bad,"Management was terrible and very bias openly."
bad,Management should value Crew member more. Poor use of crew members talent and also lack of caring to crew members with families. Also wen mistakes are made crew members are forced to deal with them. Jetblue assumes no responsibility
bad,"The calls are nonstop, and you will almost always deal with irate customers. They hate when you use aftercall and don't care about your mental health."
bad,I have been told by my leadership that I will never have the opportunity to advance in my career.  I have made it as far as I will ever be.  The only ones that get advanced are the friends or know someone in high places.
bad,"To start off, all call center jobs suck! The starting pay was 8.00 an hour, which is horrible. I'm not even sure if that was minimum wage. The shift is also not good for a new hire. You will get stuck on a night shift."
bad,Company talks the talk but does just the opposite in walking the walk. They risk safety of their employees consistently. Terminate unjustly. Middle management is useless. They work their flightattendants to unsafe levels from temperature conditions on transcon flights to over 18 hours in the air . Many examples of cover ups on safety etc.
bad,"I would not go back, low pay no benifits they dont care about there employees to far poor treatment dirtyP, favortisim  Planes Un Social work place, no room for  advancement not fun unorganized company not safe working comditions"
bad,"Certain policies are there for management to use against employees--clocks wouldn't work, and the employee would be docked because management would say they failed to clock in.  The company has created a culture of entitled customers and they come first, even when the employees are being treated terribly. Shifts are given by bidding, and you can end up with something completely against your availability and no one cares.  Lack of communication and they expect you to drop everything for the job. If you're part time, you still are required to work 25-30 hours a week."
bad,"Supervisor con mal carácter, no aptos para tratar con el personal"
bad,"boarding flights and ensure customers are happy with their experience."
bad,I have been working here for 4 years now and have seen a drastic culture shift. Management has been changing during this time period and what was once a highly respectable and sought after workplace is not fraught with high turnover rate among customer service reps and growing concern among employees. The frontline agents are continually taking on additional responsibilities of other departments with little additional training and now increase in pay. I am now looking for work with another company as the benefits of working at JetBlue no longer exist and the pay is much less than that of an equal position at many other companies.
bad,Flight Attendants voted for a Union a year ago solely because Management is very poor. Decisions are made for flight attendants by someone behind a desk without any inflight experience or knowledge. Then they change the decision because it didn’t work. Time and time again this happens which make the company look like it is run by idiots. Is it? Management has pitted one work group against  another which had  solely been the reason for a lower morale. When you bring something up to management even safety related YOU ARE NOT LISTENED TO.
bad,Prepare to work 13+ hour long days. You will be relocated and barely ever get to see your family or have holidays off. The management is poor and you have team leads that are suppose to be there supporting and helping you when you need it but many of them fall short of just that or simply don’t care.
bad,"Unhappy with coworkers and management because there is no accountability to each other in reference to arriving at work on time and being at assigned position  as well as crewmembers  disappearing from assigned area without notice. Crewmembers taking breaks at the same time or longer than the 30 minutes alloted"
bad,"- Conduct inventory at JFK and other 8 Material cities."
bad,"I can't believe I worked for JetBlue for 3 years!"
bad,"I cannot actually rate the entire company, but the experience I had at Orlando airport in customer service was horrible. I regret the day I applied to work at that station. This does not speak for everyone, but the majority of the people put in charge are lazy. They talk about other employees on a constant basis to everyone else. They are not willing to help when someone calls them. I have never worked at a job so bad. I have never been at a company where management works as a team with other employees to plot to get rid of other employees. People you work with cannot be trusted. They will snitch on you for doing anything wrong to make themselves look good. It was like being in high school. I also believe there was a lot of racism coming from upper management. If you choose to work for this company, do not work at this station."
bad,"Rules didn’t comply with everyone. If there was a problem w/ coworker and manager was told, nothing was done to correct it. BIG Favoritism with certain employees. People who have been there for at least two years and not able to perform their job are not held accountable and no repercussions were/are taken.  A lot of high school behavior and back stabbing                emtwfacedpeople employees people"
bad,I would love to work for this company again just because they have great values. Does management always comply to that? Different story... Not equal benefits to employees who are part time to full time and the job can be stressful at times. It’s a job more to help others I guess it depends on what airport you work but team work most of the times isn’t there.
bad,"The workload is unrealistic. They work you to the bone and keep asking for more commitment, more quality, in less time. I constantly worked much more than 40 hours/week. I worked nights, weekends, and even during vacation. Whenever I mentioned to Leadership that I had to put on all those hours to meet deadlines, they would argue that I had done that intentionally and that they had not requested that. "
bad,"Most employees are airline industry lifers. Folks stay at JetBlue for a long time, however it's primarily lateral moves. Not a place for promotion."
bad,"Between horrible social media posts from CrewMembers about other CrewMembers or Customers or the Company, overtime emails and phone calls / text messages being sent out at all times of day and night for people to ""Pick Up"" time to prevent a ""Code Red Mandatory"" caused sleepless nights.  The only time you're not required to work OT is when you have already worked 10 hours that day."
bad,I worked here for 11 1/2 years at various airports but from the time I started to now the Fun Factor left and it just became just another job where they start to make you feel like your a child and are too stupid to understand anything that goes on in the management aspect. Management kind of looks down on those that do the operation every day and don't really listen to what the folks that do the job every day have to say about it.
good,"Being a Flight Attendant for jetblue is an amazing experience. You get to travel and see many places. But with the cost rising, the airline is not meeting those expectations. They are not fixing broken planes such as broken TVs, broken WiFi, there disregarding roaches and other bugs and animals on the plane instead of disinfecting the planes. The work life balance your first couple years can be stressful but you will gain much experience. Unfortunately right now they are not unions so your job security isn’t there. You could be fired for any reason, as jetblue is an at will company."
good,"Leadership was non-existent and poor worker were often rewarded while hard workers were over looked. There is a lot of gossip, favoritism, lack of accountability, and little room for growth because of these things."
good,"All about the cliques. If you're with the right people you'll get promoted, otherwise nothing will happen. Internal promotions are based on cliques and recruiters will lie to you or have no knowledge on when a decision will be made."
good,"It’s a wage you can’t live on, no true advancement. All actions by management are punitive. Chronically understaffed, overall culture is toxic. "
good,"Working a JetBlue was very stressful. Your shifts were assigned by shift bid, the salary was so low that you couldn't support a family, and the advancememt opportunities were only available if you wanted to work full-time. I enjoyed working from home and being able to manage my own schedule but I didn't enjoy the amount of work it took to trade hours or travel. In the time I worked there I traveled once and it wasn't worth it."
good,"Great benefits, but very stressful. Life work balance does not exist and everyone must work the mandatory overtime even if you have a day off or on vacation as long as you are in the state of Florida. Paid Time Off is for vacation and sick time combined so if you are our sick, you are forced to use trade or use you time out of your vacation bank."
good,"Management is like any other place. They like you, you do good, they don't, you'll have to get by. The benefits look great on paper, but trying to use your flight benefits is very hard to do."
good,"At work on a daily basis you were met with challenges due to the lack of support because of staffing.  To be a supervisor you had to know how to multi-task. My colleagues were very supportive at all times team work was a day to day practice with our team of leaders.  However there were times that upper management could have been more supportive. Hardest part of the job was when you couldn't get support from your upper Management. So I learned  to be confident in my decisions based on my knowledge and experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flight benefits, the crewmembers and profit sharing."
good,"."
good,"I walked off out of that mass. Constant management change ! "
good,"I will recommend anyone to apply at jetBlue Airways. Great company, crewmembers are one of the best, Management is lousy but tolerable.jetBlue Airways brand is a brand you will shout from the mountain top."
good,"Challenging environment, high stress situations.  This job taught me how to respond to different situations where the customer was very upset and you needed to find the best solution in a timely manner."
good,"clean airplanes, follows TSA regulations. The management needs people with higher education. Customer service is ok. But the overall product is great."
good,good company to work for but in JFK the management is horrible.
good,"This was a great place to work back in 2003.  New owners, lots of changes.  Began playing with big boys in wall street, not good.  Demanding Mosiacs, and supervisors that expected you to do what ever a ceo wanted  right or wrong.  Employee support went down hill.  The flying benefits after one reaches 10 years stink, your standby status is lower than another airline employee, the bottom of the bottom...great way to say thanks for all your hard work for 10 years!"
good,"JetBlue is in the forefront of many new technologies and new customer initiatives. Resources are dragged through the mud with poor work life balance. "
good,Now Corperate America mentality.  Unfair environment.  Long time dedicated employees treated as a number.  No loyalty.  The airline has changed from the model it was originally designed to be after the CEO and founder was asked to leave.  Very sad situation.
good,"JetBlue offers flexible work hours, autonomy to work, flight benefits for FTE, Leadership needs improvement."
good,JetBlue is a really good company to work for but they don't offer maternity leave. Compensation is not competitive and the culture is fading. Everyone does not live the values.
good,Great benefits dying and etc.. The company only cares about customers. They don't value your handwork. I only stayed for the flying benefits and the flexibility with hours..The rest is horrible very stressful.
good,"Work was as a contractor on a temporary assignment. Work hours were off shift. Managers were very good. Job was adequate for a temporary assignment. Pay was low, with no benefits."
good,I have never seen the CEO. He should be out here more seeing what is going on. Wish he'd be on undercover BOSS. Understand why a 50c raise sucks for me living in Boston. Just amazes me how they've made it this long. Wish someone would hurry up and buy us and make us better.
good,Jetblue has great travel bennfits. There not much room for advancement unless you are willing to travel
good,"The customer's were the most enjoyable part of the job. The management, was mediocre, and unsympathetic."
good,A company that has no union. At will employees. I worked for this company for 8 years. I started at the bottom and worked my way up the ladder.
good,JetBlue is a good company for someone who is starting off in the industry.   There are some promotional opportunities but depending on what area yo whork in it can be limited
good,"There is good and bad in most jobs. The company has great ideals but the airports level is something entirely different. Its worth a shot to try. The main focus locations are big and many flights go in and out of those locations. The positions have become micro positions and there is plenty of micromanagement. The travel industry is very high stress and safety is of the most important, It is necessary to take the job seriously and work wisely. The pay is not good and the hours are horrible. To get the time off that you require you need to trade with your fellow crewmembers. Customers don't really see you as a person and neither does the majority of your supervisors."
good,"When I started with JetBlue it was back in 2007 only seven years after starting operations.  The company had a great vibe to it and was a really awesome place to work.  You could literally feel your impact on the overall operation from day to day.  The culture was one that was so unique that you wouldn't even consider leaving.  It was one of the best jobs I ever had.  "
good,"Overall the company is great. However if you planning to work in PHL station get ready to be discriminate and get fired, or be buddy buddy with management (female) and secure your job. It's unfortunatly how many people get terminated because the supervisor did not liked them but they were a great employee. "
good,Great company if you live in the east coast but not much advancement if you live in the west coast. Overall Jetblue provides employees a great vehicle to travel.
good,"The location I was working was treated much differently than about 90& of the rest of the locations. This location was over worked, lack of communication, not enough workers, overworked, very busy, some leaders and managers were a bit unfair and played favoritism. "
good,"Company runs lean,work 2 jobs for the price of one.Always short staffed, always training new people. Very hard to use travel benefit, due to staffing."
good,"a typical day enatiled being called out by the scheduling department and you were given 2 hours to get to the gate. middle management was whom we came into contact with, however there was never a feel of support from middle management, it was more a dictatorship mentality. You went to work each day not knowing if one mistake would cost you your job, job security was non existent at Jet blue and because of this middle management abused it.  Upper managemet relied on middle management reports and so little got change."
good,"JetBlue is a good place to work. However, I am looking to leave the airline industry and pursue a new career in a different customer service field. I have grown tired of all the traveling, living out of a suitcase, staying at hotels and the overall environment of the airline industry. On the upside, I have made many great friends, seen a lot of places and adapted to the fast past lifestyle. The one thing that I really dislike about the job is that I live in Charlotte but I am based out of Boston. My job requires me to commute by plane weekly. My life, family and friends are all here in Charlotte and this is where I want to be. Thank you!"
good,"Co workers are fun to be around, fast pace environment, great flight benefits. Accountability needs to be improved from supervisors on up through management. Everyone seems to want to just ""pass the buck"" so they do not have to deal with the problem. High expectations for minimal pay. Desperately understaffed at this specific location."
good,"always very busy, management was great in JFK, BOS, DTW and RIC. In MCO the management was not helpful, sneaky and extremely dishonest"
good,"No career advancements."
good,Have learned to lead others and assist in completing thier daily assignments. Maintained their aircraft parts inventory.
good,"Its a great job if you like to travel. The flying benefits are great, you get to fly for free with almost every domestic airline and many international."
good,"What can I say besides that the work was alright you have your good days and bad days, but like most other companies management is just trash. And don't bother looking for a promotion or job transfer unless you live in JFK or BOS."
good,"As an Airport Operation agent (AO) at JFK can be overwhelming if your just starting and with all policy changes everyday. Low paying job under $15 dollars an hour and Non-union expect for flight attendants & Pilots."
good,"I handle between 50 to 70 customer calls on the days I work. While the health and flight benefits are great. The pay does not give me enough to support my family. The paid time off is earned. They do allow trading for shifts. I have had multiple supervisors, due to acting positions that they have taken. The hardest part of my job is when the customer is not providing information, talking over, or not accepting the provided information, and so you do not get a negativity score on a call you cannot take a more firm position. The breaks are earned time off the phone by a percentage. Some days the breaks are not enough if your feeling ill, have a family issue that arises, or just have several difficult calls in a row."
good,"If you think standby flying is worth it for really wearing down your body, then go for it. The pay isn't great, so it's best to make a deal with someone you can find to cooperate to reduce the days you're there. Longer hours and less days at work is great, being there more often for shorter shifts makes it feel like a waste of time. "
good,"on the paper everything is good."
good,If you want to use this company as a way into the aviation business then this is the perfect place to start. Its not for ideal for someone who is looking for a forever work enviorment
good,"JetBlue has a lot of culture. They celebrate every holiday with a party or barbecue and participate in things that is happening around the city. "
good,JetBlue as a whole is an amazing corporation. However the PHL Station has a very low morale. When I worked there in the first 12 months that station lost 13 crew members!! They have a very low retention level. The management team is the problem and for whatever reason the senior executives haven't figured that out yet.
good,"The job is pretty physically demanding, which isn't much of a problem. The job requires you to be outside in the elements for long periods at a time, which I think is the most challenging. I would transport customer's luggage from flight to flight  dock airplanes. The workplace environment isn't as upbeat as I'd wish it would be unfortunately, but I make it work. I did however learn a plethora about the ins and outs of the airplanes. Quite exciting!"
good,"Can be exciting working for an airline, both customer service and ground crew. Flying benefits and potential to move up if you are willing to move. Work/life balance can be rough sometimes. Operations are 24/7/365."
good,your life will revolve around work nothing else but work. they will suspend you for the simplest thing as reaching work 1 min late due to the unexpected events in Boston during the different seasons
good,"Unlimited flight benefits for employees but not with the familiy members traveling on their own with your buddy passes as there are very limited flights coming from Salt Lake."
good,Each day is different working at the LAS station. You don't know whether you may have a smooth day or the most busiest day of your career. Delayed or cancelled flights made this job very fast paced. Loved the benefits the company offered.
good,"Loved the position as a flight attendant. The travel benefits were excellent, and pay scale was very competitive."
good,A day at work implies taking phone calls. I learned a lot about the airlines industry.
good,"I am very detailed and have much emphasis on profitability.  That was challenging as my local leadership were not on board.  Instead of embracing my ideas which were proven financially, I was blocked from offering these suggestions to higher ups.  "
good,If you got in off the street they treat you like an outsider. It very tough to break in to the group. If they like you they'll make sure you succeed. If they don't they let you fall flat on your face. Which is what happened to me. They gave 2 chances but the second time around the group made me feel like I was really isolated. Be aware if you are hired off the street you maybe isolated if you don't fit in to the group dynamic.
good,"I loved my time at Jetblue however, the way things are set up with their union and job protection needs work. It is very flexible as well, but they could improve their PTO & sick day bank. Maternity leave is only available if you have accured PTO over time. Commuting can become an issue because of depending on where you live can be difficult as well as finding a great crash pad or living situation."
good,"Typical day is simple but can be stressful due to delays or repair issues. Most time spent checking in customers, boarding fights, cleaning, and handling baggage. Lacks team work culture. Every man for themselves and older crew feel entitled to do less work because they have higher seniority. Flight benefits are a plus and profit sharing is good also opportunity for advancement comes around pretty often to different departments. Pay could be higher and go up at a faster rate but other than that an okay job."
good,"Benefits are great especially if you like to travel but with such a low per hour wage, it's extremely difficult to advantage of them. Management needs better communication, as well as the mentality of passing blame to as many people as possible. Favoritism needs to change as its one main reason as the turnover rate is high. Most importantly wages need to be improved. Overall if you keep to yourself and take advantage of new opportunities its a great place to work."
good,"Not enough pay for the amount of stress during work hours and certainly not enough pay to compensate for the amount of time required outside of work hours to manage your schedule, read the millions of corporate emails and be on call 24/7 for mandatory overtime."
good,I worked for JB for more than 10 years. I was given lots of opportunities to advance my career. I learned a lot about the airline industry. The airline industry is a lot of fun.
good,"Typical work day varied, airport jobs include checking customers in, working the gate area and boarding customers, selling tickets. Worked closely with other crew members . My favorite part was the people. I loved interacting with all the different people."
good,"This job can be very exhausting but also fun and promising. I worked full time and didn't get to travel as much as I wanted to so if you choose the same hours expect the same result. I think it is best for part-timers as it is ideal for travel and your less likely to burn out when you are required to stay past your shift due to delays and/or cancellations. patience is a must because customers can be crazy when it comes to lost baggage, delayed or missed flights. Sometimes you can empathize but theres no need for half of the antics they pull."
good,"Management was horrible, definitely picked and choosed favorites, which made work life very difficult. "
good,"JetBlue Airways is a good business to work for."
good,Taxi in and out aircraft from gate. Loading and off loading bags from aircraft and then going to designated belt to off load bags. Working on the move team to move aircraft from gate to gate or other designated spots for aircraft. Working in the bag room and loading bags for outbound flights.
good,"Pre/post flight inspections. A inspections every now and then."
good,"JetBlue Airways is a great place to work they live by their values, crewmembers have total control of their schedules where they can exchange and be off if someone can take their shifts."
good,Fun Workplace I learned how to interact with many different cultures working at jetblue.I was given an opportunity to work in the Acting Supervisory position.The most Enjoyable part of my job was asssiting customers with their needs while traveling making it as easy as possible.
good,"You can't take any time off for 90 days without getting fired even if you are on your death bed. Working part time is a better option here. They micromanage every second of your work life. You do a lot of off the clock work. My supervisor expected me to do a lot of off the clock training. Didn't mind taking the calls and working with customers. If you want to advance, you have to donate time without pay to train or learn more about opportunities."
good,"Pros"
good,They don’t care about their employees you’re just a number. No job security you can get fired over anything if they don’t like you. Do yourself a favor and work at a airline that has a union.
good,"hours are very flexible, and is pleasant to work here."
good,"Working for the company is an amazing experience. Upper management is always seeking for ways to compensate the employees. However, local management isn't as caring as it should be. Unfortunately, job opportunities are not available to everyone, mostly to those that are closer to management. Work values... even if you work your required hours, is expected that you work more hours, not as Overtime Pay. "
good,GReat place to work if you like airplanes and fast paced environment nice people and i got to travel to lots of fantastic places you would like to work here too
good,"The airline industry presents an ever-changing environment.  New challenges arise each day dealing with the traveling public.  This held true working at JetBlue.  Myriad factors played a part in the daily operation like weather, equipment reliability, and security.  Dealing with various agencies like the TSA, FAA, or airport authorities could make life a juggling act.  Also, industry competition is a constant so the approach to day-to-day operations change somewhat frequently.  "
good,Its all what you make about it. Jetblue has its pros and cons like any other job. They care for employs in many ways. Knowing your rules is always a plus since sometimes inconsistency may occur.There are many good people that are always willing to help.
good,This job can bcc e very stressful especially during bug huge storm back east when the planes are grounded. There us nothing we can do and it's very frustrating for passengers stuck in airports.
good,Great place to have fun and try something new.  I enjoyed flying a lot but the market crashed and i had to find a new job.  The travel can be tiring but over all fun.
good,"hardest part of work is the weather. hard work, need more compensation. over all the work experience is not bad, just have to work a lot of hours to make a decent salary."
good,"Customer interaction"
good,"This company likes to reinvent the wheel. If it’s not broke, they like to fix it, and if it is broke, they don’t fix it. Reserve rules are awful, the pay is below industry standard, the work rules are terrible and there are many loopholes. The flight benefits are decent for the size of the company, but employees pay fees to sit in the premium cabin, where other airlines don’t have to."
good,"Great place to work from home. The hours are very competitive and you have to do a shift bid. Sometimes you get the short end of the stick, which I did and had to leave due to a schedule that would not work for me."
good,"it was a great place to work crew members are great never had a problem with anyone, the company takes great care of there employees, just need to be alittle more organized"
good,Sometimes it's great to work there. Other times it the worst place in the world. You're expected to do jobs you weren't hired for. The pay was horrible. I only put five stars for compensation and benefits is because the free flights for you and immediate family.
good,"Constant changes keep you on your toes, but also keep you learning and adapting. I learned excellent customer service at the airline. The growth is steady, and can sometimes be uncomfortable due to the constant changes, but is still necessary."
good,"My experience with this company has been nothing short of dreadful. Supervisors show up late or not at all, and the GM is very naive to his surroundings."
good,"My typical day at work is very easy because of my past work experience and solid years of experience in Customer service,Management,Sales,Budget control,supervision,Time and Leadership."
good,"travel perks are wonderful and the culture is fun. However, the opportunity for growth is quite limited. very high turnover rate in certain departments."
good,"Ferrari Color is one of the best printing companies the Country, Life working for such a big company is very fast and demanding the turn times that some Customers asked were always met."
good,"This position requires the highest level of customer service.  You must be able to work with other crew members in a team environment to insure the safety & comfort of 100+ passengers on up to 4 flights a day.  I've learned to think creatively in solving problems & managing difficult customers & co-workers.  The hardest part of this job is extremely long hours (up to 18), only getting paid for flight hours & being away form home up to 4 days every week."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to call them family
good,"It is a very good company with excellent benefits, it allows you to grow fairly easy within the company as long as you demonstrate your interest and skills."
good,Drive truck to Long Beach Airport and provision Jetblue planes.
good,This Carreer is a path where everyday is different the base is the same however always new and different aspects. I manage a team which changes everyday I am confident and multi task as I am always on the go.
good,"I was very excited to start work for JetBlue.  I was excited to share the flight benefits, and learn something knew.  However it was very clear almost immediately that using the flight benefits was nearly impossible, and the pay did not outweigh the high stress of this job.  I learned a lot, and gained some very valuable experience, and made life long friends.  However, the pay and benefits package needs an overhaul and I wouldn't advise anyone to work from Salt Lake just for the flight benefits.  I worked there for 2 1/2 years and only took 3 trips."
good,It is a good company. Great benefits and a strong sense of involvement in the team.
good,"Although I was not a full time employee nor was I considered permanent, I enjoyed my years of work at this company. Very fast paced and interesting atmosphere to work in. I also worked with very nice people whom I still connect with."
good,"A lot has changed over the years at Jetblue, not for the better. At this particular station, there is a lot of down time. Great employees for the most part, but if there is a problem with a coworker, don't expect it to be resolved. People can get away with doing very little or inadequate work for years. Management is less than stellar, pretty much hands off. People come and go, no one cares, you're easily replaced."
good,"high paced hard working people great planes in Logan airport in Boston,Mass."
good,I only work with them for a month. So far was a got company. Did like the travel benefits and hotel discounts. Only downside was when traveling they are station in New York so every flight you have to stop in New York in order to get to where you are going.
good,"Make it work for you...start forward job. If you're looking for a career idk...it could happen. Benefits are great, pay not the greatest. Physical job."
good,"Provide quality attention and care to our employees and providers. Sample Supports recognizes that our primary function is supporting and training our direct care providers well as they in turn provide excellent care to the clients in our services. We believe that happy employees and providers result in happy clients."
good,"Very Good Company, very stressful and fun job at the same time. "
good,fast active very productive getting aircraft out on time enjoyed the communication between techs and pilots and other crew members getting aircraft out in a timely manner.
good,jetBlue is a great work environment but lacks great leadership. As a crewmember with jetBlue I was always worried about losing my job for simple reason. I couldn't count on leadership to back me in any serious situation outside of work family issues nothing. I lost my home as always showed up to work and was fired for being late with no understanding from the company.
good,"Jet blue is a good company to work for. There is a lot to do with very few people and resources, but the opportunities for growth, at least in technical operations is very limited."
good,"Has its moment, it can be really busy and really slow however the most excitement comes when things are busy because it the time everyone meaning customers are angry. I-rate customers are sometimes upset for something that has nothing to do with the airline but its still exciting dealing with them"
good,"JetBlue was my last job. It was productive and fun work place. I worked from home, that was the best, that was the most enjoyable part of the job. Typical day at work, woke up, had breakfast and work in my PJs sometimes. I have learned a lot, how to deal with customers, learned new systems. Managements are excellent, but supervisor are not typical I like her to be. I liked most of my co workers, but I don't get to see them because we all worked at home. The hardest part about my job is the expectations. We have to stay focus and keep working all the time, no inactivity what so ever and we have to meet the criteria and goals. They monitored us all the time, watched and listen to us work. Worst part is lack of training. I enjoyed the most was my flight benefits and able to stay home and enjoy my family."
good,The Group of people i worked with are the most wonderful group of people you can wish for. If I could Do it all over again i would choose to work with them over and over again.
good,"I loved working for JetBlue.  They have a wonderful corporate culture and for the most part, the people are top-notch.  However, it was the lowest-paying job I've had in 20 years.  So if you aren't the primary breadwinner in your family, it's an ideal job, otherwise you'll kill yourself working extra to make ends meet.  "
good,"Working for jetblue is awesome! Its fun, its upbeat, its fast paced but jetblue in fort Myers is a dull station."
good,"As a leader I come to work and assign my team the positions for the day to work on the operation and conduct daily briefings and debrefings at the begining and end of every shift. Approve shift changes and vacations aswell as payroll. Attend to airport meetings representing the company. "
good,"They say that your schedule is flexible but in all reality it isn’t. You must trade your shift with another employee which requires trade boards on Facebook. Many employees practice unfair trading by picking up your hours in exchange for two to three times their own. You must earn PTO and this is used for vacation, sick time or emergencies which causes you to quickly burn up your PTO. The job does offer man benefits such as 401k, stock, medical and discounts."
good,"Like every company, they look out for themselves before the workers so don’t get caught up in the videos or values that are seen or mentioned.  Once you’re onboard, the company seems to forget its values that they drill in you."
good,"start 0330 and work until 0800 or 1000 or whenever flights were in the air, if delayed, had to stay, some shifts turned from 4 hours to 12."
good,"The company is good but make sure you are fully aware of who you are working with as far as your leadership. They say they have your best interest at heart, but not always do."
good,"The culture and work environment was great when it started in 1999. As it grows, the company thinks less about the employees and more about profits. They are not supportive and there is no job security whatsoever. They don't have a contract, so work rules and conditions change regularly without notice and without input from the employees. It's unfortunate, because it's a great airline for the passengers. Employees just aren't valued at all."
good,"A typical day at work for me is audting Reservations as to why a fee was waived or a card is refunded. We take that information and send it to our management team who reviews and makes recommendations on how to proceed with future changes. "
good,"Great benefits. Very diversited atmosphere. Management was not the best during my time there. A lot of letters downs and expectation disappoints. Favoritism was a problem. Was not the fairly after I returned from a militarh deployment with an injury, eventually was terminated."
good,I like the job but the hours didn't quite work for me because I had an infant and I had to work a lot of hours. Code red was super stressful specially when you have small children
good,"The job experience that I had with jetblue was not the greatest, I had managers that I did not feel addressed my concerns and I did not feel as though I mattered to the company at all as an employee"
good,"Great Company"
good,"Working for an airline is high stress with working weekend and nights, and unpredictable weather may cause you to get stuck at work without much notice. This company has a fair wage, but is not very high. There is a lot of advancement in-house, but opportunities are highly competitive."
good,"Call center environment was very fast paced, one call after another. I helped customers book new reservations or change existing reservations and answered any questions they might have about their travel on JetBlue."
good,Good place to work but there no job security they need a union. Human Resources doesn't help you in anyway and if someone in management doesn't like you they get rid of you. But other then that you meet great people working there I can say proudly that i love my jetblue co workers the work is tough at first but you get used to it like any job. Best thing is to see and push planes out towards the runway. Every crew member is great and the great perk is that you can travel for free
good,"Fun but you need to know people to move up, but besides that your coworkers don’t work as a team player and also not taking safety a real deal on the ramp!!!"
good,Very up beat and interactive environment keeps you physically fit and working hand in hand with planes you learn a lot its stresses safety.
good,"Generally fun work environment. Co-Workers in general of great to work with.  However, very difficult to advance within the company or explore other career options with in the cooperate division of the company."
good,"working with nicest people contribute to productivity in the work.Willing to help supervisors on the side, helps with any questions or hardship that might occur in the work.I have net and befriend a lot of people who works alongside me, makes each day worth comming to work..the hardest part of this job is dealing with customers on the phone when mother nature strikes on bad weather and customers are compalingin about flight delays, we are always have to be at our best and patience is all we need to store up within us in order to help reschedule any customer on different flight, I learn a great dealt on being out of myself and try my very best to stay calm and understand the frustrations of customers due to flight being delayed or cancel, but the most enjoyble part is when customers return with satisfaction outcome and express appreciation makes my day worth the stress.."
good,It was an ok place to work however shift changed every 6 months.
good,good company to work for that looks out of its employees. It is a fast pace job with difficult hours. If you love to travel it is a great company to work for.
good,"I thank them to give me the opportunity to join the company, I learned a lot and worked there for almost 4 years. the hardest part of the job was the annoying customers that missed their flights or luggage and when there were cancellations and the long standing period. "
good,"I would go into work and look to see where I would be placed that day. I was trained in loading and balancing the aircraft, unloading, fueling, directing and driving the aircraft into dock, customer service, all airports codes and hazmat signals, my day would be one of these services or several services."
good,Working there was mixed feelings. Sometimes great sometimes discouraging. Work place culture was fair. A typical day at work could be challenging and so days are fun.
good,"No room for advancement at HPN unless you are GM pet if gm dosent like"
good,"I love JetBlue. I loved flying and meeting new team members. However the position grew tiring for me, its a hard lifestyle to keep up with - living out of a suitcase and never being home. I miss it for sure and highly reccommend working here."
good,"Nice to work from home, but the expectations are unrealistic.Hours are set based on a shift bid base on seniority. However the lower levels get the unwanted shifts."
good,"I believe this company was once a great place to work with wonderful benefits, including flight privileges. However, the culture of the company has changed tremendously in the past couple of years and that has negatively impacted their employees and their customers. There is almost no support from supervisors or upper management. There is also a great “tattle” culture at the particular station I was assigned to.worked at , which encouraged people to no longer act as adults  and instead constantly whine to supervisors about their interpersonal issues. This information is then shared from those supervisors to all the other crew members working there. I’ve never worked for a business that wa"
good,"Good benefits, Fast paced work environment, Good company, Depending on job title and station you work at job can be good. Competitive, cant say much for the quality of people."
good,"Great place to work, but quality of life can suffer, and there is a severe disconnect between the everyday frontline workforce, middle/upper management."
good,Didn't get to experience much. Seasonal work so I didn't get to explore further opportunities within the company
good,"One of the best benefit packages you will find in the industry. Great co workers "
good,"Although I very much enjoyed being an inflight crew member with JetBlue, I found it very difficult to balance work, my physical health and my finances. I loved being in the air and it was my absolute pleasure serving our customers and ensuring a safe, fun and professional flight experience. However, most times I found myself on At Home Standby or Airport Standby, which meant not only was I not flying, I was not making money. I will still forever be grateful and proud that out of 4,000 applicants for my specific class, only 37 made the training program, and 31 of us actually completed."
good,JetBlue as a company is a good employer and cares about their Crewmembers.  They try to keep everyone happy and listen to each voice.  However my particular department was poorly managed and it was time to leave.
good,"This is a great job for anyone who loves travel. Great perks and benefits to do so.  Most feel very overworked and unappreciated by year two, hence very high turnover."
good,At the time is was a growing Airline. They were young and energetic. I worked at JFK airport and it was an enjoyable work environment.
good,"I loved my job. Its a great industry to meet people of different walks of life. This job is very fast pace and stressful. If you crack under pressure the Airline business is definitely not for you. Overall, jetBlue is by far the best company I have worked for it offers great benefits but job advancement is very difficult."
good,The JetBlue experience is great. Just a few things I didn't really enjoy while being here but overall its a great company to work for and would definitely recommend them!
good,"Fun job"
good,Upper leadership does not care or stand by their employees.  Great people work really hard to make this company successful but they are not recognized or rewarded.  No appreciation for the dedication or hard work provided.
good,"I love airplanes, airlines, and all things airports .. if you're the same, airport operations may be the right job for you.  Jetblue has great values that it tries to live out.  I appreciate the culture.  You will have excellent travel benefits and medical, dental, and optical benefits."
good,Working with the airlines was a very fun and busy place to work at. the hours were tough. When it was busy it was a lot of fun made the time go by fast.
good,The people are definitely what sets JetBlue apart from the competition. It is because of the people I worked with that I looked forward to going to work every morning.
good,"JetBlue Airways is one of the few airlines actually making a profit. The corporate values (safety, caring, integrity, fun, and passion) shine at the brass levels of management but dissipate exponentially as they trickle down the management vine."
good,Co worker were like family. Management In Long Beach great the GM really cares about employees.
good,"JetBlue is a great place to work. I have loved my time with this company. They make you feel welcomed, special, and apart of a bigger purpose. They like to go all-out with orientations and making you feel like you want to be there. "
good,"I sadly got stuck working for one of the most ill motivated  leadership teams in the JetBlue system. "
good,"I was a seasonal employee and applied to be made permanent. The deadline for applications  came and passed and I was told they never received my application so I wouldn’t be considered even though I was an exemplary employee. When the season was over I was dismissed. I kept applying every time their was an opening after that but no results even though I was experienced, so I gave up."
good,Senior management out of touch with Manager and  Supervisor work load. Every year there we were expected to do more with less.  Most people there were great to work with.
good,"Great culture and fun people, but not competitive wages.  Very little development and some room for growth.  Great travel benefits and discounts offset the lower wages to be fair."
good,"This varies from station to station, but since JFK is a hub station your workload is often packed and on a tight time table. The physical labor can get intense, particularly during times of extreme weather."
good,"Fun place to work very expensive place to live. great healthcare even if you have to pay for it.time was good and 10 hr shifts at night"
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, beautiful office. Employees are motivated to help the airline grow and to help each other. People are very nice and truly care about making the world a better place."
good,Work is face paced and high stress. I have learned how to coordinate communication between multiple teams and management. I have learned how to analyze call volume and effectively represent real time date in a manor easy to understand. I have learned a proficiency with Microsoft Office and Excel. I educate and troubleshoot problems with customer-facing teams. The hardest part of the job is trying to advance. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make a difference in so many people lives.
good,Although a smaller hub environment than my previous employer I found employee morale to be great and the compensation outstanding.
good,It was a great work place with amazing people that would help out with almost anything making you feel like a real family. Best part was helping customers who really need more time or just someone to hear them out when they felt frustrated with the day.
good,Working during irregular operations (IROPs) is the hardest part of the job. Flight Benefits were great. Multiple schedule available was hard to choose .
good,"Coworker at your level are really friendly, as soon as they get promoted that changes. The managment could be worked on to seem more friendly and approachable."
good,It was a great work experience and met very good people. The turn over rate was a bit high but I still a manged to learn a lot about how to handle projects and time.
good,It is fixed schedule and you can pick up more hours of desire. Ot was fun and interesting bit ot sid have alot of favorite. Found that to get ahead the Managers had ro favor.
good,"•	Provide exceptional customer service "
good,"I interned at JetBlue for a full year. However, I was unable to obtain a full time position because there were no openings at the time. Traveling for free was the greatest perk I will ever have had."
good,"If you are ready to learn the aviation sector from Ground Operations, to Quality Customer Service Care, then jetBlue is the place."
good,"After working for JetBlue for over 16 years, this is what I found."
good,Overall experience working at JetBlue was a positive one. Even entry-level employees are given the opportunity to make changes in the organization and change the future of JetBlue.
good,"Unlimited trading, you can swap your shifts around and work up to 60 hours per week. Super helpful if you have kids or attend school.  You do have to go to Florida for training."
good,Good People to work with. Training for position is positive. Local Management is responsive to needs. Health Care coverage could be better as current plan for health and dental cover pretty much minimum coverage.
good,"I really love this company and I love the industry. Standard call-center metrics, PTO  and shift bid is standard in the industry. High turnover is standard as well. The company gave pretty big bonuses as a result of profitability which is a great reward that validates a team mentality."
good,"If you are not looking to make a lot of money this is a great place to work at and have more autonomy than in other corporations. It really has great leaders.It also has the standard dysfunctions of other places."
good,"Great P/T job for working at home.  I enjoyed working here, but it was time to pay for kids tuition. I would recommend this work at home job to a friend."
good,"It was great to work in the airline industry. I learned a lot about how flying works. It was stressful talking to customers, looking up their flight information and trying to get all the required items into the call.  you were required to ask a lot of different things, and if you didn't you were marked down for the call. Some people were rude and disrespectful to you on the phone. You always had a time limit for everything. There flight benefit were also bad, it just wasn't worth flying on your own planes. Flying non-rev is very difficult most of the times. And there weren't very many places to fly on the west coast, or even the united states as a whole. Mostly out of the country. The best thing about working for JeBlue was being able to work at home. but, if your machine , power outage, or anything went down, you had a certain about of time to drive up to the call center and work from there. in some cases, it was a 30-45 min drive to get there.I was good at customer service and received perfect reviews many times. Towards the end of my time at JetBlue, their mainframe/network needed upgrading. The changed everything and everyone over to a new program. It made it somewhat difficult for me to do a professional job. I did meet a lot of great people there."
good,"Training was in depth, management was fair and understanding, i genuinely enjoyed my job, the hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers due to delayed flights however jetblue provided us with the tools we needed to make customers feel informed and compensated"
good,"Prepare and generate daily grants reconciliations"
good,"Wonderful opportunity to get a glimpse of the world and traveling. Many days you just feel blessed to be there, other days your'e pretty over it. These feelings come with any customer service job. Delays make days unbearably long and you must work hard to find the true balance.  Flying often can really take a toll on the body physically- some may feel it more than others and the overall job can be extremely subjective. The trade off includes- super flexible schedule after about 7-8 months, deeply discounted flights, and more days off in a month than your average Joe or Josephine. Still a bit of tweaking as far a management and leadership but I strongly believe in the companies continued growth and  success."
good,Hardest part of the job is the unnecessary competition amongst fellow crewmembers. Most enjoyable is being able to make a difference to customers by creating moments of magic. Also interacting with those from other countries and learning about their cultures - both customers and crewmembers.
good,"Like anything else, this company has its high points but also its drawbacks. It has steady work and company growth. It offers decent benefits but it could be better especially if there was a union present."
good,"Accomplished and results driven technical management professional with 13+ years of extensive experience in technical architecture design, development and functional expertise in various implementations of enterprise applications. "
good,All the members are very helpful . Management is well organized . And a lot of room to grow . Excellent working environment
good,Fun place to work.  Different kind of life style.  Very adaptable to the employees situation.  Allowed me great flexibility.
good,"My department is going through some changes and there are a few headaches, upper management needs to come down to the trenches more often however overall it's a good company to work for."
good,"I would travel between two sites over the course of 3 months, learning the various job positions that Jet Blue had to offer. The average person seemed content with their daily duties and encouraged me to stay in school and shoot for the stars. This was a positive experience and an overall friendly environment."
good,"I really enjoy working for an Airline, flying benefits is one of the perk that got me addictive. JetBlue has a good culture, however it's changing."
good,"JetBlue is an interesting place to work. I learned some things to add to my experience here. The management could be better ,but overall it is a cool place to work."
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. Job is adaptable.
good,It's a good place to work but not much room for growth for a lot of people.
good,"JetBlue as a whole is a great company to work for. The company values of Safety, Caring, Fun, Integrity, Passion are followed."
good,"Nothing much to say about my current Job; It usually starts out with a briefing from the previous shift and then it runs as normal everyone is assigned a task for the day, some may be hard depending on the workload especially responding to all requests from other departments. I have learnt how to be a leader and how to train new hires. Management is average you really deal with them except the supervisors on duty. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to train new hires and sharing my knowledge with them until they are fully ready for the operation. Co-workers make my day go by fast, they are fun and caring. We joke around but make sure the work is done.   "
good,great service.  pro active approace across the board. fun and active place to work especially on summer when its time to play ping-pong and basketball.
good,"Conducted check-in process for customers via computer. Tags, lifts, and handles customer luggage. Announced flight arrivals, departures, and pre-boarding information via the public address system. Meet and assist with flight arrivals and departures. Coordinate various duties with coworkers and other depts. to ensure proper handling of customers."
good,"busy productive, hard part was dealing with delayed flights but the challenge was great"
good,"JetBlue is a great company, it's only downfall is that career advancement is limited outside of New York."
good,"Responsible for each and every aspect of in-flight safety and customer service. Successfully completed training in various safety procedures including emergency-exit use, first-aid, CPR Certified, fire, water and hijacking emergencies. Understand airline rules and regulations for Domestic and International Travel."
good,Outbound calls to customers everyday. Involves long hours of work daily. Keeps me busy.
good,Overall a nice place to work. The pay is fair. Flexible schedules. Crewmembers work to help each other. Positive climate. Opportunities to transfer to other positions.
good,"Simply wished the pay compensation was more, its a great job but i cannot believe to know that some people do this full time. how do they survive on that salary."
good,"Not the worst place to work, but also no where near the best.Start on midnights ,then good chance of going to another base.People that I work with are good people."
good,"Company provides some opportunity for growth within, but not as much as it used to or as much as it claims to. Good people working there, but the commercial people (marketing, especially) are competitive and cut throat - usually to the company's detriment. Benefits worsened over time, pay was average. Met great lifelong friends here and would go back in the future, but was glad to leave to get experience from how other industries do business."
good,Working at jetblue is great as terms of benefits and job security. But the job is really for young talent to learn about the industry. But pay is not great but work is great but too much for some. Jfk it self is really difficult because there are alot of bad apples. But if you do your job and kiss alot of management butt youll advance where you need to be.
good,JetBlue is a very good company to work for management is easy to work with the hours are long and being on reserve is very hard especially if you're a single parent and don't have a support group to help with childcare.
good,"Good company but it's going through a rough patch right now, which is really negatively affecting morale, especially with newer employees. Little job security due to lack of union."
good,"Fun uplifting work culture when there is a good manager.  Many managers do not have the skill set to become managers and are made manager pre maturely causing problems for the employees."
good,"Jetblue is a company with great culture. For the most part, there is much optimism and support from both management and coworkers. The core values of this company are morally positive."
good,You get to enjoy travel benefits on the weekends. Travelling on the weekends is a great benefit not only for full-time employees but also interns has been a great perk and a pleasure.
good,From start to finish it is lights camera action. Never a dull moment nor boring day. Management needed support to onward support the crewmembers and crewmembers onward to customers. The employees are always supportive to each other for a balance. The hardest part of the day was the inoperable flights or cancelled flights. The best part of the day was the fulfillment of getting the job done.
good,"JetBlue is a very caring organization and treats its crewmembers well. The corporate culture encourages diversity and supports an extremely giving volunteer and community support culture as well, which is one of the great aspects of this organization."
good,"Management could be a lot better, they do not want to leave the crew lounge to help you unless they have to do a gate check. Work place culture is safety first but you have to wonder who's safety they are talking about sometimes. Customer is always right even when the company is paying them to tell on someone."
good,"The company has a good value system and sometimes being that there are so many supervisors and mangers for different times of day there is quite a lot of micro managing and people looking out for themselves. The work load is heavy as a GO and is not reflected in the pay. You lift heavy bags, do a large amount of flights and get held back 3 hours a day, sometimes back to back. They see it as the benefits make up for it all. They expect you to be at work no matter what happens to you and have a system set so even when you call out and have a serious emergency with evidence, you still get reprimanded. But all in all the community is amazing and you find some of the best coworkers in a setting such as JetBlue."
good,My time here was fun to work. You will learn alot about the airline industry no matter what position you take. the benefits are pretty good. Can be stressful at times bt that comes with any Job.
good,"Worked flights to assist in safety.  Making sure the passengers were happy and safe throughout the flight."
good,"JB is a good company which started with great expectations and valued its employees. First 10 years the company operated like a family, however the operation method changed later as the company grew, more business minded."
good,This is a great place to work but it's not competitive in pay and it's very difficult to move around without knowing someone. The company has a great culture in the sense of a lot of outside of work activities to participate in. Management can be a little clannish in the sense that if one doesn't like you the rest wont.
good,"good company to work for co workers act like little kids  ,love to make the customers happy and coming back just a good company to work for just bad cuz of the co workers"
good,"      I am a part time which means my shifts are five hours.  A usual workload is three ""Turns"" which means arrival and departure.  We offload the luggage from the inbound flight and upload the baggage for the departing flight.  It is hard work because the cargo bins are only about four feet in height.  Most of the time we are on our knees and duck our heads not to hit the ceiling which has metal grates which can cause injury.  "
good,JetBlue has a great set of values and has a solid culture of people.
good,The Job is good but 8 hours in a ticket counter lifting bags is an exhausting journey
good,Working for JetBlue has great traveling benefits. It may be a bit difficult to obtain a higher position in the company unless you know someone. Other than that it is a very flexible job once you have some time in the company.
good,"Definitely a fun place to work. However, with only night flights from PHX, the only option is an evening shift. "
good,Loved working here. Loved the free flights and the schedule flexibility. I go to meet many hard working people and made connections that will last a lifetime.
good,"Over all JetBlue is an amazing company! The culture and support is clear from day one. You are not a number here. "
good,If you are the sole provider for your family being a phone agent at Jet Blue may not pay enough to allow you to pay for all the necessary things to live. If you and your spouse work it would be great because you have flight benefits.
good,"needs a union or some staff representation. low pay, poor management but overall a fun fast paced place to work. I would recommend only after your retired and can afford your living already."
good,"Great place to work with a great culture but not much opportunity at corporate."
good,This was the best Job I had. I worked with good people. I was able to work my way up and was promoted to supervisor at a very young age. They prepare there staff with recurrent training and it is an overall positive work place.
good,Do not expect to survive from the pay but great flight benefits. Bright future ahead of it with major plans to expand to different destinations. potential to grow and move up is very high.
good,"Aviation is always unpredictable but fun. Some days can be long hard and challenging but always rewarding."
good,It was a good job. Had different sections of what to do for work for example you can pick up a bag room utilities ramp move team airport operations a lot of different options
good,"JetBlue Culture focuses on Customer Service and making sure our customers receive the most pleasant service at all contact points. "
good,JetBlue is a relatively new airline. They love to hire younger people who are attending college or have recently graduated. Great job for return missionaries who are bilingual. Not the best place for advancement if you do not have a college degree or are over 50.
good,"JetBlue was a solid place to work.  Nice people, who generally want to do the right thing, but lots of red tape, too.  Health benefits are expensive and do not adequately cover families; barely cover individuals.  Travel perks are of course great."
good,"During my time at JetBlue I made life long friendships and learned first hand about customer service. I appreciate the time I spent there as they prepared me to handle high demand, fast paced jobs."
good,"A typical day at work for myself is responding to emails, coaching, mentoring, developing crewmembers, and ensuring safety is our number one value."
good,"Opportunities are limited unless you are friendly with upper Leadership.  Work Life balance is really great, but again that depends on which department you work for.  Location of the corporate offices can be problematic unless you utilize public transportation.  Pay and compensation for some departments lag behind IT and Tech Ops.  Influx of inexperienced (but educated) Crewmembers."
good,"Great company with great benefits, awesome place to work for, one of the best airlines in the business, just an awesome place to be everyday"
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits.  Enjoyed working with some crew members.  The company really cares about their passengers and their employees and it shows."
good,Working for JetBlue was a great experience. All my co-workers were great to work with. The worst part of the job had to be the weather conditions. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility you get with the through their website the allows to to post all shifts so any crewmember with the same work skill can pick it up. Management in my department has their ups and downs but management in the overall company is great.
good,Great culture and exciting place to work.  The company is growing quickly but still tries to maintain the small company feel.  Fast-paced keeps things interesting.
good,"Good company to work for. Unfortunately there is no union for the rampers, agents or in-flight crew. I did tons of travel, so I cannot complain."
good,JetBlue was a great company to work for. My co workers where amazing. Everyday was a new adventure. I loved it!!
good,"A typical day at work for jetBlue would be punching in and heading to briefing to go over the flight load and any special events going on for that day. I learned a lot as far as dealing with customers and crew members, management wasn't always the best, as I feel the best way to lead is by example and that wasn't always the case. We would usually work in teams of four through out the day and I had the privilege to work with some really special guys. I guess the hardest part of our job was dealing with the elements day in and day out as New York weather tends to be a little crazy year round. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing directly with customers and helping them feel at ease when traveling."
good,Great co-workers. Moving up can be a little bit difficult at times.
good,"A typical day at JetBlue includes reading and responding emails, monitoring aircraft inventory using our Inventory Management software and interacting with multiple departments in an attempt to balance our stock. The people at JetBlue makes this process easier with their easy going persona and willingness to help. The hardest part of the day would be juggling multiple projects from management to finish in a timely manner."
good,Was a great place to work. Interacted with a diverse group of people on a daily bases. No two days were the same. Sometimes had to work long hours when bad weather hit. Got to see the world on someone else dime.
good,JetBlue was an amazing company to work for. I worked for LiveTV which is owned by Jet Blue they are a young company and had many issues adjusting to changes in a young business.
good,management need to do a better job. overall a good company if you can get in. Become friends with your supervisors.
good,nice job to work for i really had a good experience working for the company
good,"It is a great place to work, just wish the pay scale was inline with other airlines...Southwest. employees were great. Some of the supervisors were okay...but overall great place to work, better when they adjust the pay scale."
good,While ground operations is considered the bottom its a little more laid back but can be physically exhausting at times and still lacking in a livable wage
good,"A day on the job is based on shipping, Ground operations support, Tech support and data entry amongst other things. Great Leadership. A great culture full of people from all walks of life."
good,Had a good product and fairly good work environment. They did like you to progress and learn to parts of the company and promote. Travel benefits were good but not great from SLC.
good,JetBlue could benefit from having better people in supervisor positions. The job is extremely flexible so if done properly and responsibly you can work when you want.
good,agency with a long-term focus and commitment to working to improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities.  We are continuously re-designing our programs to ensure that we are offering the most innovative options to help our clients achieve increased independence and stability in their lives while also ensuring they are setting and meeting their personal goals.
good,JetBlue as a growing company is a great place to work and co-workers treat each other like family. Benefits are great and most leaders are dedicated to company culture and values.
good,Overall the company is good to work for and you get some very nice perks. Locally things are a little different as it is with every station. Working on the ramp is not difficult but the Station Operations Coordinator position gives some good mental challenges.
good,A typical day starts with thousands of passengers looking to check in their bags for their upcoming flights.  You have 3 minutes to take their bags and give them seats. you have to answer all questions they might have.  In case of canceled flights you have to rebooked them on the next flights.  you have to make sure all connecting flights is rebooked and that their bags are routed to their final destinations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people From all over the world
good,jetblue is a good company to work  with it during my yrs with they a had a very bad manager  until he was fired for taken funds from the company now they have a better manager
good,Great flight benefits. Very easy to make your own schedule. Never really interacted much with management. Some supervisors were great. Can have long days. Many chances to see different places.
good,"Fun workplace with lots of travel benefits, fast paced, great values, provides leadership and technical training for all employees, great flexibility and advancement."
good,Need to be able to give excellent customer service. Have to work over time when large weather event cause problems. Need to give great customer service while keeper the amount of time on the phone  within Jetblue call restrictions.
good,"Working at JetBlue Airways was a great experience! Although our Airport Manager had shady business practices, the company overall is one of the best in the airline industry! I would work for JetBlue again in a heartbeat!"
good,"Middle management and below love what they do and work toward a common goal. Above middle management leaders seem disconnected. They make sure to give employees more work than they likely should, and career advancement is a little more challenging to achieve than other places."
good,"Never a dull day in the operations at JFK, everyday is a new experience and always something new to learn. The training is great and they are always improving on training and improving the work environment."
good,Jetblue is a great company to work for. The culture of the company will make anyone feel welcomed. The toughest part of the job is working IROPS and long hours. The perks and benefits are great.
good,"People are nice and friendly"
good,great environment to work in with good benefits. You have the ability to grow and learn as well as interact with many different people. A great experience.
good,"JetBlue Airways is a fantastic place to work for regular and part time employees. The travel benefits are the best in the industry, and make up for the difference in pay. The teamwork amongst regular crewmembers is also great. It is a fun place to work, and is ideal for someone with more flexibility and the love of traveling."
good,"It was a stay at home job.  It was difficult because you were constantly on the phone, call after call.  We had Co-workers who were above us and helped us with any questions or concerns.  The hardest part of the job was when customers would get upset with you when you had no control over it.  I loved being a part of JetBlue but had a hard time using the benefits because of the schedule."
good,"Typical day: Park in the garage, walk to the elevator, wait for a bus, go to your terminal stop, walk in and clock in. It takes 15min-30min to get to where you need to go when you park. After that, check the board and see where you are and who you are working with. You'll be assigned flights on the ramp or a carousel in the bag room. Bag room: sit at the carousel all day and put luggage in a cart after you scan it. Ramp: Plane service, load/unload luggage, and wing walk it out to taxi. It is a demanding job but you can take a lot of breaks either between flights or a scheduled break in the bag room. At the end of the day clock out and do step 1 in reverse. You'll earn about an extra hour a day at the airport by going to and leaving jetblue, but hey, parking is free if you find a spot."
good,"Love working at JetBlue, but not fond of commuting to DCA for work. I live in Florida. Little chance of getting back to MCO."
good,Enjoyable working environment. Flexible scheduling gives you the opportunity to trade shifts with other employees. Overall good place to work.
good,"JetBlue is a wonderful company to work for, benefits are great, salary is competitive to other airlines.  There is some much needed work to be done in Ft. Lauderdale as a base being a focus city but overall it is a great corporation to work with."
good,"The culture at JetBlue promotes ""you above all"" and the company really stands behind their promises.  As an employee in a support center, my experience is slightly different than someone working in an airport or operations setting, however, I truly value the culture and emphasis on the core values - safety, integrity, passion, caring and fun."
good,"JetBlue is a great company that sincerely cares about its crewmembers.  Historically, it was seen as a very innovative and nimble company, but as it has matured, that has been more difficult to perpetuate. The company prides itself on being contrarian and unique in the experience it offers customers, but there is an important balance between being customer-focused and responsible to shareholders."
good,"Wonderful culture, startup attitude and innovative brand in fast growing New York company."
good,"I enjoyed working for JetBlue for most of my time there, but towards the end the Management shifted to something that made the job more a chore then a fun experience."
good,"Typical day as a ground operative would intel loading and offloading baggage, pushing out aircrafts. As a ticket Agent would intel customer service. Assigning people to flights and lading their baggage. "
good,"I had an opportunity to open a new city with JetBlue airways, in Long Beach California, had a great experience working as a customer service agent."
good,Great people to work for. You will work hard but the co-workers will make up for it. If you like to travel this is the place for you
good,I enjoyed doing the job. I have learnt patience among developed other qualities for personal enhancement.
good,"Customers are the best part of this job, we had so many AWESOME customers who really gave us all we needed. Putting smiles on our faces and grateful for our patience, and time. The management was always there if you needed them no matter what. My co-workers were amazing they always were there to lift up your spirits no matter what. The hardest part of my job was having a customer give me a reason they could not make their flight which was usually a death or sickness in the family and I personally could not accomadate them and had to send them to a supervisor. I wanted to help everyone the best I could."
good,Working at jetBlue airways is an great experience. I dont know anyone who doesnt want to work for jetBlue. JetBlue has great vaules that they follow all threw out the corporation. The hardest part about my job is the employees. Some employees just dont know how to appreicate a job when the have one.
good,"JetBlue's culture is the biggest draw, as a rapidly growing but still young company in the airline industry. The commercial team is responsible for driving nearly all of the revenue and making nearly all brand and marketing decisions. The revenue and marketing teams work closely to identify strengths and weaknesses in the commercial strategy, and use each others' resources to make key business decisions to cement JetBlue's market share."
good,"Learned great deal from fellow workers, great chance for advancement."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at JetBlue, but being a flight attendant was exhausting and was only meant to be a short 5 year career for myself. The company has great benefits, lots of resources for employees to succeed, a fair amount of staff appreciation, and for the most part there was a good amount of happiness amount my coworkers. Other than the industry itself being draining, full of long days, working holidays, etc the company itself is pretty great!"
good,"It depends on what City you work at It also depends on the Ethics of your Station Manager Remember whatever Behavior the Station Manager has, so does his Supervisors. And then if  it's negative it trickles down to the Crew. If it's positive then it would be a Outstanding Crew including the Captains and Flight Attendants. Everyone is affected by the behavior of Station Managet.the Station"
good,Jetblue culture is great and involving with the peers. Don’t get me wrong if your part of customer service its the best place to work. I just wish pay can be more competitive.
good,Great place to work There is room for growth. The overall structure of the company is great. The station's culture is good. With all things there is room for improvement.
good,"Great job with flight benefits. Love working from home, but wish the pay were better. Great supervisor, who cares about the employees on her team.  The job has strict metrics that must be met, including talk time."
good,Overall good company to start out in the airline industry. Good flight benefits and wonderful product to give to customers. Good 401k and stock options
good,"Mi última experiencia fue en Atlanta com Jetblue. Fue buena pues trabajé en AO, que es Airport Operations. Mi fuerte es la rampa por muchos años."
good,JetBlue is a great company with plenty of opportunities but you would need to relocate to New York for the majority of the opportunities once you get into the management level. The company has a great culture and the benefits are great.
good,"Wonderfully flexible. The culture is great. Safety, Integrity, Fun, Caring, Passion. It is the embodiment of the workplace. The hardest is customer de-escalation. The most enjoyable, the people you work with are the most caring and compassionate group."
good,"Jetblue was a great company with great people who loved the early days at the airline.  "
good,"The culture is what keeps me at JetBlue. They stay true to the company values, and there are countless opportunities in various areas. I enjoy the luxury of getting to travel and see the world."
good,"Great place to work at and amazing people to meet. Full of energy, never a dull moment. Competitive stacking and a fast pase work environment. Great benefits and amazing travel abilities."
good,Nice experience. The ideal job to improve pro-activity. Fast paced and delicate operations where the crewmembers need to focus to keep all the information to avoid mistakes due to security and safety matters.
good,"hardest for me , when i received a dead customer on board , so i called all the personel we need in this case and handle the situation the right way without other customers notice what was the real situation so to avoid panic on board"
good,Be patient when it comes to being called for flights. The hardest part of the job is being away from home for extended time. Also the lack of steady flights to be worked and time for new flight attendants to get hours flying.
good,"You Can Make Your Own Schedule, with exception of meeting quarterly hours. Jobs can be tough at times but it all depends on the attitude you come to work with. EVERYONE is friendly and kind. VERY GREAT family culture."
good,"A pretty easy job."
good,I can honestly say that I love this job.  I love taking care of customers and this was a perfect marriage of my two degrees that I have.  I love the benefits of the job and so does my mom and nephew.  I would recommend to many people to try this company for at least a short while if anything.  My only complaint is that they do not uphold the values that they stand for.
good,"The culture at JetBlue is like no other, they really value their employees and their customers. Benefits are ok if you work full time. Very flexible, basically able to work as much or little as you want. Travel benefits are good too."
good,"The company is great. It isn't ideal for everyone to include myself because of the constant change of schedule. But comes with great benefits, and perks. Very family oriented company."
good,"This opportunity was definitely challenging as a female.  Enjoyed the fast paced work environment not to mention the knowledge acquired in this part of the airline experience.  "
good,Weekly sprints and learning new methods and technologies in mobile app development. Luckily had helpful and encouraging teammates.
good,"The company has a great culture, flexible schedule and overall positive environment. In the past few years, it has been getting a bit investor-centered and that is affecting the overall morale of the employees. Pay is sub-par when compared to other airlines but the company has a no furlough policy that makes the job a bit more secure than others. There are lots of good people working here and it makes you feel like part of a family."
good,"This is a very good company to work for, Very flexible schedules, diverse culture and great benefits."
good,I had to relocate due to family circumstances and left my previous position in order to make the move.
good,"Fly for free what more could you ask for.  "
good,"Co-workers are fantastic, supervisors always willing to help you improve your skills."
good,Such an exciting place to meet new people.  Travel perks.  Hardest part of the job is the initial training.  Going through jetBlue University.. Most intense three weeks.  All of your time is spent learning the aviation system.
good,"Job duties comes in variety of ways and I tend to try and enjoy my Job no matter what it is, a job is a job and I use my knowledge, skills and training to apply to the duties. I normally find ways to let my day at work go easy, be friendly, humble to coworkers, be aggressive to my duties and ensure it is done in a timely matter. I try not to get in management way at work as they have their duties to perform unless I have too. My coworkers I try and get acquainted to as it at times will make our atmosphere a little more comfortable to work in. The hardest part of a job for me is the not know of or where to go and how to get things done.  The most enjoyable part is to know I make a difference and the job results is satisfying to my effort and I am with it also."
good,As an Airline they truly try to help the passenger out.  As an employee your co workers become your family
good,Nice group of people to work with on a shift basis. Flexibility with work schedule.
good,"Jetblue is one of the top airlines to work for. Good benefits, great direction, strong values and from my opinion, will only grow stronger in the coming years"
good,"Great company to work for. Flexible schedule and great coworkers. The pay is great over time. Very close-knit, family-like environment. In Long Beach the hours are low, but the quality of life is great in California. I enjoyed working at Jetblue."
good,"This job has its perks. If you love to travel, this company can help you with that! You meet knew people everyday and learn new things. Every airport varies."
good,Loved working for the airline and helping customers with their baggage claim needs.  Customer service was a huge part of my job and I always wanted to be there for the customer.
good,Most usually work in this industry for the benefits and it was well worth it. I enjoyed my time here and would recommend it to anyone who is interested.
good,"- JetBlue offers quite good work/life balance here. People working here have a lot of time to travel, learn and do other things they like.  "
good,A typical day at work would be busy and customer focused.  The hardest part of the job is when flights are delayed or canceled. Flight benefits are the best.
good,"It's a good company that attracts good, talented people and has a great mission to Inspire Humanity.  I learned and grew a lot there. Salaries aren't great but flight benefits are nice."
good,Very diverse. I was able to work independently and when needed worked well with the team. It was great to travel for work as it was a great way to network with other colleges
good,They try to pitch pay being low because you get to work from home. But you still have all the same bills as someone who doesn’t. It really doesn’t even out. Being a bilingual agent you’ll make a little more but still not enough. They really need to raise their wages for work at home associates.
good,I had  great 3 years here.  The management team was awesome as well as the executive team was exceptional.  I would recommend working here to anyone!.
good,"Great staff, small station but lots of very committed workforce. I have moved up very quickly in the last years working closely with management and the ramp crew."
good,"Review and verify appropriate identification and checked in customers for flights"
good,Good company seeking the interest of employees.  It gives one the opportunity to use the skills that you came to the job with. It allows innovation.  It allowed me to use my education to further the mission.  It has a great deal of flexibility and it has room for growth.
good,Great team fast paced. It was a fantastic learning experience I definitely would recommend the job to whom seem interested. I would go back if given the chance
good,"truly a family feel with the company.  training is A+, you do know your job once you complete.  "
good,Long days with delays. Flight benefits are great. Learned how to always be the answer for the customer. Manager and supervisors were great. Crewmembers were like family.
good,"Pay wasn't that great and the hours sucked even after I had worked there for over two years, but the job was good, and the environment was great."
good,One of the best things about this company was that flying was always free. the company always was looking out for their crewmembers. I had the ability to fly with any other airline in New York or in the world as long as we had an agreement with that company.
good,"Typical day of work is busy, as you are working in an airport.  I've definitely sharpened up on my customer service skills. Management is cool. The culture is youthful and fun. Hardest part of the job is dealing with long delays and upset customers. The most enjoyable part is getting to travel and making your own schedule once you get seniority."
good,"Overall its a decent job to work at. Some days are rough, but that happens with any job. You really improve your hospitality skills with customers and your fellow crew members. There are many chances to move up in this company."
good,there is room for advancement good people to work around. i learn a lot while i was employed for jet blue. once you're willing to learn they would always teach you new things.
good,"Revenue Management is a great place to start your airline career. Learned a lot of transferable skills and a lot about the airline industry. Unfortunately, strategic and analytical thinking is discouraged after a certain level as management keeps the decision making very close to their chest, even when the data doesn't support their decisions."
good,If you enjoy working in an environment that changes on a daily basis then this is the best place for you. Its hard to plan anything because it could change at any minute.
good,I enjoyed working at JetBlue.  I loved the culture because It was a family type of environment.  The work was exciting because of the fast paced environment.
good,"Working for 5 years at JetBlue has been quite the journey thus far. Traveling from point A to point B is pretty neat all while building a rapport with my customers and crew and giving a great service and hospitable inflight experience. Ive learned and acquired many skills while being an Inflight Crewmember for JetBlue. The management is always looking out for the best interest in us and they always seem to have our back when and if something goes down at work. The job brings along challenges of weather, delays and tough customers to deal with at times. However, traveling, building relationships with other crew and customers, along with the amazing company culture and working for an employer rated #12 out of top 500 employers in the US for 2016 by Forbes Magazine says a lot. I enjoy my career dearly."

good,"jetBlue is an awesome place to work for. You work from home, flexible hours, flight benefits. Too bad nobody ever told me about jetBlue having therapies. Due to fast pace, back to back phone calls plus problems at home. I got myself into a deep depression. During my suspension process, there was no sympathy with managers. I would reapply obviously for flexible schedules and flight benefits."
good,JetBlue a good company to work for. They take care of their employees. The company is growing and with that comes some growing pains but they do well at making changes fairly quickly.

Some of the leadership team were great to work with and other needed to go to back to leadership school. But other than that I made great friends great co-workers. I learned alot more things about the airline industry."
good,You feel like you are a part of the decision making process here. Leadership is open and honest for the most part.

good,"My typical day at work was checking in for my assignment. Meeting with the crew prior to reaching the aircraft. Ensured all passenger needs were met with regard to comfort and safety throughout their entire flight. The crew & I would ensure that first-aid kits and other emergency equipment were aboard and in working order, along with adequate supplies of food, beverages, and blankets. I've learned a lot about safety and FAA regulations. My co-workers worked as a team to make our job fun and productive we would learn new things day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job was our layovers and traveling around the whole world and back. The hardest part of the job was the safety of our passengers."

good,"Working at Jetblue is a wonderful experience and allows an avid traveler or adventurous explorer to be able to explore and see the world while working or enjoying the perks while off work at incredible discounts and rates.The people are great and are very passionate about what they do. Days and people are difficult and challenging. Delays affect not just the airline and passengers but you as well, so making sure you have a good balanced diet and food prepared and brought with you for those times you don't have the option to grab food anywhere really comes in handy and gives you that needed energy boost. However, meeting people from all walks of life and all around the world is wonderful and truly makes you realize the world is so big and there are so many people trying to live their day to day lives as best as possible with what they are given."
good,It is a good job your co workers work just as hard as you. You have to maintain all allocations at your job to make sure you inventory meets expectations.
good,I really enjoyed working at jet blue. I learned how to scan and keep control of items being shipped in
good,"I love my job and benefits are great, but as a single person the pay is not enough for me to only have one job. However, schedules are extremely flexible. Management and Supervisors are awesome."
good,Great place to work. I would have stayed if the pay would have been better. I did not care for the shift bids. It made it hard to plan your family life.
good,Management was amazing. They were always willing to work around my schedule to insure that I could be at home with my kids when they needed me most.  I loved the flexibility this job offered as well.
good,"My experience with Jetblue was exceptional. I enjoyed moving around the company, the perks were great, I travelled often, Plenty of overtime, and made plenty of friends."
good,An airline with fun in their core values need I say more. the airline was in new york so being that they did not stay Pittsburgh did stink but not enough to not go back.
good,"Fun place to work, great crew and leadership. New challenges every day. Get to meet a lot of new people."
good,"Great place to work, great coworkers, everyone is caring, everyone works together as an team. There is lots of room for growth with in the company. An great place to work!"
good,I would say this position is for someone that doesn’t have a family or responsibilities because the pay is not something you can survive off of. Co workers you work with become family. You will get flagged for anything which is an easy way to termination. Manger wasn’t caring at all only recognized your flaws verses the good you done for them and their company. They talk about caring as a big value but lack of use of the value.
good,jetblue airways is an awesome place to work with great pay and benefits...they paid for training and uniform allowance....great people working there
good,great place to work if you travel a lot. the flight benefits are unlimited within the US and low rates to international countries
good,"I have been with the organization for over 6 years and at times it has been great at other times very challenging.  Direction can be unclear and lacking. Work life balance is a challenge, expectations are you should be available all day every day.  But if you enjoy being in a team environment and working hard than it is a magical place"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew"
good,Overall corporate culture is great and if you can relocate to NY then it would be a great job.  Local airports struggle to keep good management.  Work is fun and people are generally good.
good,"One of the best cultures in NYC. By far the best airline operations center in America. Strong values with a lot of cultural diversity. Fun atmosphere, caring vibe."
good,I have always enjoyed working in the airport environment. The work is interesting and I would very often learn new things on the job. Meeting co-workers and customers from different countries and diverse backgrounds have broadened my own horizons.
good,It was not a job but a career. I learned about dealing with all kinds of customers and experience. How to handle high stress situations and fix problems on the spot.
good,"I liked working at this job. it was a great job started early ended around 4 or 5.            "
good,"It's a pretty good company to work at. It has a lot of perks and I would reccomend family, friends and any other individual to apply because it is a great start"
good,Everything that is heard about JetBlue being a good company to work for is true and the people are really great to work with. Management does questionable things at times but all good
good,jetblue values their employees the most. you feel part of a family and not just a job. they are always looking for ways to be transparent to the whole company to have inclusion
good,Working at JetBlue Las Vegas is rewarding and challenging at the same time.  The hardest part of this job is getting used to the weather.  The most enjoyable part is meeting new people all the time.
good,Awesome company to work for.  Must work as a Team to accomplish daily goals.  Great benefits.  Great training.  Only negative would be having to clean aircraft wearing dress and heels.
good,"Checking-in passengers for their flights, booking flights for passengers without a reservation, i also was resposible for boarding flights and aslo assisting with other flights."
good,"Very good airline to work for, emphasizes working efficiently, safely, and timely to ensure on time departures and to provide the best customer service available."
good,Great experience.  Lots of experience at the line.  good team work.  Lots of good benefits and travel.  Great 401k  options.  Fairly new planes with lots of good options.
good,but because the job is so flexible you do find your getting drowned in over 50-70 hours a week and I was only part time. you have to be compliant and avoid using your pto unless you have more than 10 hours
good,"Excellent place to work, I have been working here for a long time and find it to be a very open and pleasant environment. There a are a lot of nice people on all levels."
good,Would most definitely recommend to anyone to work here - great values and they really care about their employees. Amazing culture and support from leadership.
good,work should never feel like work. A work place should always make you feel comfortable and enjoyable looking forward to get to work.a work environment should feel family welcome.
good,Jet Blue is my ultimate company to work for. I was given the opportunity to undergo training but unfortunately I was unsuccessful in one area and was not made to complete the program. I respected that as it showed integrity. Through training the instructors were consistent and well verse. Great experience.
good,Fun workplace which allows employees to have work life balance. Ernst and Young offers on-going training and lots of resources for staff to self-study.
good,"Very fun environment, although we worked from home, the company offered lots of fun filled events for employees to attend. Supervisors were very knowledgeable and helpful."
good,This is one of the better airlines out there. The company puts an emphasis on treating people well (both employees and customers). The compensation was well above average.
good,"Good culture, good benefits, good work balance."
good,"Load and unload planes. Pretty laid back company, only have to work when your plane lands and when you send one out. Other than that a lot of down time."
good,"Great co-workers, enjoyed the travel perks. As with any airline, it has it's ups and downs, but the good totally out weigh the bad!"
good,"Great company but moving up is all politics and salary is low. However, the work environment is wonderful and so are all of the Crewmembers. It is a company I love and believe in."
good,loved what i did. loved who i worked with. needed more growth opportunities. jetblue is a great company to work for. there core values is what makes them successful along with a great goal oriented staff and management.

good,Good place and fun environment to work in and I love it and there is no other place I would rather be than to work for jetblue!
good,"An enjoyable work place , full of excitement and fast paced work with supportive management. it is fun working in that place so much that don't know when all those years passed with a smile. it is not all about the time and numbers but it gives you personally grow and develop as a person. it is too crowded and very busy but it is expected from a really big and growing well known company. ."
good,"I typical day for me is assisting the operation, following up with daily emails, and providing any training im instructed to setup."
good,"The days can vary depending on weather, cancellations, delays, staffing, and customer needs. Listening to the customer and assisting them with their travel needs, ensuring that the experience from beginning to end is positive making the job very fullfiling. "
good,"Hands down, one of the best places to work! The one word, dynamic, is the best description of the work pace. If you like deadline oriented, seat of your pants customer service, here's your place."
good,I work for this great company which is JetBlue Airways. They dedicated to bring humanity back to air travel. They have 83 destinations both domestic and international and they headquarter is located in New York.
good,This is a leading Airline. The environment is very welcoming. The standard of service is high and the company has a great eye for class.
good,Working at JetBlue Airways is a great opportunity to experience and should never be passed up if given the chance to work here. They have great leadership with understanding and caring in any situation.

I love learning something new to better my skills to help myself grow. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner. And always making sure the job gets done!
good,"Awesome atmosphere to work in. So much fun going to the airport to work every day. Learned exceptional customer service skills. Learned how to work under pressure and on a tight deadline. Deplaning 150 people, cleaning and servicing and aircraft, then boarding up 150 people in 40 minutes was always a welcome challenge. Was taught the importance of filling out paperwork correctly. Giving a solid foundation to grow as am employee. Always had a fun time at work while remembering the task at hand."
good,A very Excellent award winning company that I enjoy working for.
good,"loved the company left to pursue engineering job"
good,The company was created on strong core values to cultivate a fun filled work environment. No day is the same and the company continued success hosts countless opportunities to grow.
good,"A typical day at work, usually we had daily briefing with all the facility managers and we discussed what we were able to accomplished on a nightly basis."
good,"A typical day at Jet Blue consisted of coordinating schedules for the departure and arrival of Jet Blue customers. I did everything from running bags to the bag room, putting bags on the plane, hooking up water to the aircraft, wing walking, and airport provisioning cross training (catering on the aircraft). The most enjoyable part about this job was that I got to work outside and really get to know my co workers on a more personal level. The hardest part of the job was when it got really cold/hot outside and doing strenuous manual labor."
good,"I learned a lot of customer service skills, interpersonal skills etc."
good,"-Conducted and coordinated escorts and tours within airport areas"
good,Everyday is exciting!! Travel Benefits are worth it! One of my favorite jobs I've had!

good,Many opportunities to try new things. Leadership is friendly and helpful.
good,"Great place to work until mike barger took over. culture changed, and it became continental airlines."
good,"A typical day at work would be to prepare flights for departures, board customers, meet inbound flights, check in customers answer any questions customers may have, change flights for the customer. Great communication skills with customers and co-workers. Management needed improvement. Co-workers were helpful and good friends. The hardest part of the job was working alone. The most enjoyable part of the job was boarding the customers and having early flights. A great company to work for. Overall Rating is 5 stars."
good,"College Crew 2011. Great learning experience, great people to work with. Everyone was very helpful."
good,"Jetblue really lets you feel the Blue juice, but the station you work at is not all that great at times. Sometimes management has to set by example and most time one is not ready for that, because they have no clue about the job functions."
good,"Job was very fun but a little stressful. you need a lot of customer service. Benefits are great, and the people are amazing."
good,Very team oriented environment. Everyone works well together to give the best customer service possible. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet for extended periods of time. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and working with a variety of people.
good,Working at JetBlue was a great experience.  Serving the public is what I enjoyed the most.  Meeting people from all around the world is great and I definitely utilized my travel privileges.
good,A good company to work for although the physical labor will take its toll
good,"Had random schedules, but I loved it. I was always ready to perform at my best and do my job duty. I learned the systems of Jet Blue, flying procedures, and requirements, and I learned great discipline for being on time!!! Self motivation played a big part in my environment of being at home. I loved the diverse culture of jet blue, the benefits, and the people. Awesome opportunity."
good,Excellent work environment and a great place to learn and grow
good,Very Challenging and demanding. but great company to work for.
good,"I learn a little more about baseball, how to work at a faster pace, I learn how to asst. the grillman"
good,"A place of fun personalities  Each day is different and able to acquire knowledge of the operation, A very proactive and energetic environment. A good job to boost your personal growth."
good,"Great culture, friendly people, thoughtful and smart colleagues, great culture with a lot of interesting opportunities for interns. Tough to advance and the salary is low."
good,I love the brand it was a  very fun place to work  the hardest part of  the job was when we were short handed  I really learn patience and being polite took you a long way
good,"Jetblue is a fun and very family oriented place to work. I love it at LGA, The management are very supportive and helps when in need, and the staffing are wonderful"
good,"I absolutely love the company and management. It's the super low hourly wages that has me disappointed with the company. Yes you get the perks of flying for free but that means little to nothing if you aren't making enough to take care of your family. The company is growing wildly so for big stations (JFK, MCO, BOS, FLL) hours are plentiful HOWEVER if you are in a small station like BNA with only 3 flights you are only going to get 20 hours a week MAX is you work mornings and 25 hours if you work afternoons."
good,"Living the values JetBlue Airways constantly teaches their crew has led me to live my life the same way. "
good,JetBlue was an excellent company to work for. The culture in JetBlue specifically the contact center was almost a family type business. Working for them for the 8 years or so was something I was planning on doing for the foreseeable future. When they outsourced their IT department to Verizon I stayed on with Verizon almost as a way to make sure JetBlue received the best support I was able to give them.
good,"I assisted the reservation and airline agents with problems they experienced trying to change reservations, waive fees or honor different fare requests. I enjoyed great support from management in giving me the flexibility to do my job with minimal supervision."
good,No day is ever the same. Always something new and a strong customer service skills are required.
good,Job is very cool. Nothing too special besides loading or unloading an aircraft. Management is typical but could be better. Supervisors are usual at every job outgoing and respectful. There really is no hard part of this job.
good,I enjoyed working with my crew members. All my life I've been fascinated with airplanes and working for JetBlue Airways was a dream come true.
good,"Exciting, fun and highly entertaining. Professional and world class customer service. I love wearing an immaculate uniform. Staff welfare and morale is top priority. Advocates diversity and inclusion."
good,Jet Blue treated me like gold. Did a part time temp position there and they asked me to stay on but I declined.  I LOVED the job but the hours did not suit me as my kids were babies/toddler. The pay was not worth for me to drive there. Management and corporate were great.
good,Stay on top of your dreams with this company unlimited travel schedules are flexible pay is good you can make as much as you like but take time to travel and enjoy life also
good,Fast paced. Family oriented. Amazing Scheduling placement and flexibility options. Great travel benefits. Very happy there and intend to retire from the company.
good,If you don’t know the airline industry then it might be hard to adjust to. It has flexible hours for the most part but if there are delays you can stay past your scheduled hours. You know what time to come in but you might not always leave on time. Maybe even stay over night. It’s a 24/7 operation depending on the station.
good,"Awesome benefits...overall good place to work...very diverse staff...pay scale could be better ....not many advancement opportunities."
good,Good people. your skills will be challenged daily.  Flight benefits are great. everything about JB is good except for the location. L.I.C. is a tough commute
good,Best company ive ever worked for.  It is just not enough hours and there is no benefits for part timers.  I hopefully can manage 2 jobs at once so I can still work here.  I want to still work for them.
good,"good environment, fun culture, delays and cancellations are the hardest to deal with as well as entitled customers. Management is very green in the lower levels."
good,"Watched the organization grow organically. Great benefits and values. Was awesome to have gotten in when the company was building the brand, felt a part of something special."
good,"great people to work with, They try to empower you to make the right choices with out customers. Fly for free and Free Pizza."
good,I loved this job.  I enjoyed working with people on the phones and giving the best customer experience that was possible.  I enjoyed co-workers and management interactions.
good,"•	12 years of successful performance in diverse roles across our continuously evolving and dynamic company"
good,"This is a great company. Wonderful people and fun environment. It is different from other airline carriers and Jetblue prides itself in that. Every job has its pros and cons, and here, there are more pros than cons. The company is growing and is getting better slowly but surely. Good things are to come, all in due time."
good,I was in the place they call the bag room and the department was short staffed that night. they had assigned me to work a Santo Domingo flight and a florida flight by myself. the Santo domingo flight had 280 bags and the florida flight had 185 bags. I had to load all those bags on the cart and send them out on time so the flight will not be delayed.
good,"This is a good job. My work day is pretty much routine, more physical than mental. Management is okay, I work with a lot of great people. The hardest part of my day are the outdoor environments (ex. weather). The most enjoyable part of my job are the benefits. I fly for free anywhere jetblue flies."
good,"Great work life balance, with very flexible schedule. Management is very approachable and open to input from all employees."
good,JetBlue did a fantastic job taking care of their customers. The people I worked with were outstanding.
good,"JetBlue is a great company to work for depending on the position within the company. They really believe in their employees, are great listeners/helpers when you need them, and have strong values."
good,My first job out of college and was a great experience. Worked with a great group of people.
good,Company takes very good care of their employees. Profit sharing and flight benefits really were the key reasons to stay with the company. Crewmembers were friendly and leadership was attentive.
good,I love JetBlue's culture and they truly become a family for you. It is a very fast paced environment and there is lots of learning opportunity. It is highly competitive so I suggest really researching the company so you go in there ahead of the other candidates.
good,"Great company to work for!"
good,Just a great place and people with the usual black sheep’s but a great company to work for and would recommend it as I have in the past to anyone wanting to join JB and it’s culture
good,"Great company to work for, very diverse and respectful. Company has an excellent reputation. Most application windows are filled very quickly. Safety is the number one value!"
good,"I am continually grateful to Jetblue in there efforts to be the best in their category and class of jet travel. They appreciate their employees in a way that many other companies may not. They have assisted me in helping to achieve my goal in flight ratings and certificates, I can now transfer over to the flight operations side of airline travel. I am forever thankful."
good,Great company! Great benefits! Strict uniform policy but worth it! Flight benefits are the best! Management are very supportive. I regret leaving! Schedule swapping option is like no other!
good,Fun work environment......Travel benefit is a plus. Not much growth at the airport. This job is perfect if you are still in school and want to get airline/airport experience.
good,One of the best companies that I have worked for over my career...great place to work and family environment. Great people to work with and take care of their people!
good,A typical day at work all starts with what department you are in and how the morning day starts. For me being apart of the Tech Ops/ Materials team i come in log in to my account and go through my emails from the night before.  I answer any emails that are pertaining to my team and then i get squared away with what is on my task. I believe the hardest part in my day is just getting through the different part numbers i am assigned.
good,"A very forward leaning, fast growth company that is changing and adapting to the ever changing landscape of commercial aviation. The company lives its values and goes out of its way to put people first."
good,"I feel like it is a very good company to work for, but should look into raising the hourly salary considerably for all ground operation workers. I feel the labor does not match the salary at all!"
good,Given the task of gingerly sending revenue customers luggages to their intended destinations. Often required to lead a team of ground operations crew members tasked with delivering the bags of customers within a timely manner. As well as ensuring the safe arrivals and departures of all aircrafts I came in contact with.
good,working at Jetblue is a good place to work. It's a fast pace environment nice people to work with and the job is fun. you learn a lot there different things you can learn working in the bag room working on the plane loading and unloading it's so much you can learn. The hardest thing for me was learning how to use the pushback that helps push the plain out to the runway.
good,"Good company, good people , great job"
good,Great company to work for. Great start being in Reservations and great potential to move to other departments. The company is growing rapidly and there will be a overwhelming amount of opportunities in the near future.
good,"Just love coming in to work not knowing what to expect for the day. It is the same tasks yet the day or the weather can change your day. I learned to be flexible and understanding that travel for some folks can be stressful. So, to make it a most smooth check in process you need to smile and maintain a positive attitude at all times. The most disappointing part is telling a group of passengers that the flight is cancelled. The most enjoyable part is knowing that you did a great job in getting families to their destinations safely and on time."
good,Great learning place for introduction into the airline field. Tech ops expect and demands safety and quality on every task. I would recommend any newbie to the business to hire with JetBlue
good,"This is best company that I have ever worked for! Good benefits, good pay, and the company really looks out after their employees. I have worked for other airlines, but this is by far the best airline to work for. I am very thankful and blessed to work for jetBlue Airways."
good,"Each day you're naturally faced with a few challenges but nothing that can't be handled.  Daily routines make things flow smoothly.  Proper training is provided.  Break rooms are designed to allow you to recuperate and re-energize yourself."
good,"Family atmosphere, great culture, very supportive, volunteer oriented, friendly people, orientation, learning opportunity, travel benefits, open and honest culture."
good,"This is a great company to work for. The culture is relaxed , open, and fun. Innovation and willingness to try new things is the norm here. My only critique would be the lack of a clear career trajectory. It is not consistent across departments. Some departments have very clear paths for career growth, while others have employees that seem to be stuck in some sort of purgatory. Also, the process for reviews has changed several times."
good,great company to work for company really sets them self apart from the pact schedule is based on seniority probation 90days after that very flexible
good,"A typical work day of a Flight Attendant is helping customers receive the best JetBlue service that we can offer them while having fun delivering it."
good,"it was really good experience i loved this contract and my colleges everything was so good environment,culture,employees.i have learned a lot in this project.Young company with a great work environment. Great travel benefits (free flights on jetBlue plus several agreements with other airlines)."
good,Most agents work from home.  I have never felt more valued by a company than I did with JetBlue.  The hardest part of the job is the absolute adhereance to the login rules.
good,"I love my job. As a flight attendant I have been able to see the world, experience different cultures, and become an important part of someone's memorable vaction/flight experience. My job has given me the flexibility to do so much in my personal life such as pursue an education, travel, take language classes, and have a wonderful quality of life."
good,"I love working for this company. It's great. 90% the customers are great, you can make them laugh, have personal conversations, etc. Then there is the 10% of delays, cancellations, people's personalities that really aren't nice for no reason at all. The flexibility is awesome and flight benefits are great. You can definitely try a little bit of everything in one company, most you have to be willing to relocate to, but not a bad thing. All around great place to be."
good,"Overall, JetBlue is an excellent company to work for, with a lot of room for advancement and growth. Pay increases each year through 12 years. I am very happy here."
good,"The flight benefits were a plus. However the lower hourly rate made it so I had to quit to find a higher paying job. "
good,Working at JetBlue airways was a good experience very challenging and competitive I worked as a lead overlooking the entire flight operation working as a group
good,"The pay isn’t much starting out, but it’s a fun environment to be in. Management is awesome. The one thing I said that wasn’t so great is their compliance system, but other than that it’s a good company to be a part of."
good,"Great place to work but you must be flexible. No day is typical.  When I was there management sucked but I understand since I left it has gotten much better."
good,"Ninguna compañía es perfecta y a JetBlue le falta mucho por hacer para llegar a ser lo más cerca a perfecta, pero es una excelente oportunidad de empleo. En P.R. la paga es buenísima y los beneficios son excelentes. No se cansen de aplicar, algún día los llamarán. Éxito!"
good,It is more stressful than people would think. You have to stick your ground and let people know the rules. The job is good for single people without kids or pets
good,"JetBlue is a great company based on the five values: Safety, Caring, Integrity, Passion and Fun; whose mission is to bring Humanity back to air travel."
good,"Good company who seems to really care about their employees welfare.  The benefits are good, training is very good.  It was nice to be able to work from home."
good,"JetBlue is a great company with amazing benefits!"
good,"Jet Blue was a great place to work, it has a great balance of opportunities available. The entire staff is dedicated to safety making"
good,"You generally work from home take reservation calls.  You can trade 2 hours of your shift at a time.  You work a lot if there are snowstorms, even if you are not scheduled to work."
good,Enjoyed working there  i loved the fast paced of arrival flughts and all the duties that came with it for example loading and offloading luggage  greeting people
good,I love working for JETBLUE. One of the best companies I've worked for. They really take care of the employees and the company is fun place to work.  Benefits far exceeds standards
good,"Jetblue is an amazing company in growth which provides a great workplace to work at. Great benefits, such as free flying anywhere it or it's code share airlines fly to, within others. Great if you are into the aviation industry."
good,"Loved running the machines, and loading the airplanes. Always wished the job was longer and paid more. Someone wanted the job more than me. No big deal. I have to pay my dues just like everyone else."
good,"JetBlue Airways is a great place to start a career. Everyday operations at this company is fun and teaches the concept of team work. JetBlue Airways is on the rise: lots of growth, lots of new destinations, and opportunities."
good,"Very fast Paced environment, ability to trade shifts and flexible work schedule good benefits, also travel benefits room for growth. pay not best"
good,Great environment to work in. Would highly recommend the company. And suggest all apply to job they qualify for at JetBlue.
good,"Excellent place to work, staff is amazing. Travel is available for all qualified staff.  The Pilots are very supportive and helpful to Inflight Crew Members.  Training was grueling but necessary and the Trainers were exceptional.  If you have never experienced anything as it relates to Aviation, you must be prepared for an in depth training curriculum."
good,Great place to work. Crewmembers are all great to work with on a daily basis. 24/7 operation requires a lot of attention to detail and making sure all aspects of your job get completed correctly.
good,"Very Professional Company to work for with excellent benefits. "
good,"love this company, fun passiante  and dedicated people work there.  i would recomend this company to anyone with high work values and grow ambitions"
good,the past almost 10 years it has been my second home... I have been able to work with so many people and learn from each and everyone of them.  Family is important and my crewleaders have always made me feel that way. The hardest part is that the commute has been taking a toll and trying to find a job closer to home.
good,I loved working for JetBlue. I started out as a frontline employee and went on to become a supervisor. They are big about promoting from within.
good,"Crew members meet for pre flight qaulifacations. We board our flight making sure that all safety issues are taken care of. If there are any issues a manger is called.  Working  as a team to make sure our customers are taken care of for the duration of the flight. The hardest part of this job is when we have a not normal day (IE... storms, snow hurricanes ). I enjoyed the travel and meeting new people and learning different cultures from all parts of the world."
good,"Since my role was transitioned to the Compensation Department in 2014, I feel that it is not understood what the role involves and how it affects other work groups of the company. While working within a new group has given me a little more transparency of new initiatives that will affect me, there is still a struggle with downward communication, documentation and regard for compliance. I don't feel that adequate knowledge exists in order to support me to do this role more effectively and efficiently and am frequently utilized in inefficient ways as a result. My role involves having a broad knowledge including but not limited to: Securities law, Proxy statement reporting requirements, Accounting practices & compliance, Payroll tax compliance, Income tax implications,  SAP/Payroll & UBS system configuration and causes and effects of data administration…etc., and I feel leadership is solely focused on the equity compensation piece and how it’s presented or packaged  and communicated of which doesn’t directly affect my role of stock administration and equity analyst of our stock plans. I am dedicated to my job and love what I do, the broad knowledge requirements keeps me intrigued and in love with my role, and although I work from home, I work longer and harder, always putting in more than 40hrs to ensure completeness of my work and not having engagement from leadership or leadership with the knowledge-base and appreciation for what I do to support me makes it very difficult. Prior to my role being transitioned to Compensation, it was in the Payroll department which closely relates"
good,"Plain and simple, benefits are awsome. Can advance if you put forward a great effort!!"
good,"Great individuals to work with, good benefits, job security, and an excellent support system"
good,"Very active day"
good,Great company with great benefits. Never met a company who goes above and beyond for there employees.
good,"Great benefits, travel opportunity. Advancement opportunity are excellent."
good,Do your job as your told and do it correctly and no issues should arise at the workplace. Work can get monotonous but the people at the workplace make it so special and unique. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unnecessary insolence but that occurs once in a blue which makes the job very enjoyable.
good,I took inbound calls from customers and made travel arrangements and answered any questions on costs and flight information. Took payments and gave great customer service.
good,"I love my job. I have no complaints besides scheduling. However as a flight attendant, working every holiday and weekend is expected until you have enough seniority to hold the schedule of your choice"
good,"I come to work 50 minutes prior, meet my crew do my pre flight checks and get ready to start my trip. The most enjoyable part of my day is customer service making sure all my customers have the best experience."
good,"I've always loved working at JetBlue. Great culture, great people. It's a work hard, play hard environment. Highly recommend this company. The flight benefits are a huge plus as well."
good,"Jetblue was & still is my heart and soul! I was honored to work for such a great company. They gave me an opportunity of a lifetime!! I am currently a former employee - fully retired from the company as of a few months ago. I worked there for nearly 12 years at the hub JFK. You may read diverse reviews about JETBLUE, but as all things being equal, it comes down to your individual work ethic. If your ready, willing, and fully able to put in a good days work, the company will love you back ten times more! Leadership are respectful, considerable, responsible, and caring! Every concern will be addressed & taken seriously. What YOU put forth into the company, will be exactly what you will be given, so expect the very best. Never had any doubts in regards to leadership, and my fellow crewmembers - each were incredibly kind and respectful. I adored my role as Ground Operations, and I am still melancholy for all my fabulous years with Jetblue. Just be aware, crewmembers make it a great company, and leadership supports that in each interaction. So very proud to say (even still) - I AM JETBLUE!!!!💙"
good,Really a fun and engaging place to work. Willing to teach employees to help them grow and to promote from within as much as possible. Great benefits and perks.
good,I enjoyed working with everyone. They were really helpful. I learned a lot about A320 and ERJ. It was tough at times in bad weather but we pulled together every night to ensure safety and compliance.
good,I loved working for Jetblue airways. The experience working the Ground Operation was like working with family. A very well respected group of people working together to ensure a safe environment.
good,Being a flight attendant is a very stressful job in itself.  This position is for someone who is single with no kids.  You are away from your family most of the time.  Starting off you only get 12 days off a month and if you don't live in base you get less than that because u commute on your days off. But on a brigher note Jetblue itself is an amazing company to work for. I love daughter culture and their product.  I love m job but right now i'm not spending enough time with my daughter.
good,"Good place to work because you work from home,  hours are flexible, however can be hard because it’s very easy to get rid of the Hours.  Love the fact you’re able to travel anywhere they fly.  They have great values that they live by on a daily basis.  I just need a change of pace.  I’ve always worked in an office environment my kids are older now and I know I’m ready to get back out"
good,"A typical day at work is unpredictable and usually fast paced. "
good,"See my previous entry for this company.  They take care of their people. They pay decently and there are great perks, like free airline travel.  That part is the best."
good,i love working for jetblue is a very culture environment place to work in. the benefits are great. the crew members are like family and. everyday is a learning experience.
good,"Great Company, straightforward and great schedule flexibility. The ability to travel makes it a good company to work for. The only issue would be working on the ground and having to deal with bad weather."
good,"Each day at work I would learn something new.  All co-workers work well together. The five core values are always highly maintained and "
good,"JetBlue has been great to me and I've been fortunate to be a part of something special over the past 13 plus years.  JetBlue has matured incredibly over the years - from the people to the place to the processes to the benefits.  I've learned an incredible amount about the airline industry but more about how to successfully deliver projects, lead teams, and improve on all I do.  Most people at JetBlue are hardworking and passionate about the company.  They are the ones who make it difficult to even consider looking elsewhere.  However, the most challenging aspect I face day-to-day is keeping up with operational issues while pursuing to deliver new products or enhance current functionality on existing ones.  I truly enjoy delivery more than operations support and wish to focus my time in that area."
good,This company has a primary focus on it's Crewmembers and Customers. They focus on delivering an excellent experience for both and help you feel like you apart of something greater.
good,If you love to travel and help customers then this is the place for you.  Always something new to see and do.  The airline industry is the best  place to be if you love to travel.
good,"Excellent internship program! Weekly lunch-n-learns, and sounded like there would be an opportunity to return full-time when done with school. Overall, bright, cheerful employees. Flight benefits!"
good,"extended my inventory skills, fun group of people to work with. It's always live never a dull day"
good,"Working for Jetblue Airways was a great experience that provided me a lot of respect for what it means to be a ticket/ gate agent in a busy airport.  In the short six months I worked there I became aware of just how important it was to be efficient in getting customers in and out of the check-in line while dealing with what ever distractions or turn of events may come.  A typical scheduled day of wk consisted of my co workers and I setting up the ticket counter or prepping to work the gate by 4:30 am so that everything including our outbound flights could run smoothly by 6:00am. And from that time on I would usually continue to wk flights or the ticket counter until my shift ended for the day.  The managers at Jetblue were very helpful in making sure they helped relate any updated information about flights to us employees so that we could better assist our customers no matter the circumstance, but if and when weather or maintenance delays prevented on time departures of our flights it was hard to keep the customers from getting upset.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction I had with the many customers I met and getting to know their likes, dislikes and being able to help put a smile on their faces."
good,Great place to work. Flight benefits are unbelievable and my Managers were knowledgeable and approachable.
good,I can genuinely say that my career at JetBlue has let me to places i never imagined.  There are plenty of opportunities to expand my skills and own my projects.  Leadership is engaging and encourages feedback and open discussion.
good,"I loved the benefits at this job."
good,"I joined Jetblue in early 2011, and so far, it has been an honor to work here. Its my first airline and I've had the opportunity to work with great crewmembers as well as learn a great deal about the industry. The perks are by far the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I love working with customers and other employees trying to resolve and help others concerns and compliments!!
good,A typical day - LiveTV is a relatively young company which means much opportunity for growth and improvement. A typical day at work outside of regular meetings would include interacting with internal and external stakeholders to scope features that improve the customer experience usually by improving availability of the product on the aircraft.
good,Would recommend this company to anyone who will listen. They are one giant family. There will never be a job that I have enjoyed more. Currently returning to the company.
good,Excellent place to develop into higher roles.  The benefits and care from the company towards the employees is far beyond expectations.   You will not find another company so open minded and culturally diverse anywhere else.   I'm glad I took a chance with this company after I had closed three companies during my career.
good,"Typically great place to work with and flexibility in schedule,  allows you to travel and swap hours if you want to plan a trip with your family and friends."
good,"Seriously the greatest company I’ve worked for to date! Your flight benefits start immediately (though I’d recommend to wait until after your 90 day probation to be somewhere for more than 1 day). Learning the process can take at least a month before you’re truly comfortable with it if you’ve never had a similar job before, but it’s SO easy and worth any negatives to the job such as upset customers, etc."
good,A typical work day starts with team meeting and briefing follow by assignments. The hardest part of the job is meeting customers' needs doing irregular operations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team.
good,"I began working for JetBlue in May of 2011 as a Reservations agent working from home. I quickly had the opportunity to promote and build a career with them, within two years I joined the Human Resource Team. I had the opportunity to travel to our main office in New York monthly and to our training center in Orlando at least four times a year. I learned various skills and had the support of my leaders to grow my talent. I became a trustworthy Crewmember who was known and seek by others to manage their human resources questions and concerns. "
good,"Love the culture, crew members , benefits, company. I miss being a part of the JETBLUE culture. People genuinely care about you and it was mostly fun and exciting working for such an amazing company."
good,"JetBlue is a very fast pace, demanding company to work for. They demand quality work and deliver on their promise for exceptional customer service. It is fast paced and physically demanding."
good,"I started as a seasonal employee, got hired permanently. It is the best job I ever had, it is very flexible, people are very nice, it really is a lifestyle, excellent if you like traveling and are customer service oriented. The training at the beginning was a little stressing, but that was due to my lack of knowledge and experience in this industry."
good,"I love my job at JetBlue, but it requires me to be on my feet a lot and away from home every week.  I'd like something closer to home and not quite as physical."
good,"Helped customers resolve problems with flights or seating."
good,"Engaging and helpful management and culture made it very easy to get started. Great benefits for full time employees including free flights. Interviewed for full time position, so opportunity for advancement was graciously provided."
good,I enjoy working for JetBlue. They company truly cares about their employees. Benefits are good and very flexible hours with the option to trade shifts.
good,Great people at all levels of the company joining JetBlue is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time. I have worked at JetBlue for 1 years and no 2 projects are alike. Coming to work is fun and there are always nights out and something for everyone. Employees are well compensated in addition to weekly pay. Vast room for advancement due to company growth around the world.
good,"Use of MINT Scheduling software, Crew Trac and Crew Qual to ensure pilots and instructors remained qualified to fly aircraft and training.  Scheduled pilot training in Campus Simulators.  Built instructor schedules."
good,"Great Company to work for. Managers are fair and culture is great!  I love working here and recommend it. Working from home is a plus. Other than the pay not being fair or competitive, this is a good job."
good,"I love my job at jetBlue as a bilingual reservations crew member. I think it is a great job that really let's you be in charge of your hours, in the sense that you can trade easily with other crew members and take VTO (voluntary time off). I love the flexibility! The flight benefits of course are great. It's a great opportunity for the employees to enjoy vacation time with their families at a great price... Free! (Well, for the flights at least!) I love that we can work from home. That also makes this job so great and convenient. I would say that the one thing I don't like about this job is that you do have to live within a certain proximity of the call centers located in Salt Lake City, UT and Orlando, FL. I am looking to relocate to another part of the state to live closer to family and I wish I could keep working with jetBlue, but unfortunately it would be out of proximity! I would love to stay with jetBlue for years and years if it weren't for that. I love the company! I would recommend this job to anyone!"
good,"This is a great company to work for.  A fun place where everyday is a new challenge.  If your eager to learn, to become a leader, to try new opportunities and hungry to grow.  You will have the opportunity to become successful as long as you are willing to work hard.  I enjoy what I do."
good,"The culture at JetBlue is what drives the company's success.  Its 5 Values are embedded in every decision, every action that is taken and has proven to be a winning approach.  Working there is more than just a job.  With its wide impact on the community through volunteerism, JetBlue creates an environment where front line Crewmembers can have a meaningful impact on things that shape the direction of the company and the community.  Its a fun and rewarding place to work"
good,JetBlue was truly one of the best companies I have worked for. I enjoyed my tenure and learned a great deal working there. I loved the culture the company offered and how everyone I met enjoyed their job; they always did their job with a big smile.
good,"Jetblue is a great company to work for.  They have a heart of gold in which they show to their employees and customers.  The pay is great and competitive which is a plus.  Some times the hours get to you but thats part of the job.  Senior leadership is great, very supportive of their employees."
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever held. I enjoyed my 13 years at JetBlue and although I never try to look back, I must admit I miss this one tremendously. Management at all levels always made sure that all crewmembers were empowered by ensuring constant training and support was always available. Opportunities to grow within the company was supported with mentorship and shadowing programs for those with a vision and the desire to succeed."
good,"fast past environment, always a challenge. loved the challenge and learning experience. always a place to move forward constantly training and teaching you new things."
good,"- A typical work day is encountering and assisting multiple customers with different situations regarding there travel arrangements. "
good,"It was always a pleasure to come into work. Everyone was friendly and you were treated with respect"
good,Workplace and crew members always willing to help customers and each other.  Company in general very caring with employees.
good,Fun work place and no day is similar to the previous day. As it turns out the possibilities of advancement are very limited as it is a very small company. Growth is too slow.
good,Never a dull day. Overall a good company to work for. Always looking for ways to Improve customer service and provide tools to do so.
good,Working at JetBlue at their beginning stages was exciting.  Worked with great people and it was nice to see everyone striving to put out their best work.
good,"A typical work day starts with security checks, which is searching for any prohibited items that will damage the plane or put the customer in danger.  what I learn working for JetBlue is that in order to get the job done correctly and efficiently is by team work. When a day becomes short staffed, supervisors would come and help, they are also welling to listen to comments and concerns. what I enjoy the most about working at JetBlue is that I love planes and I love working on them. Every part of my position I consider important, because it contributes to the company growth and customer satisfactions."
good,"it is the best job in the world!!!!!! A typical work day is just like a normal work day. Everyday it is a new adventure. I love all my customers and co-workers. This is my first airline job and I am hooked on it. My worst fear is to fail. But I do not plan to give up. there are days when I ask myself how and why am I here but I never FELT THIS GREAT ABOUT ANY JOB I EVER WORKED. THIS IS LIKE THE GREATEST JOB EVER. I HAVE SOME HARD DAYS BUT THOSE SAME HARD DAYS MAKE ME BECOME STRONGER. THAN I HAVE EASY DAYS. THE PAY IS GOOD AND THEY GIVE YOU GREAT BENEFITS. EVERYONE RESPECTS EVERYONE. "

good,"Clock in and load bags into bin"
good,"JetBlue's Corporate culture is awesome. I am very thankful that I had the chance to work for them. It was sad for me to leave this job, but the red-eye hours where taking a toll on my health because I was working a a Pastor also. "
good,"the job was so great that i couldn't believe they were paying me to be there. If i lived closer, would have came in and hang with my co workers on my days off if i had the time. It was a 2 hour commute from home via mass transit and i never had any complaints about it. I loved that job."
good,"* I would get to the airport and make my way to the gate."

good,Great values and great people. I was happy to go to work everyday.

good,My shift was 8:30-5 i would come in work 3 possibly 4 flights. I learned about time management I enhanced my customer service skills. I learned to always give options. Eliminate the words no don’t won’t or can’t. The hardest part of the job was the best part of the job. Working on a team outside in the elements
good,JetBlue is the best Airline to work for and to fly on.  I worked as a crew support member and I learned many great habits to take care of customers.  JetBlue cares deeply about their customers and went out of their way to take care of the employees so that in return the employees took care of the customers.  It was a win win for everyone specially the customer.
good,"Jetblue was a fantastic place to work.  Management was easy to get along with and the pay was excellent.  The hardest part of the job was occasional long days with annoyed passengers.  However, the travel was awesome.  Jetblue works hard at fostering a culture of fun at work."
good,JetBlue is a great company to work for. The company not only cares about their customers but their employees as well. I am proud to work for JetBlue and will continue to succeed through the company.

Check customers in, secure flight by reviewing authentic credentials, reserve flights, make accommodations, handle baggage with care, provide proper ticketing and tags to customers, while keeping an upbeat, positive and friendly personality. "

good,If you know someone who works at JetBlue you have an in with them. It's a constant flow of calls from the 800 number and there's always someone in the queue. There are opportunities to move up quickly. I would have stayed at the job had I not been offered a higher paying position elsewhere. Best culture in the airline industry.

Whether it is overcoming a mothers fear about her child flying unaccompanied or helping to escort a late comer to the gate so they do make the flight. I enjoy helping in anyway and do everthing I can to make the customers experience the best experience I can.
good,"Everday working at JetBlue was different even though the tasks performed where the same, the environment was fast paced, at times it could be challenging. You have to be aware of your surroundings at all times because there is traffic on the ramp and not just airplanes. You are on a team that prepares the ramp for the arrival of the aircraft, meets the plane when it lands, off loads the baggage and at times, cargo. You the service the aircraft with water, hook up the airconditioner, communicate with the Captain the amount of baggage going on and where it is being loaded, the amount of fuel being administered as well as the amount of cargo if any. All this is done within a certain amount of time and done according to all FAA rules and regulations. There are times when you are working in extreme heat, rain and depending on what part of the country you are in, snow. You also may be driving beltloaders, tugs and/or the pushback which moves the aircraft. You get certified to perform most of the duties performed on the ramp and there are continuos training classes that are mandatory every month to keep you updated on things that may have changed or that have been added. For me one of the things I enjoyed most was the company really did invest in their employees."
