rating,review
bad,"I was working through agency doing machine technician, 40 hour a week and they don't treat there temps with the respect they Deserve. I made the best of it for the time being."
bad,Hasbro does not hire from within and they make it IMPOSSIBLE to advance ... management is so unempathetic... I spent almost half my life working there just to get used.
bad,"Industry is declining, so it might be best to find employment elsewhere. Management is basically only out for itself and it's own personal profit, with little concern for employees."
bad,"Pros: If you are a sadistic megalomaniac, you will go far at this company, with the full support of management, human resources and legal."
bad,"Company left to China. They paid their Chinese workers 2 dllrs. for 6 hrs. of work and 2 dollars for six more hrs. of work in the afternoon.  They had their workers working in flip flops instead of steal toe shoes, and all Osha rules were out the window. They left us without jobs because of the lure of bigger profit margins."
bad,"Read the book by Wayne Miller, Toy Wars: The Epic Struggle Between G.I.Joe, Barbie and the Companies Who Make Them."
bad,"If you are a contract employee and get sexually assaulted by another employee, they will hire that white male FT and then make life difficult for you. "
bad,"Incompetent manager.  When I asked how to do something, the standard response was see how it was done previously.  The person who did my job before me was not too bright so there were a lot of mistakes.  I did not find out until the CEO pointed it out.  You were constantly told you are a valuable employee until all of a sudden you are not.  I really wanted to go back to my old job there, but to no avail."
bad,"Empresa de brinquedos importada, montava vitrines e fazia abastecimentos em Shoppings e Supermercados"
bad,Everything goes downhill. Including management who will pass the buck to its employees.
bad,I learned what it is like to be an expendable faceless employee.
bad,el centro donde labore me brindaron todo el conocimiento y el aprendijaque que puede tener el promotor de ventas al momento de ofrecer el producto y la facilidad del consumidor de comprar el juguete que sera para el niño.
bad,Mucho favoritismo y mal manejo de recursos humanos
bad,"It's a place to put in a few years to gain experience and leave.  Unfortunately this isn't a family company and everything is tied to shareholders, so layoffs are frequent with minimal chance for move-up in career path. Ideally, great place to make contacts via licensing and trade show to make the next move. With lack of competence in middle management, most teams are left to fend for themselves with constant churn/changes to mediocre product offering. If it wasn't for big licenses, not sure what Hasbro would do."
bad,"work you to the bone, time you, and try to control every second of your time. you must be a robot to work here."
bad,horaires de travail et travail intéréssant mais pas tjrs bon esprit d équipe entre salariés et aucune possibilitée d évoluer au sein de l entreprise concernée.
bad,"- Bitter staff"
bad,"• Extremely dysfunctional company that continually makes poor business decisions and refuses to listen to it's core customer base."
bad,Solo dos empleados que ya tienen mucho tiempo no hay superación
bad,"If you LOVE Hasbro's brands, believe in the power of play, and want to be around incredibly creative and passionate people, Hasbro is the place for you."
bad,"Employee dress code should be better presentable & enforced by Human Resources and its not. Tight skin jeans/ or leggings with heels not very professional especially in the dress code in Narragansett Park Drive, Pawtucket. Employees spend more time talking away from there desks with coworkers-very laid back environment. Communication is none from managers during your 30/60 trial and they tell you nothing and give you the boot, and tell staffing services you can not do your job. Managers can not train well nor co-workers they piece mail you information and you don't train for 1 week or 2 with someone rather 3/4 days. Human Resources is absent in all and every aspect of the place, there is only an inquiry line no direct person."
bad,"Vast majority of shop floor workers are agency workers on a little above minimum wage. No sick pay, only one day's notice given of finishing to most workers. "
bad,job was terrible management was off they didn't care about their staff whats so ever always left alone with no instruction or proper training for the job
bad,"For a toy company, they seem to lack a general sense of humor.  They do NOT allow employees free reign of expression.  They do NOT allow their employees to ""cut loose"".  *example: they had a pinball game in the lobby...no one was allowed to play it.  They are absolutely paranoid about security.  You can't even head to the restroom without a security guard keeping track of you and cameras recording your path.  There is zero privacy.  If you want to have a private conversation with your co-workers, you need to leave the building.  Strange.  Strange almost cultish company."
bad,"Hasbro has given up on creating new products. They obsess over making ancient toys and games with lower quality materials and design. Innovation =lower costs, which translates to layoffs of anyone over 4O. Managers and directors are doomed"
bad,Its a tough place to advance your career and explore new avenues in the company.
bad,It was fun alot of nice people sometimes stressfull cuse some jobs was hard but I like it I left cuse I was working for the agency for 3 years never got hierd and it was less pay.
bad,"Nothing much to say, Just another company that feigns compassion for their employees. Take advantage of their benefits and last as long as you can there and then move on to something that will actually fulfill you."
good,was good place to work now you are just a number you don't grow with company take money away
good,"During the Holidays, hours were Full Time, some weeks, more than Full Time. Hours right now are 1 week, 1 day a week;  next week, 2 days a week. Just very inconsistent not knowing when I will have hours to work."
good,"Learnt to switch off when working on the Line."
good,"Hasbro is a company in constant change, every month the system or way to work evolves. Change is great, monthly change is not so great."
good,great work great projects. Getting paid and communicating with their accounting department is a nightmare. Plan on it taking 3+ months to receive payment if you are lucky.
good,"Working for Hasbro is like a typical 8-5 job, with lots of meetings that fill up your day. There are some managers that are good at their job, but there are also some that are very bad at it. I was under a manager who was not good at being a manager. That resulted in my name being one of the candidates of a small restructuring that happened in the company and I was let go. "
good,"No que se refere à Hasbro, a gerência muito cordial e preocupada com o funcionário, o que me passou confiança no trabalho. A empresa terceirizada para a qual prestei serviço para a Hasbro, Tradição deixou um pouco a desejar quanto ao atendimento, pois passava horas na empresa para ser atendida. No mais as empresas possuem pontos positivos."
good,"Overall I found Hasbro to be a highly conservative work place.  There wasn't a lot of diversity at all.  Very white work force, and very homogenous work styles. There is a culture of rewarding loyalty with promotions into positions that people do not necessarily have the background or skills to be effective in their new roles.  "
good,This was an internship while in school.  No pay or benefits.  I was able to work on my production and post-production skills in a professional environment while working on broadcast quality commercial productions
good,"Good benefits, culture needs help. You can be a rock star one day and out the next."
good,Really fun place to work. Development team has been fantastic and super hard working. Some marketers are clueless to toy development and do not seem to care to learn about it either.
good,Was a good company to work for the only downside is that the job is seasonal the staff are good to work with and the company itself gives a lot of benefits
good,"Une belle entreprise avec un beau cadre de travail. Des collègues agréables mais un management global catastrophique.  Aucune reconnaissance ni considération et évolution professionnelle verticale impossible. Conciliation vie privee et professionnelle difficile."
good,"Tive muitos aprendizados na Hasbro. A vaga de marketing onde sempre trabalhei me ofereceu grandes oportunidades de aprendizado em muitos âmbitos do marketing. Trabalhando direto com produtos como forecast por SKU, projetos para aprimorar processos, adaptação e produção de comerciais de TV, organização e gestão de eventos, definição de planos de marca e estratégias de comunicação digital."
good,not much room for advancement in the coompany. shift lead where not well structured. but the overall treatment from employees was good. 25cent raise every year. made us feel less wanted as employees..
good,Fun place to work but seemed like people were in and out all the time and the focus shifted to marketing from design. Lots of great ideas but don't expect them to go anywhere if the narrow mind cant see it.
good,"Only part-time/seasonal work. Great company, great part-time benefits. Management okay. Lots of paperwork and mailings."
good,"Inventory was critical for production.  Making pulls on the computer to keep assembly lines running and troubleshooting happened every day.  Cycle counting was done on spare time and when materials needed to be counted.  Using a forklift was also necessary, as one may have to help locate materials into the warehouse locations or help on TOs when asked by the warehouse supervisor.  But always keep your area clean."
good,It was a learning experience for me to gain knowledge in customer service and management skills and more in depth about sales. It helped me to develop good decision making when came across difficult situation like for example managing or interacting with various types of people personality and character.i had to react any matter in a proffesional approach so as to be fair and just.
good,Good company to work for if you like toys.  People are passionate about delivering products that bring joy to others.  They are flexible with schedules.
good,"Hasbro is great if you have a real love for making toys. Relaxed workplace, overall nice and laid back people. Not competitive and very community oriented."
good,It was a good working for the company and the staff was nice.  The workers would also make you feel welcome to. I think that they make you feel comfortable.
good,"Fui muito feliz nessa ação desde a agencia que me contratou , quanto a empresa e as lojas que atuei encontrei parceria , e bom ambiente de trabalho.Gestão acolhedora ,uma ação rápida e com bom resultado,vendas alcançadas ."
good,Typical day was long and fast paced. I learned a lot about other nationalities and cultures. The hardest part of the job was the layoffs and decreased employee activities/recognition. The best part of the job was that I learned to operate many machines and forklifts as well as manual laboring.
good,"Alinemamiento equipo de trabajo."
good,"Many staff are doing the jobs of several people. Joint ventures in entertainment, especially gaming and television, cause churn in which publicly-espoused corporate goals and results-oriented staff are second to those talking a good game."
good,"Hasbro has great benefits, and great co-workers who will help you out when needed."
good,"Tough environment"
good,Very big company that always works with deadlines in mind. Lots of scheduled meetings daily and not much room for creativity under most brands. Hires lots of contractors.
good,"Conducted store visits to big box retailers.  Utilized hand held devices to check inventory and ensure shelves are full.  "
good,"although i was a temp i did enjoy the job in itself."
good,We would clock in on the finger scanner. Then straight in to the workshop floor to start opening products ready to be stacked on the display units and other jobs included open products from boxes checking that they are packed correctly and that the products are in the right boxes.
good,caring when it come to employee and their family every employee  rewarded for their birthday with a day off with pay. It something that I thought was a very rewarding for each and every employee.
good,"Hasbro is very much a revolving door unless you get a very Senior position. I did enjoy my time there, but the work culture is very at-arms-length in many ways. No one stays for very long."
good,"Really good work / life balance, with the option to leave at 1pm every Friday if you complete your minimum working hours (37.5). Very little professional development."
good,"I held an internship for Hasbro. The person I was completing a project for was hard to reach and provided minimal support/insight. Ultimately, the project failed as a result."
good,"the team leaders are terrible and lazy and will not help you do anything, everyone who works there is lovely and welcoming despite the childish few, the money is awesome but they only recruit threw agency"
good,Good company... looked after staff and had a good staff culture.. They were happy to spend the money on looking after staff which in turn meant the staff efficiency was higher
good,"The high learning curve and additional demands of the position not described during the interview, combined with a somewhat oppressive atmosphere, did not make this an enjoyable position for me."
good,The company had long twelve hour rotation schedule which is unsafe. Management was less noticeable and safety was not top priority.
good,"not good with employees, no team environment, not good with benefits and managers.  No supervisors on hand, bad work environment."
good,Great people to work with. Challenging work with difficult time lines. Total meetings per week is reasonable. Too many temps not enough open req's to accommodate the need.
good,"otimo de se trabalhar alem de premiações por metas, e serviços excelente"
good,Managed web properties in western europe in alignment with US branding and commerce goals. Great production team within larger brand and marketing group. Opportunities for growth.
good,"Fun place to work.  Office space is the best I ever worked in."
good,"This company represents brands that foster community and are built around story-driven entertainment experiences. They create fun, engaging products, and as such, it can be a blast to work here. Management would be wise to look at the impacts of the highly political work environment, starting from the top down."
good,"Vérifier l’approvisionnement du poste de travail en éléments nécessaires à la production, à partir d’instruction ou de fiche"
good,"Part of European IT Management Team that allowed me to gain experience on large project management on the different factors impacting projects (BPR, Management, Budget, etc)"
good,"I was hired to work at Hasbro on a contract basis.  Without going into too much detail, don't work for this company unless you can guarantee FULL TIME/SALARIED employment.  Temps go through a contract agency process and are offered more trouble via paperwork than anything else."
good,"I enjoyed my 8 years at Hasbro. I had wonderful co-workers and enjoyed my time with them. I do not think that the managment has a clue what my job was. For 8 years I recieved great reviews (FE/FE+) , I never once recivied a promotion. Managent was very uninvolved with my department. During my 8 years at Hasbro I had 6 differnt bosses."
good,"Hasbro has an enormous amount of very creative people who work well with each other, however, recent downturns in their profits have sparked several hundred lay offs over the last several years. Some senior managers are visionary and forward thinking - good to their people. Some managers are self-motivated and self -centered. Anyone going to work for them should be sure their manager is one of the good ones."
good,"Company offers great benefits and flexibility. It once was a fun company to work for, the tone has changed due mainly to reduction in sales/profits."
good,"Hasbro's amazing stable of brands should ensure long term success for the company, but it will be a rough road in the foreseeable future.  Great work/life balance, but little opportunities for advancement and little ownership."
good,"Working for Hasbro was a fun job, the people I worked with were team players and we all worked well together.  My job included working on excel spreadsheets for the sales people who sold toys to Kmart Headquarters.  We also worked on setting up planograms with the Kmart buyers.  I really enjoyed seeing the results of our toy sales during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.  My previous advertising experience greatly benefited my job position with Hasbro."
good,É uma empresa que aposta bastante em material de merchandising.
good,"J'ai toujours adoré mon travail, salaire et condition. Depuis un an, nouveau patron et est engager pour couper du personnel."
good,llegar a las tiendas checar el surtido ir a bodega sacar mercancia a piso de venta y acomodar limpieza
good,"Au premier abord l'ancienneté des collègues est rassurante mais on s'aperçoit vite que ce sont des ""survivants"" et également qu'il y a peu d'opportunités de développement"
good,"I provided administrative assistants to fullfill the unique needs of each individual team member of the Research and Development team in both the U.S. and U.K. based offices."
good,"I would roll into work about 7:30am and begin at 8am from then on I would check which department I am working in which was usually the unloading areas. From 8 until 5 a group of us would unload lorries sending boxes down the rollers and stack them in a certain pattern on top of a pallet. Once the pallets were full they would be taken away to be wrapped and we would have to lay out a fresh set of pallets and repeat until the end of the day. The hardest part of the job was the amount of physical work you had to put in for long hours of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was if you had to work in the VAS area where all you had to do was label the toys, much easier on your back and you wouldn't wake up the next day in pain."
good,"Loved working at Hasbro for the people.  The teams usually band together and a lot of hard work and good times.  The company is a 'public company' first and foremost.  This can be great for investors and your 401K, but can make things incredibly tight during tough quarters and really difficult tough years.   It is a great place to be in the good times and super nervous in the difficult times.   Which probably makes it like everywhere else."
good,"Hasbro Canada suffers from the same thing as any Canadian branch of an American company: there is no room for real decision making or significant impacts to the industry - it's all about implementing the US office's plans. This can be stifling as a whole, but the team is very nice and good to work with."
good,"I enjoyed the work/family balance at Hasbro.  My colleagues were very friendly."
good,It's a generally fun place to work. The subject matter is fun and employees seem really happy. There are a lot of family activities and half-day Friday are always appreciated.
good,Excelente empresa y gran ambiente de trabajo entre compañeros
good,it was a good job but very demanding standing up for 8hrs a day
good,"Nice place to work. Very talented, dedicated people. Sometime, they play it a bit too safe. Need more R&D."
good,"As a merchandiser, my job is very physical and fast paced.  It requires being on a ladder and carrying boxes up to 40 lbs. I also communicate with store management regularly."
good,I worked with a team of 12 or more District Managers. The culture of the team was ethical and supportive. We work as one unit the build a effective region of managers.
good,"Fun place to work, great culture, great benefits, position was not the right fit for me."
good,"fue muy ameno el tiempo que estuve en hasbro, no tuve ninguna dificultad al realizar mis deberes. lo único que no me gusto fue que no tenia día de descanso."
good,In hasbro they take really good care of their workers. The security is number one for them. People are nice and they will help you whenever you need it.
good,A typical day at Hasbro was normal. It was the same thing everyday so at one point it got boring. I learned that the company's products had to be right at all times. The rates have been up and down for years but now they are good and the company is doing wonderful. My Co-Workers were so nice. Most of them were older than me. They showed respect at all times and helped me out when I needed it. The hardest part about the job was going into the job at 2:45Pm to 10:45AM in the summer time because when you work in a warehouse it feels like your away from everything. I always felt like I was missing something. The most enjoyable part about working at Hasbro was that I got to see and put together childhood game board games that I haven't seen or played in years.
good,"My work day consisted of delivering and processing mail and shipping.  I would set up room for special events as needed and run the product room for the employees.  I learned that you should always be kissing your bosses behind if you want to keep your job.  The boss I had put me on a performance improvement plan in January for such things as crossing my arms during team meetings,  coming in to work to early and not answering e-mails to him and his crony fast enough.  When I successfully completed the PIP he eliminated my job title, renamed it from mail room clerk and called it Facilities assistant and gave the job to one of his friends."
good,"Work with Supervisor as a surge employee."
good,"Tienen grandes marcas y la empresa es una buena empresa en la que trabajar, cuidan a sus trabajadores y la remuneración es buena. Sin embargo, falta gestión estratégica y visión de futuro."
good,"Intérimaire préparatrice de commande."
good,"I found that Hasbro was an interesting company to work for but i felt under utilised and finding work became just as much a workload as actually doing the work itself."
good,"très peu de choses a dire sur cet entreprise . dans l’ensemble correcte, trop de petit contrat travaille sasser facile dans l’ensemble ,pas d’embauche ."
good,"Excellent immediate manager, duties evolved over the years resulting in excellent growth, however the division did not promote based on performance. "
good,° Bonne entente entre les embauchés et les intérimaire.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo relajado, se aprende a tratar con el cliente de manera amable."
good,"The workplace was very competitive and there was a lot of office politics to navigate. However, the teams were supportive and generally the environment was friendly."
good,"Too many layoffs, and workers left are overwhelmed.."
good,"Le cadre de travail était agréable, l'ambiance sympathique, mais malheureusement aucune évolution possible, contrats trop courts (2 semaines avec un allongement d'une semaine en général) peu probable de faire un mois complet ce qui est bien dommage même si la paie était intéressante, aucun avenir envisageable."
good,"It was a pleasure to walk into work everyday when I worked at Hasbro.  What I loved most about my job was that every day there was something different to do in my position.  Of course, I had my regular daily duties, but there was always an ad hoc request that changed my duties up a bit."
good,Good Cmpany to work for. Have 1/2 day Friday. Hasbro is a company that does alot in its community and I like that.
good,"Good environment, and culture. But not good for those want to work more than one year, cause most of their contract are Temp. After one year you have to wait at least 6 months to be eligible to rehire."
good,"I love Hasbro and it is full of talented hard working people. The idea generation and creativity is astounding among the doers, but it lacks the proper management and decision making to empower them. Bad management is often rewarded at the expense of talent."
good,"*decent work place"
good,a great place to work and a great company they showed you everything. went to different location. and it was great working with the store. great place to go home
good,"This was my first internship, so the corporate structure was a bit of a shock as it was a toy company. Looking back, however, there was definitely alot of awesome opportunities. Maybe not a place I would stay for a long time, but a cool experience nonetheless."
good,"Very good enviroment to work, fun and enjoyable."
good,"Hasbro can be great company to work for.  They produce some of the most recognizable brands in the industry, and are always looking for the next big thing."
good,"Hasbro is a nice place to work. They have a lot to offer, and good benefits. They have a nice job culture too. Some of their management could use some room for improvement."
good,"A great place to work with creative minds. A lax work environment, many slow days followed by bursts of busy periods. Encouraged to be creative. Involved with surrounding community."
good,Hasbro was a great place to work. The company culture and values are all about creating fun experiences for children. I had fun planning events and be a part of various projects.
good,One of the best companies to work for in RI.  Toy company made it fun place to work.  Gave you all the tools necessary to succeed and do your job well.
good,Overall experience was wonderful. Very nice company to work for. Learned  a lot from fellow peers and training was impecable. Everyone is out to help one another. hAS GOOD WORK MORAL THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.
good,The company is a awesome place to work. If I did not need to move I would still work there. They pay you on time and they treat you with respect. The salary is also not that bad as well.
good,"Hasbro is a great company with a fun culture and fantastic people.  In fact, its the people are what make Hasbro so special."
good,"Start at 8am get assigned a place in the production line be efficient in product placement on the assembly line while working on my own and within a team. I learned about good teamwork, working on my own and efficient work schedules and targets. Meeting new people (co-workers and management) and working was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"de bons collaborateurs"
good,"Geen dag was het zelfde met alle verschillende werkzaamheden."
good,una empresa la cual me dio la oportunidad de trabajar con ellos en la temporada de navidad en donde me brindaron su apoyo y estaban muy pendiente del trabajador que no nos faltara nada y el ambiente laboral era muy bueno con los demas mercaderistas y con los jefes en donde trabajabamos 8 horas diarias de domingo a domingo sin descanso por la temporada en la que nos encontrabamos aprendi hacer mas activo de lo que soy a relacionarme mas con ls personas y con los clientes me costo un poco ser mas tolerante pero a medida que ivan pasando los dias aprendi hacer tolerante con las personas
good,"typical day •	Verify receipt of all packing slips and materials against delivery and post goods receipts"
good,"Llegaba a diario a acomodar la mercancia,limpiarla,y organizar los precios,y arealizar labor de venta,aprendi a ser mejor en ofrecer el producto y mas rapido,mis jefes , estaban muy contentos por mis logros y por el beneficio para la empresa,mis colegas buenas personas nos apoyavamos en lo requerido para mejorar el trabajo,y lo que mas me gusto del trabajo que era buen ambiente laboral y buena paga,lo dificil que solo fue por un mes porque la temporada termino muy pronto."

good,"Hasbro is a good company, the days are long and but if you put in the time you can get ahead, there's plenty of good people who are willing to help you grow with in the company."
good,"Absolutely one of my favorite jobs.  Unfortunately, as a contract position it doesn't matter how hard you work or your contribution to the team, they cannot keep you once your contract ends."
good,"Most management members in IT area are smart, nice and hard working. Like all organizations, some managers were not great communicators. Generally a good place to work."
good,"Travail répétitif, travail saisonnier"
good,"Experience tres enrichissante."
good,Typical day included unpacking stock and supplying line. Management were consistently monitoring our duties.  Co-workers were extremely friendly.  The hardest part of the job was constantly having to stand up and most enjoyable part was the great colleagues
good,I supported end users with computer issues via phone and remote access with Bomgar.  I also performed exchange administrative duties such as adding and removing computer access and setting password changes.  I was also in charge of set up and support of remote access.  I enjoyed working with my team.  I especially enjoyed taking part of the Partnership for Profit project team and would have loved to do more of that.  My least favorite part of working for Hasbro was that they did not promote from within.
good,"I had the absolute privilege to work with offices around the world to update their products each day. The teamwork and structure were there. It was a fun place to work. There was never a dull day. "

good,"Working for a toy company can be very rewarding. Hasbro has a great corporate culture of community engagement, volunteerism and investment in its employees. "

good,"Leuk bedrijf, prima locatie, gezellige collega's en actuele producten."
good,"Hasbro has made moves over the years to make itself a leader in the toy industry. They continue to secure top franchises and expand. As a retail merchandiser, it was my job to ensure our products and features were all set at each location. I had an excellent manager who encouraged and assisted in ensuring my success. Across several industries and other work experience, I still find some of the best leadership having come from this organization."

good,"Who doesn't want to play with toys all day?!"

good,"At any point in my day I am on the phone or emailing with someone overseas. I am the primary contact for our Western European sites so I interact daily with co-workers in France, Germany, UK, Belgium, Italy, etc. I've learned to market globally rather then think US only. Our team has gone through many changes in the last two years, from management changes to work related changes. The digital team was a production team, we added content to websites and launched them. Now we are a digital marketing team, we are moving away from loading content and focusing more on what content should be created."

Log into vendor log, then go to the toy department to find the department manager and discuss what I would do in this store for today. After a walk-thru I would scan empty peg hooks or empty slots on shelves for my product and proceed to the back stockroom to scan out products from the bins. After taking product to the floor and putting it out, I would clean up my mess, show the department manager what I had accomplished, have department manager sign my vendor log and head to my next store."

good,"Great place to work, with good compensation and environment, but heavily relying on contract and temp workers makes it difficult to gain permanent positions in creative services. This ""revolving door"" of temp workers means that a lot of talented people pass through and are lost, and much time is pent getting new temps up to speed and proficient at their jobs only to be replaced again."
good,"Conducting an internship in the german office of Hasbro Toy Company offered me the ability to learn more about the toy industry, and get an inside look at the functions of a multinational corporation, especially within a marketing context. The most difficult part of the job was the language barrier, and trusting in myself to ask for help when taking on new projects. The most enjoyable part of the job was undoubtedly the coworkers I had the pleasure of working with, and the fun, relaxed culture of the company."

good,Hasbro takes into account that you have a life outside of work.
good,"Hasbro uk is a fantastic place to work because of the culture, people and professionalism, Hasbro UK is now a small development site from its former days, however the extent of knowledge and historic skill base means that through its ever decreasing size it relies on a few to know and do alot.. As most senior management are now US based ,the character of this unique site is not fully understood, this can be a little frustrating, but on the whole, its a fun dynamic place to work. Hasbro is enjoyable experience because of the fun atmosphere and the great product portfolio."

good,"I would return to this company in a heart beat! The managers are helpful, everyone is helpful actually! Made me actually look forward to coming into work. How many people can actually say that they look forward to coming into work?"
good,Práce je sice dobře placená ale stát 8 hodin na stejném místě je proste nic moc
good,Hasbro is a great company to work for. Great benefits and half day Fridays.  Senior management clearly care about their employees and there are opportunities to learn about other department but tough to actually get a permanent position.

The pay is wonderful! I have learned over the years where every toy in walmart is. The hardest part would be finding my product and making sure it was represented in the correct area.I enjoy setting up the displays and making my product look good to consumers. I do get to work with my mother, who is full time year round, which is great and lucky. We have so much fun working together. We both have strong work ethics, so its great when we can see how well we have done at the end of our day. I love doing merchandising and Im very good at it. I understand all that goes into the marketing of our products."

Since you'll be working on toys or games it's a guarantee that at least part of you day will be fun, whether it's testing out a new game or reviewing the newest toys or walking down ""Main Street"" and seeing the new innovations and toy lines coming out. Half day Fridays means you'll always have time to get your errands done without sacrificing work time. An on-site gym means you don't have to pay for a gym membership, though most gyms in the area offer good discounts for employees."
good,"I was a temp employee for one year with the company. Everyone is great and they really help you develop. Can't say enough about this company. Had it not been for a contract, I would have stayed there."

good,"Hasbro does a great job balancing its commitments to its different stakeholders -- for a publicly traded company, a delightfully surprising amount of the conversation is about how to deliver the most value to consumers and how to be a great partner to suppliers, customers, its employees, and the environment. "
good,"great to work there, as I was there as a temp.. I was enjoying it more than anyone, I proved that the line was able to work faster by reducing the amount of people on a line (filling in game boxes), due to that I was moved many times around the factory as I was proving too efficient for the line.  It was good as I was rewarded a bonus every week as I was doing more than 1 duty.  I was then showing the dispatch guy a faster and more effective way of loading the boxes onto the trucks!"
good,Picking stock to go out tho shops like argos and amazon ect plus we have to pick off hand held scanners and also making sure no damage stock went out .
good,Fun work place. Honor and trust system. No supervisor looking over your shoulder. lots of heavy lifting and climbing ladders.You work with a diverse group of people in various toy stores. No opportunities for advancement.
good,"As an intern, depending on the team you're on, you have a fairly busy day with work that feels actually important and is. The RI offices are great, as are the people in them. Management is a bit slow to change and advancement is a matter of timing as positions are constantly rotating through contracts. Interns aren't always kept in the loop, but overall the environment is fantastic, with some of the smartest people I've met."

good,"I was a model for a board game shoot. The job involved me having many shots taken of me in a family scenario where we were playing a board game. I learned a lot of key model shots, friendly atmosphere from management and everything was tightly run. The hardest part was all of the wardrobe changes and the amount of time we were on set. Being placed onto the cover of a board game."
good,I found Hasbro to be a wonderful community of talented and enlightened people. I took great pride in my time there. I would recommend Hasbro to anyone who may be considering a position there.
good,Buena empresa. Pagos al día. Con solución de problemas del trabajador

good,"On orientation day, I met an older gentleman, who said he worked at Hasbro 20 years ago and had been trying to find his way back to Hasbro ever since."
good,Excellent company with an exceptional CEO that is poised for long term growth.  They spend money and time developing their leaders  which is becoming more rare with each passing year.  The fact that many employees have worked more than 30 years and that they have proven they can attract and motivate a broad array of talent is impressive.
good,"très bon salaire"
good,I loved working at Hasbro great staff. Loved everything about it. People were nice always stayed busy. They have a gym. They have family activities on the weekend like soap box durby. Loved that job.
good,"Excelente trabajo, capacitación constante, buen trato y pagos."

good,The workload was fulfilling. Working with a great group of people made every day enjoyable and motivated us to help the team in any way possible.

good,"The vision to take the company forward in an ever-changing retail environment is strong."
good,"Hasbro was such an amazing place to work. People were very passionate about the work that they did, and I was able to work with some amazing people. Hasbro is such an iconic brand, and even during career fair events, the enthusiasm and passion that came from job seekers as they reminisced about toys they played with as children, made me proud to be a part of an organization such as Hasbro. Don't only think of Hasbro as a brand that you buy toys for your children or you go to watch the movies, but also think of Hasbro as an employer of choice. Believe me, you'd be working with some amazing people!"
good,"I was only a temporary employee there, but they were a wonderful company to work for. they gave us a snow day and were very understanding of the limitations of their employees."

good,Una empresa muy buena y mucho apoyo de los supervisores como del área administrativa
good,"During my time working for Hasbro, i have developed skills both hands on and on the computer. My team has been supportive the whole way and helped me gain experience in a highly demanding field. Many projects are coming in and out everyday where we need to keep track of all parts to ensure our customers are getting the proper times requested. I have been able to manage my time well here and learn programs such as magics, preform, and illustrator. Hasbro has also helped me apply my hands-on schooling at Wentworth to put together and fix items needed for customers whether it is for a photo shoot, tooling had copy, or paint samples."
good,Bonne entreprise. On bouge beaucoup. Le personnel est sympa
good,"For the most part my years at Hasbro were very good ones.  I started out in an entry level position, however I was given the opportunity to grow professionally and was lucky enough to have had managers who encouraged me to reach outside of my comfort level in order to assist me with reaching my career goals."
good,I worked on a short-term contract with Hasbro. Each member was passionate about their work which only inspired others to do the same. The staff were fun and light-hearted but focused. This lead to a very enjoyable time working for a great company.

good,How bad can a day be when you work with toys and games.  I was a territory representative and covered 2 states.  My job was fun and I traveled a lot.  I worked alone and did not meet other workers more than once per year when we would go to New York for toy market.  Mostly enjoyed demonstrating how the toys or games worked when helping in my local accounts during Christmas.
good,"I believe Hasbro is very good to their employees offering many advances, education, involvement with the company, and just knowing the administration listened to you and cared about your welfare was a great thing. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and meeting new and different people and the opportunity to better myself in the manufacturing industry."

good,I was only an intern but it was such an amazing experience working/studying there.
good,"Everyone is welcoming, nice and helpful. I was trusted by my manager and mentor to take on a project alone. A lot of concepts and ideas come and go so quickly in the toy industry, my product was never released but I learned so much working on it getting help from so many coworkers from all different departments. Ideas are always encouraged no matter how crazy or impossible, you never know how they might make it possible to accomplish!  Day to day was always different, but always creative and fun. I learned every step of the toy designing process from concept to finished product."
