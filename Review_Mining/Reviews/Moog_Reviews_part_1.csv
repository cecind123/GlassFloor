rating,review
bad,I’ve never been treated so badly in my life. I felt threatened most of the time.and my coach was a joke. He let others tell him what to do. Employees didn’t follow directions with chemicals.
bad,"If you want a hostel environment look no further than this company. Broken promises, and to be put down at every chance they can get. Main manager will talk behind your back and then 10 feet away and make sure you heard every negative word. She doesn't listen when you're wanting to move up. And will yell in your face if things don't work out for her favor. Lots of favortizum and inappropriate behavior going on."
bad,"The manager at the time that i was working there did not have a background in aerospace but in the automotive industry. He was a pompous, miserable little man that made the work place very toxic. All the other managers and leads were also toxic, always trying to find a way to back stab one another for brownie points. Some of the people were toxic. It's honestly a great place to learn and get your feet wet but you'd really need to watch out for who you associate with and how they judge you. Favoritism is very apparent in this company. My supervisor had mood swings and was also a very toxic person."
bad,"Moog was stuck in the 1960's where men dominated everything. It was the first time I ever experienced that kind of gender divide, women were mostly held positions as assistants or in HR. It was like going back in time. I was also in a contract position and made to feel unimportant and like I didn't matter. For example, when they had their company picnic, contract employees were invited, but had to pay, the regular employees did not. Since most didn't want to pay, they'd stay behind and work."
bad,"There is a big gap between the documented culture by Mr. Moog and the Culture on the ground. Managements drives the company in a ""Middle ages"" culture and they don't aware that there is a ""Systematic Thinking"" that have been used to lead the companies to the ""Word Class"" level. They even don't know that Moog is not in the list of ""the best companies in the US anymore!! "
bad,Terrible and Nasty place to work. Hasn't been cleaned in years. Horrible H.R department.
bad,"No respect for your work and people are selfish to satisfy only to their higher level, no training is provided for your future, no carrier development is provided by the company, there is no work life balance for the staffs, I never seen this kind of approach in any organization, only hire and fire. no respect for your efficiency"
bad,Workers in the same department doing the same work are not compensated the same nor are they held to the same work ethic standards. This makes it difficult to keep up morale.
bad,Used to be a great place to work until new management took over and started rewarding the incompetent and making the real workforce feel that their expertise did not matter and they were replaceable. It became a job not a career and co workers started pointing fingers at one another to take some scrutiny off themselves and direct it at others who would not play the political game.
bad,"If you are an experienced hands on engineer look further, after you realize that the job has no value added to you. You got to follow instructions and copy previous work. Moog will keep you if you are grosly underpaid. The experienced enginners turn over rate is pretty high. If you are strait out of school take the job."
bad,Company allows and accommodates incompetence while punishing those who value quality.  Was told in many different ways to cut quality since only speed and low cost are valued. Expected to take on many different roles outside role hired for.
bad,"The poor management of the company is unable to provide a vision. Therefore currently the company is reducing its workforce to increase the shareholders profit. At least in Germany they cannot manage to enter new fields like electromechanic market, so they stay with the hold hydraulic stuff. Not a good place for young people if you are not in line with the old fashioned management. Fron time to time hire and fire also in Germany ..."
bad,"My experience learning was great, but management have a lot to learn, when I was working they have very low staff I was doing more than just one person job"
bad,Management doesn't care about fair they only care about politically correct and that is to back the lazy troublemaking employees instead of the hardworking dependable honest employees. Unless you grew up in the Blacksburg Virginia area you are treated like an outsider and hazed and harassed. Very very disfunctional workplace.
bad,"An aweful experience, no moral standard to be found.Just bad disrespectful managers who love  to lie...especially the materials manager and racist shipping and receiving supervisor. Run from  this place and dont look back."
bad,"All management= egotistical and incompetent"
bad,Typical company.  Management doesn't know that their subordinates do.  Favoratisim and mismanagement are the rule of the day.  The company principles are only a marketing scheme.
bad,Low morale and no solid direction from management. Always in a state of chaos due to recalls and lack of key resources.
bad,Management cares little for employees.
bad,Don't work there. It does not exist anymore because it went under and is moved to the East Coast. No one offered a position in the East Coast left for the job.
bad,"Nothing much to say about the company."
bad,"Rookie employees are getting promoted to Sr.level roles just for kissing you know what. "
bad,"The work was easy, and people i worked with was very nice. work hours was good at first, then they started not having parts to work, and was sent home, sometimes week at a time, or go to work for about 2 hours then sent home, management didn't want to work with some people, they had there picks, and sometimes how they talked to you, and you did not have to good of a chance to move up into the company."
bad,"work culture is horrible "
bad,Moog was a great company to work for.  Unfortunately new CEO has come in and people want to leave.  Not a fun company to work for anymore.
bad,Unfair treatment of employees. Not a trusting company. Management gives latitude and then punishes for relying on that latitude.
bad,Seriously the most unqualified management ever. Pay their employees peanuts and they LAID ME OFF. Stay away from this company!!
bad,"If you like being micromanaged and part of a clique, this would be a good place for you to work. I for one did not appreciate not being trusted to do my own job."
bad,"work is easy but slow, management is rude and unprofessional towards contract employee for the processing department. I can't speak for the other departments."
bad,"In my time at Moog, I witnessed the most buerocratic and hypocritical management team that I have ever seen. They are always pushing the ""Moog culture"" which stresses ""mutual trust and respect"" but management always overlooks the ""mutual"" part. I have been flat out lied to and disrespected with no signs of remorse or apathy. "
bad,"Manegers are leasy and annoing. But they pay well to work for them. If you can call it ""work"""
bad,"Don't let it's reputation fool you.  They paint a pretty picture, but in reality, there is alot of 'good ole boys' clubbing going on.  If you want to look the other way on your ethics, then this is the place to be."
bad,"Direct supervisor was unprofessional, dramatic, unsatisfiable, poor training, poor instructions, promoted stress related work environment on a daily basis being instructed to secretiveness."
bad,"Looked very good on the outside, but very different on the inside.  You need to watch your back and be very careful who you trust.  The new management team is still feeling their way around and the office politics are really bad.  Factor workers are on OT one month and the next they are having an early out program."
bad,"Do not value the qualification "
bad,"Moog founders created a policy about trust in their people however over the years this has evolved into an environment of extremely dishonest and unethical people. While Moog has been generous with work hours and compensation, it is very poorly managed by people unqualified for the positions they hold. Moog wants to be an ""Aerospace"" company, buts falls short with unskilled and unprofessional management. Lay offs target people who have ""fallen out of favor"" with someone and most often result in letting exceptional people go while retaining unethical people. This was the worst company I have ever worked for in terms of management."
bad,The hardest part of the job is seeing how the supervisors pick out favorites and push all the others to the side. My first job i ever had had a better pay rate than MOOG. They had me doing about 4 or 5 different tasks while some people would be on there phone a good bit of the day while i had no time to even think about doing.
bad,"Cool place to work but not a secure job. Was a temp. Training was okay. It's not about quality it's about speed. Advice to management, quality first then speed will come. Have some patience. Over all disappointed with company."
bad,"I cleaned the restrooms, office areas, cafeteria and plant floor. Took out trash throughout the plant and outside cans as well. Ran floor scrubber on plant floor."
bad,"Only game in town if you want a decent paying job in western New York. They know this and take full advantage of it. When the heat is on, all blame is passed down to lowest levels with no management accountability to be found anywhere. A true boys club where the managers all look out for each other and only have YOU there to take the blame when things go wrong. Product line is boring and unchallenging. "
bad,"401K match is low compared to other companies. Only 50% match. They require to travel out of the country which is NOT in the job description, work/life balance is not a priority."
bad,"The iconic culture installed by Bill Moog is quickly disappearing within the Aircraft Group.  ""Mutual Trust and Respect"" and ""Trust is a must"" only applies to an inner circle of the good ole boys club.  The mere mention of it on the floor brings sarcastic laughter.  Management lacks integrity in an environment of finger pointing and blame shifting.  Most of management has an arrogance that is only surpassed by the lack knowledge of the actual product/work in their areas of responsibility.  (Nearly every manager has never performed the work)  The best workers are overloaded and worn out, but expected to make up the difference of the majority.  As a result the best folks are leaving, while quality and on time delivery plummet.  The response to this has been to hire another entire layer of inexperienced management, usually personal friends of senior managers.  There is little to no focus on creating a quality work force or addressing glaring lack of discipline and accountability.  Trainees are training other trainees on a regular basis because the actual trainers have given up and left for other departments. "
bad,"This is a technology company ,contract with Gov. but sadly, the main core is not like that....lets look in...."
bad,Typical day includes assembling products by using blueprints. Must be able to use a computer and pull up documentation. Working with chemicals can be a daily thing.
bad,They removed the ping pong table! Managers are unappreciative of my company contribution over the long years I spent at the company. Deceptive age discrimination is common.
bad,"Started in the Repair lab in working in repairing old Navigational Aid equipment.  Some of the test procedures you couldn't make heads or tails out of.  Constantly, I had to pick the brains of other technicians and engineers (irritating at the most).  After a few months, I got the hang of the Repair lab and felt comfortable.  Around 3 months in, upper management decided to shuffle everybody around, so I moved to the production manufacturing department.  I thought this would be great.  No!  I had to work with this young girl who just came from the Navy and thought she was all that and had a bad attitude.  Really?  Then there was this upper management guy who would always come around hassling everybody about their current projects all day long.  I thought to myself just leave me alone and I can get more done!  The floor supervisor would always be looking for your first mistake.  And when you did make your first mistake, then they take you to the Human Resources office!  This place made me feel unworthy.  As an employee, you shouldn't have to kiss up to people, just do your job and go home.  So after I made my 2nd mistake, he walked me to the HR department where he wanted to fire me.  The HR guy is obviously in with the management so I had no chance.  Advice:  Stay Away From The Sinking Ship!"
bad,"Moog components pays well..... Good job security, but the management lies and uses you, then throws you under the bus when something goes wrong.they have good PTO, and the working environment"
bad,they will point fingers at you and throw you under the bus to move up the ladder. ya can't trust anyone. hard work get ya nothing rat on you fellow workers and get them in trouble you move up in the company.
bad,"The product is of interest in a modern Technology sense thus making the job having worth. However, the management and favoritism is truly the biggest down fall of Moog. Moog is built on nepotism which employees are hired because of who they know NOT what they know. The Managers need to be cleaned out so the place can be run by persons other than the good old buddy system."
bad,"Moog is a smaller Department of Defense subcontractor who supplies items for Lockheed and Raytheon. The environment was rather low key and there were really only between 20-30 people on the manufacturing floor at any given time. The co-workers were nice and the hardest part of the job was the repetitive motions of mass production on a day to day basis. Management had a ""favorites"" system with the actual permanent employees which provided them with luxuries of not having to get the quota for the day on how many pieces they were suppose to assemble. The over used temp service is why I would give Moog Inc a 2 star rating. Start giving these hard workers benefits and actual job security and it would be a good company to work for."
bad,Senior Leadership acted unprofessionally in the work place.  There were unrealistic expectations given the marketshare and quality of product. We expected several service interruptions to our customers on a vital products.
bad,"I was told that i would receive no raises or advancement in the company unless i was continuing my education, that was incentive enough to leave the company.  Best move I have ever made.  Very low pay for a very expensive place to live.  People say WNY is a cheap place to live, they are living in a dream world."
bad,"It was good to work at Moog, many things are for learning, theory as well as practical expose, good lab hydraulic and electronics activities. Very bad top level management, they does not have sense of work happening at ground level and making and changing the decision"
bad,typical day of work is 50/50 split of at desk activities and hands on work out in the lab.  awesome local management and coworkers.  globally not the same story….
bad,"Not worth putting in the effort you won't get noticed."
bad,"Typical day is like any other place. Laid back environment, most people are enjoyable to speak to and learn from."
bad,"Unless you are a male or have been there for 10+ years, you will not fit in. Very much an 'old boys club.' No one there can make a decision if their life depended on it."
bad,"A typical day more Mech Design Engr. is creating very challenging designs in terms of performance, weight, etc. to meet customer requirements. While at Moog I have definitely sharpened my technical skills and have learned things which will benefit me (and new employer) in my next career move."
bad,"Moog could be a great place to work if not for the bad management and HR departments.the wage increases are good,you can get good time off,and they will let you make up time"
good,"Working closely with patients and along with coworkers.  The physicans will talk down to the employees in front of others, with patients hearing what is being said.  A very hostile enviroment, always threatening to cut hours."
good,When I first Started at Moog it was an amazing atmosphere and great people.  As time went on new managers started taking over and currently they are tearing the company apart from the inside out.  Most enjoyable was the paycheck.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with different people barking orders all contradicting themselves thus forcing you to work overtime to pick up all the pieces.
good,Would be a decent place to work if the nepotism was not rampant impossible to get promoted unqualified family and friends get promoted and management is horrible the new vacation policy sucks new people get more paid time off than 15 year vets so many new employees and no accountability for mistakes company going on a very bad direction
good,Had no chance from the start. Person training me didn't want anyone else there. Acted very unprofessional and childish. Had no skills in training people.
good,Not a good place to work. Individuality and creativity are discouraged though given mouth service. Dishonesty seems to be the main driver in most business and employee dealings.
good,"Good coworkers but not the best managers.  Upper management seemed not to care about workers.  Managers were a bit cut throat.  Demanding hours, as in daily overtime and 13 days on 1 day off.  Many temps with few being made full time regular employees."
good,"First few years I had plenty of opportunities to grow into many different places in the department however once I transitioned under new management I was no longer positively encouraged to grow, I was held in a stagnant position and was no longer acknowledged for jobs well done and it created a toxic environment to work in."
good,"Great place to work, great people and management.  However,  ensure that oyu are properly aligned with the position you are accepting, Moog translates positions differently then ordinary organizations"
good,"When I interviewed at MOOG, they said I didn't need any experience. So far from the truth, I was thrown in to Teamcenter support. Cloning servers, and refreshing servers. Also, creating clients for a particular environment. I specialize in Desktop support. This was WAY out of my realm. A bit of a toxic environment."
good,I worked directly for the quality manager. Unfortunately He should have been a production manager numbers guy in a quality position meant frequent arguments that led directly to my dismissal.
good,Change of approach to procurement has left me wondering if they are doing the correct thing. I suppose time will tell. I left because I felt the new management style was unworkable. I suppose time will tell.
good,"Management unable to perform the job. No experience working with the manufacturing base. Black box operations, monitor the inputs and outputs, without concern for internal workings. Experienced workers leaving or retiring with no training for new hires."
good,"Moog as a company, it is a good place to work. It has good work life balance. Growth wise it is not promising.  It terms of learning for beginners, it is not that much."
good,A typical day at MOOG would be a busy and fun day. Working with my colleagues is like having a brotherhood that we support each other. Management are so demanding that shipment is more important than their people.
good,"Too much politics, too much out of touch with employees or their concerns.Great projects and challenging work. Most floor employees are skilled and easy to work with."
good,My daily duties are to work on the a/r aging report and contact customers.  Solve and research problems w/ invoices.  
good,Exciting projects with the dynamic of working with a variety of diverse people in various functions
good,It's an ok place to work but I feel management does not appreciate their hardest workers I'm ready for a fresh start with a company that appreciates my work
good,"sr manager is biased, dishonest, and doesn't treat employees fairly"
good,Fast paced environment centered around individual performance.  Company focuses on contract work to meet influx of work .  Good for getting experience and moving on.  Bad for job security and social life.  Moog makes up for this with competitive pay.
good,"Most of the team members are great to work with.  The ""Moog Culture"" if it was redheaded to by all, would be a great environment to work in & grow with."
good,It's a good place to work . We work 10 hour days 6 am to 4:30 pm Fridays are overtime. It's some fast pace and some slow pace. The management mostly cares about their employees.
good,Great place to work not a lot of room for advancement in your career the people are really nice and fun to work with can be extremely stressful at times
good,Standard 8 hour day.  Get some experience using OOP.  Poorly managed location.  Hardest part was working the some of the FPGA design engineers.
good,"A typical day at work depends upon how busy the company is.  Work is very cyclical and there can be periods where no work is available and the day consists of absolutely no productivity.  The system in which Moog employees charge time can be very convoluted.  Employees must charge work order numbers in order to document the time spent at work.  If no work is available employees must charge overhead.  During the lulls of work, supervisors seem reluctant to allow employees to use their time for self-improvement activates such as research and development.  Supervisors would rather the employees charge overhead and do nothing then take initiative to self-improve."
good,"My time at Moog was mostly positive. The pay was average and so was the holiday entitlement. The big positive was the early finish on a Friday. You will only progress at this company if you bow down to the big boss lady, which I wasn’t prepared to do."
good,Management is not engaged and the inmates typically run the asylum. Decisions are made purely based on financials and long term success is an after thought.
good,"plenty of hours, decent pay, terrible from a management perspective. lots of room for upward movement. good benefits (healthcare, 401K, stock options, profit sharing, etc)."
good,"A typical day at work starts with raising Quotes from  brief emails from customers or sales managers. Looking through emails to enter orders and raise warranty files. Apply for export licences with Government Bodies. Then issue all documentation such as certificate of origins with Chamber of commerce, permission to ship with HMRC, despatch notes invoices and certificate of conformance through the Efacs system. Act as switchboard to answer all phone calls and let people in through the door.  Maintain the CRM database, enter new customers and apply with accounts for credit limits."
good,Very low paying job with a lot of extra work. Work was enjoyable but environment was not. I learned a great deal about measurement tools and quality inspection. Really was not a job with much hope to advance. Management did not seem very interested in taking suggestions. I really enjoyed the people i worked with.
good,It is the only company that I am employed Full time. It gives Benefits as per law. It is also one of the company that gives a little bit higher or competitive outside our City.
good,"honestly not my line of work since this is a member of metal factory. however, I enjoyed working at first and learned new things about servo-valves and actuators especially used on BOEING and AIRBUS."
good,Interesting place to work. Due to the small number of people at the location there is always plenty of work to be done and in most cases to much for such a small team. An excellent place to work if you are already an expert in your field. If you are looking for guidance and direction then this is not the place for you.
good,"Do it the first time, quality first before cost and delivery."
good,"Use tools such as screwdrivers, pliers, crimpers, drills, soldering irons, precision measuring instruments and other hand tools. "
good,Very slow paced job you are sitting all day long the team excepted everyone and was willing to help you out when you needed it. The pay was fairly low
good,"To many chiefs, not enough Indians.  Found over and over again."
good,this is my first job working for aircraft hydraulic controls aof boeing and airbus arcrafts.i begun working for the electro hydraulic servovalve which controls the flow of fluid to an actuator which controls a certain part or movable part or an aircraft such as spoilers and ailerons.
good,i had an enjoyable working experience in this company. they balanced the time for work and family and with a very reasonable salary and balance environment
good,"Good workplace. The employees are very approachable and friendly. They do not have a strict ""do it quickly"" policy but if there is a need to finish it they do it."
good,"Processes not well documented, information transfer thru tribal knowledge, requires contact with an individual familiar with the process in question. Issues arise with difficulty finding subject matter experts (SME's), to gleem tribal knowledge from."
good,"Not a very organized office,and not good time management skills. I was able to learn how to work in a fast pace office setting, and I enjoyed working with the patients."
good,Standard machine operator positions. Make sure to arrive on time. Good opportunities for furthering education in current position or lateral or upward movement within the company.
good,Setup and run two 3-axis Okuma VMCs simultaneously for 8 hours a day.  The hardest part was dealing too many pressures from varying levels of management.
good,Nothing to report that's significant to your question. Each experience is unique and mine will differ from yours.  The context of this message spells..
good,"Moog Controls Corporation is an aerospace company that focuses on the quality and safety of the company."
good,Moog is a good job for part time. It can be stressful with the culture and high school mentality. Cleaners are looked at like maids. Benefits are good. Vacation day given monthly and sick time yearly. Overall decent job.
good,"Work quality is highly dependent on office.  Mine was diverse, fairly interesting and the people were high quality.  Politics and bureaucracy motivated people to leave."
good,"Corporate driven matrix task-output."
good,"19 years ago it was a pretty enjoyable experience"
good,I enjoyed my experience as an co-op in the Aircraft group. I was given high profile opportunities even as a co-op. Lots of very smart employees. Lots to learn from.
good,"The people are great but Moog tends to use people for different things than their skills offer. They would be better off hiring less contractors. Overall, it is a nice environment."
good,Moog has good working environment but needs to work on its leadership and career advancement specially for those in the production line. Overall I still recommend that its a good place to work in.
good,Fast pace -excellent opportunity for people who can devote 65 hours a week to get ahead. People on the floor are friendly and very cooperative. Some management can be hard to get along with
good,overall company was a good company to work for but the management was dysfunctional. the products were innovative and i was challenge there.  there was no room to move up.
good,"Excellent place to work.  Good benefits, pay, atmosphere.  Dinners as a group. Celebrate birthday.  Catered dinners for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Bonus at Christmas."
good,"Wander full company "
good,"Could be a good  company to work for. If Moog paid more. The  company  has descent  vacation,. They let you leave early for Dr  appointments and family  emergency."
good,"Moog is a great place to work, I have learned a great deal about project management and operations during my time at Moog.  Currently, the space market is in a decline and I'm looking for other opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed my job except for the lack of security, I gained experience in blood draws and other medical procedures, enjoyed my co-workers, I enjoyed working with the employees the hardest part of my job was keeping up with all the paperwork"
good,Moog is the best Work for me in the Philippines.. People are fun and nice to work with.. work is an enjoyable experience with an environment of mutual trust and confidence. Thanks to Moog... It changes my life and given me the oppurtunity to strive and look for development in life..
good,"Moog make high technology aerospace systems and need skilled workers and engineers. Several years ago senior management decided they needed to make the company more competive, so some years we had small pay rises and some years none at all. As a result the skilled people left. Then the company could not get the work done. In my dept chaos, quality problems and blame were normal. Local managers would not provide simple equipment that I asked for to improve/lighten my tasks, dispite wasting large sums of money on thier pet projects. As the number of lab technicians were reduced over the years the number and range of tasks I was required to undertake increased without support or backup. Nepotism was common. Amoungst the routine work there were often technically challenging tasks that kept me interested."
good,I’ve worked here for 5 years and I’m ready to move on to another city that’s why I’m looking for a new job...the work is steady and the pay is okay. Moog is growing every year
good,"Good company, good work environment and culture, good work and family balance. A great place to learn and begin your career."
good,"Moog has been a good company to work for, except for a few areas, they are 3-4 years out of date with the software they depend on. and like all big corporations they are working to outsource everything from manufacturing to engineering to off shore companies."
good,needs to improve management leadership in implementing equal opportunities among employees.
good,"Ok job, decent benefits, pretty awful pay and advancement is next to none, unless you know how to suck up. I recieved a Bachelors and now Im leaving. Do their own things their own way. Management is awful, Best thing about the place is the workers and culture."
good,"Remote management."
good,"Plan and design sub-assemblies to completed final assembly Slip Rings drawings using "
good,"the management was very good at Moog, I had to leave because of the distance i was having to travel every day .the benefits and salary are very generous as well."
good,"MOOG Controls have a good culture"
good,"We repaired medical equipment with a variety of defects, tested them, identified and removed the cause of the fault. "
good,"You have to know someone to get promoted. However, the work they do is extremely important and impacting to others in the world. I felt a sense of pride working there, but I did not have room for advancement, because I did not know the right people or I was not related to certain people."
good,nice but going through severe and quick growth for a small company bought by big one and trying to adjust. The big company has set practices that they are trying to implement
good,"Moog wants to have it's cake and eat it on the management cultural approach: It wants to be a locally focused family friendly organisation while at the same time having the single consistent policies of a large multinational. There are places where this works well- in the work/life balance equation for example- but places where it is a source of frustration- when trying to get consistent answers from each site on a common customer requirement. "
good,"Good employer in the Blacksburg, VA area. Decent pay and benefits. Typical manufacturing environment. Helpful coworkers."
good,"The position is challenging and engaging, everyone in the company is very talented and hard working.  The company has some communication problems, however I really enjoyed my time there.  I left because of the lack of work life balance.  I worked on third shift and didn't have anytime with my family, which was the hardest part of the job for me.  The last couple of managers I have had are great and still work there.  The only problem with management there was that they are going through some restructuring so people are stretched a little thin and no room for advancement at the moment.  I have had 7 different managers with in the 22 months that I worked there so that is the reason for the 3 star management rating.  However, the people in the roles now are a great fit.  Departmental communication is an issue but I believe that will be resolved by management.  I would recommend working there overall."
good,My career at Moog provided exposure to a variety of technology and the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment with many talented people.
good,Company treats employees fairly. Good benefits. Pay can be low depending upon role. Vacation is fair if planned in advance. Lots of good people to work with.
good,Productive and steady work. Boring at times. Pay was fairly low in my opinion. Days were often slow from being required to sit for so long. It was friendly place.
good,Management was willing to work with you. The atmosphere was laid back so that there wasn't any stress over formality and were able to focus more on your job.
good,"Good stepping stone. They like to hire contract employees and keep  them as contract employees for a long time. Love the company,but I need benefits.."
good,"Arrive at 8, go to your station and start building. I learned about electronics, got better at soldering, and used multimeters and oscilloscopes. Hardest part is the monotony."
good,Great place for any person for  either an experienced hire or a first timer.  Many positions available for many levels of growth.  Highly recommended.
good,"MCG is a good place to work.  It has a good work/life balance work atmosphere.  Wages are not as good as some other places.  Is a good place to receive lots of ""bennies"".  They have lots of drawings, contests and ways to earn extra prizes."
good,"Lot of challenging work to do. Lot of learning. "
good,Moog had so much work when I was there that you could always find something to do. The recession hit and the company suffered; but the company found a way to stay busy time after time. The work was challenging and they provided you with all of the tools and training you needed to do your job well.
good,"Great OEM engineering team, dedicated to providing excellence in achieving customer requirements. Support engineering operate at the highest level of integrity and attention to detail."
good,"If you are looking for a challenging career with some of the smartest and dedicated engineers around, this is the place for you."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the end product in motion and being a part of such an Innovative company. The company is very Lean-focused and empowers employees to lead and implement improvement initiative.
good,"My days currently consists of stacking, harnessing, potting, inspection, visuals, lock wiring, soldering/ solder sleeves, alignment of brush blocks, cleaning of slip rings, working with customers (when they visit),  training, using a blueprint, dimensions, and shipping."
good,Good people to work with whom are concerned about making quality product. Great opportunities to learn new things and each day is different.
good,This internship gave me the amazing opportunity to work on a process improvement project. The greatest challenge and most beneficial part of the internship was working with floor operators to investigate issues in the process. Management was very supportive and provided me with guidance when necessary.

good,"Moog acquired a company I worked for and closed the doors on us.  They were genuine in the beginning,  but as time went on,  like all corporate giants,  the smaller outfit became a casualty of the industry.  The crazy part about closing our division is that they didn't even send upper management to break the news to us.  But overall they honored the longevity of all the employees and gave us a mediocre severance package.  Cut our Benefits,  before they supposed to and never told us.  All in all... It's a well established giant that looks to buy smaller technology that they can profit from and if they don't,  they'll just shut the doors and move on to the next.

Each person from supervisor to machinist have a share of inputs why a non-conformance occur and how to prevent it from happening again. The hardest part of it is to gather each accountable person to a single meeting. The most enjoyable part of the job is the chance to learn new technical knowledge in each area from engineering blueprint to actual machining process and measurement, to metallurgy and special processing and industry standards."
good,"Good place to work."
good,"In general, Moog calls me directly when they need something done in a hurry. They pay well for my services, and get their money's worth. The upper level management has made some bad decisions over the course of the last 8 years, resulting in some fairly severe downsizing and loss of business. The engineering management is generally pretty competent. My first stint at Moog was to educate their engineers on FAA DO-254 / NASA 7123 processes, and also to see a major product release from concept to TSO. Where Moog and other companies stumble is in the outsourcing department. Many of my consulting positions have happened because a company has gotten back a product from the far east that does ""A"", but their requirements need it to do ""B"". Normally, such a situation demands a complete redesign. Outsourcing is a fad that has definitely kept my consulting business very busy over the past 15 years in general."
good,"I enjoy working there everyday. Great people to work with. Working here is like your at home wherein we practice a culture of mutual trust and confidence."
good,"When working at Moog Inc, I was a co-op, and therefore I did not receive the same benefits as a full time salary employee.  That being said, i did enjoy the working environment; regardless of your position with the company, everyone addressed one another on a first name basis  That degree of informality lead to a more comfortable working experience.  The co-workers were pretty friendly as well; many of them were willing to organize extra curricular activities (such as different recreational sports teams).  Moog was my first exposure to the corporate environment, and one of the most valuable lessons were the simple do's and don'ts for any corporate job (such as communication being an essential driver for completing tasks correctly and efficiently)."

good,"The people I work with are fantastic, goofy but serious when needed, and I'm given a lot of autonomy. I basically design products from scratch, often solo or in a small team (< 3 people). This allows for a breadth of knowledge to be gained, but also a fair amount of struggle. This is good, as I'm at the beginning of my career and this job has set me up to work in many fields. I'll be looking forward to my next opportunity when it comes time to move on, hopefully still within the company."

The employees were very nice and there was never a time in the duration of my internship that I felt like I didn't belong to the company. I really admire the work ethics of everyone and the company's philosophy that its employees practise. I was an IT student and even though a lot of people think that the company's main operations are not related to my field, I was able to use my IT skills and created a program that somehow, I hope so, made a difference and improved a process in the company."

good,"Moog is an oasis populated with highly intelligent and specialized individuals whose expertise ranges from welding to astr physics. Although they are highly educated and extremely knowledgeable in their fields they are also very down to earth and likeable. The company culture has endured since the founders origins in the late 1950's and the spirit and attitude of just about everybody is ""It's my job"" instead of It's not my job. The company is growing quickly over the past 3-4 years and the growth is somewhat overtaking the business systems that have been in place for many years however, the work force accepts this and makes do with what is currently available. Working with the US Government and Aerospace Industries requires a lot of rigor and exactness and therefore the work environment from that perspective is slow and cautious. The workers are all very poilte, respectful and motivated in part by great benefits, good pay and the promise of Profit Sharing each year."
