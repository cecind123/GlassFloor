rating,review
bad,"Too much stress/ management does not appreciate all efforts that have to be done, in order to be successful. The correct tools are not provided to go above and beyond. Motivation does not exist among workers due to the fact that no progress is being made with employees satisfaction."
bad,Bad company to work for management is very unprofessional HR is very unprofessional the building is self is not a safe environment there is no training put in place for any of the zone leads management is messy their HR does not keep things confidential my whole entire time working at that place was working in It is not a great place to work they treat their employees like slaves is very unsanitary nasty not clean at all
bad,"You will have no life at all if you work here. The people are awful, the managers are even worst, they work you all day like animal with no care for your wellbeing."
bad,Not a very nice place to work for most people. Mandatory overtime if you are a temp. It is very hard to get hired on and is very miss managed. Everything they teach you about work culture and ergonomics in the orientation goes out the window once you're on the floor. But it definitely put food on the table.
bad,"quick pace nonstop[ "
bad,Mal ambiente inestabilidad laboral mamoneo del sindicato
bad,I hated the job the day I walked in and still hated it the day I walked out. There is no enjoyable part of the job.the culture was tons of hours and under paid compared to job classifications anywhere else. I lost s lot of time with my family I will never get back from working there. The management is definitely lacking in leadership skills.
bad,"Never would know when you will get off, work like robots expected to turn water into wine basically. No organization, a lot of point the finger to pin blame on someone.."
bad,"Steel case is a ""yes sir"" company. If you say not to any of the superiors you might as well call it quits because they will not promote you if your not willing to sell your soul"
bad,They have poor management they treat you like nothing they don’t appreciate they work or anything I be there thirteens year and it took me eight years to get a raise
bad,"Pocas oportunidades de promocion para profesionistas, mala cafeteria, mal trato de lideres de produccion a operadores, preferencia a familiares y conocidos para vacantes, falta de departamento de entrenamiento, mala administracion de los recursos, sin sindicato."
bad,Job was micro managed by security cameras and female discrimination was too overwhelming. i was told to take my tool box home and was the only model maker not allowed to have a tool box at work. I was told how to dress and the men were not.
bad,They claim to be family oriented when they aren't. They make you choose between your job and your family. You lose your job if you have family emergency that can't be helped
bad,Terrible work environment. I was hired as DevOps and was asked by the director how to fix a database testing issue and was told it was too expensive. Company wanted DevOps but management was not committed. I had a health issue while I was there and HR treated me like a liar and a criminal.
bad,This is the worst job I have ever been at they lied about my pay the job was awful the break are short and co-workers all seemed very unhappy.the let 2 people go the first 2 days I was there management is a complete joke
bad,"Really don't have much to say, not a place I care to work at any longer. Upper Management needs more training on how to communicate with their teams."
bad,"Don't train you properly and white manager walk around the warehouse like slave owner, complaining all the time about working at fast pace, this place is horrible place to work."
bad,"Responsable service action client"
bad,this was a temp job
bad,Company moving produces to Mexico and Alabama for cheap labor!
bad,"Steelcase, Inc is stuck in the 'family' mentality. All that matters is who you know, and the only thing valued is tenure. You can be terrible at your job, but if you have been there for 20 years, you are safe. "
bad,"Made many friends there, and hope many of them still have employment.  Much of the management were total idiots to say nicely.  Couldn't wait to find a better job."
bad,"Never enough work, management fighting and talking bad about each other."
bad,hot environment not to much  pressure but management is okay..
bad,"NEVER WORK FOR THIS COMPANY! They are not there to help when you need it or promote anyone worthy. 3 years there, missed 10 days was fired& refused unemployment. Other Z.L. missed in 1 year 150 days and was promoted and able to start and leave whenever. You cannot have a life. Min work week is 65 hours which go up to 80 working 7 days a week for 3 months. You will not be appreciate. "
bad,They try to interfear with your personal life to the point where you hate the place. The management sucks they don't know the jobs and try to interfear with your job if your doing it safely and efficiently as possible. Steelcase say they are all about safety and they don't care if you get hurt on the job or not they will try there best not to pay workmans comp. Steelcase will also try to ruin your personal and work life. Its a poor excuse for a job. Only go there if you really are desperate for a job.
bad,"it was not always the best place to work and after becoming permanent, things did not even become any better"
bad,"Management team is awful. They will yell at employees to go faster and if they don’t, they threaten them. They take advantage of the good employees, so when they are falling behind they use those good associates to pick up their, supervisors, mistakes. Will get yelled at for just walking out of your truck to get a drink of water for more than 3 seconds."
bad,"Mid level management hiring zone leaders that have little to no leadership experience.  This is not an opinion this was told to me directly by the Team Lead Supervisor (who is over all the team leads). Team leads do not have to have any leadership experience to get hired -from the outside.  Team leads are rarely to never hired from inside the company. 100% turnover in the area I started in.  Somebody goofed in top level management and made someone a shift supervisor that does not know anything about caring for morale.  I like to say this ""supervisor"" is 'oblivious to the human condition.'"
bad,"If you enjoy watching your hard work not matter because you aren’t related to anyone here, this is the job for you! Do you love being told you have to work the entire weekend on Friday? Come on down!!!! Do you dream of making such a low wage you live paycheck to paycheck even though you work overtime every single week? You’ll be in heaven here! Do you enjoy watching parts with quality issues ship out? Oh, you’ll be drooling. "
bad,"Tiene un buen ambiente laboral, se me hace una buena empresa para empezar a agarrar experiencia pero no si quieres crecer, ya que los puestos que tienen aqui son los mas leves."
bad,Co workers nice a lot of the management are racist and show it.ive discriminated against.it was ignored .A lot of young people in charge place has no structure. A lot of violations going on that are totally ignored work you like a slave show you no respect if your skin tone is brown.i dread going to work some days but the pay is great!c can’t wait to find another department to transfer to.
bad,"Management sucks they don't know how or what they do. One tells you one thing then another tells you another thing , and then wrong is you. But still you got to do it the Wright way not the way they tell you . Non of them gets it .."
bad,"They would have me drive all the way down there from Hesperia at 3 am just to tell me sometimes just to go home, plus the supervisor told me he loved my long hair and said it makes him want to rub himself I was grossed out or more like disgusted with what had happened and I quit and cut my hair because of it."
bad,This company has no tolerance for an outsiders perspective.  The company is run almost entirely by people have never had a job at another company before or if they did it was 30 years ago.
bad,"Ausergewöhnliche std. Woche"
bad,A typical day at work is like trying to overcome all obstacles that are thrown at you on a daily basis. I have to run different machinery and keep up with the daily work loads.
bad,"Once a thriving people oriented, customer focused company, that has lost its direction. Leadership within the company is lacking."
bad,Although out of one side of their mouth they say ... all engineers are created equal ... reality is this is not the case. Politics play heavily in this sweatshop ... their manufacturing technology is critically lacking and substandard. Good thing is that I learned a lot about press operations and dies. The floor level people and fellow engineers are very helpful and want to do a good job. Management (not necessarily Engineering) makes it very difficult to invest in the company's own future even if the nee ed seems obvious.
bad,This was the worse place I have work. Hours were unpredictable no work life balance. The two treated employees like slaves.. would never work there again or recommend any civilized human to seek employment there.
bad,"general lack of advancement options unless you have family connects with lots of years. Has a good old boy club setting, old timers protect old timers while the new do all the work loads."
bad,My manpower rep did not represent me when issues came about. my zone leader was disrespectful and couldn't handle the job. I had no life there i was either working 12 hours and then sleep and follow it up with a 4 our shift so all my hard work and possible OT from the previous day just gets stripped.
bad,I worked in the level 3 area which is the CNC mill department and immediate surrounding area. I can honestly say the zone leader was the most deceitful person I’ve ever met. He told me I was doing a great job the entire time I worked there while telling upper management the exact opposite.  I should have listened to the rumors about him being a “ snake in the grass”. I left a good job to work contract at steelcase. Needless to say that was a HUGE mistake. If you like drama and politics Steelcase is the job for you. But don’t be surprised when you get a phone call one afternoon informing you that your contract wasn’t extended dispite the fact that you put the most production of anyone in your work area and never missed a single day of work.
bad,"One of the best platforms for Knowledge seekers, a lot of lerning. Organization allows people to perform with high expectation. High performance organization with high expectations."
bad,The job is very demanding physically and you work very hard for little pay. The breaks are short and the hours are not enough. You barely get 40 hours a week.
bad,"it was a great place to work right out of high school. Had awesome"
bad,"Some managers love to micro-manage. There is a lot of ""playing favorites"". Not a career company like it used to be. The bonuses are nice, but they've seemed to drop every year, even though the company makes billions."
bad,was alright place to work for the paycheck and the people i with were alright as well and the supervisors and leads were just the same. it was and alright place to work at
bad,"This place laid people off on a daily bases, I was there for a day.  Me and 13 people were laid off in to weeks. Work is not hard. They don't give people a chance."
bad,"From the time you start off in the warehouse, the imagery of a promising employment there is not so much in reach. Being very grateful for the opportunity in which to work for any company is my outlook. I tried daily to enjoy my job and do as I was told to do. "
bad,Come in to work and put office furniture together. Got two to three breaks depending on hours. Had a non paid lunch and a normal 8 hour day was with two more braks if we worked more than 10 we got another break. Was told at the last minute that it was time to go. Never knew when the day would end. Management sucked because of the fact that they would not work with people because they did not want to get anybody else to do the job. They did not make people do things or help out. The work was not bad but the speed and the heat was horrible and there was only one shift so work had to go out no matter what. The people that worked there was the only enjoyable part.
bad,I worked there throughout school.  It was a good intership/ starting position.
bad,"Certaines personnes possèdent une place inappropriées au sein de l'entreprise... Ce qui engendre assez régulièrement des gros problème de gestion de stock. Cela grâce au ""copinage"" de certain."
bad,"My review at Steelcase as an employee is this. The management are not displaying good leadership."
bad,"Heavy work if you have more important things going in your life.  Management is rude and yell at you like if your a slave,  people come and go like crazy, i believe because of the pressure from management, they lie about your schedule and always have you coming in for overtime, this job is perfect for those who like to have no freedom .     Thankful for the job nevertheless , things could go more safe in there."
bad,Entry level pay is far less than market average. Management is generally fun and helpful.  Vacation hours are few and far between.  Communication between departments is awful. HR is very slow with applications for new jobs within the company.
bad,"I took this job only because they came after me for a second time following the buyout of my former employer, Conwed-Weyerhauser."
bad,Steelcase was down sizeing all its locations. Layffs going on and replacing with all temp workers left a bad feeling with its employees. Was once one of the best companies around to work for.
bad,Too much drama from the supervisors. Human resources is not helpful at all.
bad,"Really did not like the job but it was a job at the time for me. I had better jobs, this was a job with real low hours. And I was trying to move up in production and could not because lack of management."
bad,"The pay wasn't too bad, but I often got stuck working long hours. The culture wasn't great always demanding unobtainable performance. I wasn't happy at work very often."
bad,I really like the job. I learned about new company's. They have good management. I get along with co-workers. The hardest part is when they put new people in different places. The most enjoyable thing is when my zone leader got married.
bad,The environment is very stressful. This is not a good environment to work in. The management is very poor and no one seem to care for the employees.
bad,"I did not like my stay at Steelcase. It seemed that every day was filled with stress. I did not like the way people pulled against"
bad,"I worked for Steelcase in Grand Prairie Texas for 14 years.  For the most part the first 10 years were great.  I really enjoyed what I did, who I worked for and with and the people that worked for me.  The last 4 years were taken over by corporate management."
bad,foaming all day on the line in shipping i pack  the furniture and pull up orders to the doors the management was good at first but it change   the hardest part of the job  there was any the most enjoyable  part working with some nice people
bad,As a sophomore in college I did not like working at Steel Case the only perk was the pay. Co-workers were never in a good mood the whole environment of the place was gloomy. I do not think I saw anyone smile while I worked there for the summer. It taught me that I should get a degree and make sure I never work in a factory again.
bad,"This company did not value me as a hard worker."
bad,The company pays well but forces 9 to 10 hours a day everyday. Management is ok but they don't care about their workers much and they pretty much drive you into the ground with hours. Unless you get first which does 8 to 9 with saturdays.
bad,"Work off a schedule, maintain quality, shipping, product,paint-line I had to manage 3 different areas;"
good,Steelecase isn’t a good place to build a career. It’s poor management and poor leaderships with the zone leaders. As far as the work it was very easy and laid back. It was just real bad leadership in the zones and with the management
good,More work than time to sleep or have social life. Limited pay and no compensation threw manpower. Was injured more than i was paid with no chance or compensation without a lawyer.
good,"there is no management you are there to clean, hours are crazy 12hrs continuous 5 days one week off 2 back on for 2 then off 5,  pay scale is way shy for the stupidity they provide.  the company is slowly working itself out of this country sold or gave away most of there buildings or they just sit empty"
good,In the past it was a good place to work and you were treated with respect and dignity. Now you are just a number to them and they have cut hours drastically and don't care about how you are making it financially. Fulltime employment is supposed to be 40 hrs per week. I haven't got 40 hrs but maybe 3 or 4 weeks out of the past yr.
good,"Good days work, but under terrible conditions No Air conditioning,"
good,"It was okay working there, just mindless labor and thankless attitudes.  No room to advance in leadership roles unless you are applying from outside the company."
good,"Takes too long to get hired in, paint line is not in order, zone leaders not doing their job. Very stressful place to work. Could use longer breaks in the summertime"
good,Not the same Steelcase of the past. They no longer care about there people its all about the money. The turn over in management is crazy.
good,I thought it would be a longer term job than it was.
good,"As a whole, Steelcase used to be the company to work for. I am not sure you can say that anymore. They have off shored a very large percent of their entry level positions. Almost all of their enty level finance positions were sent to Malaysia. Those positions that require same time zone presence were sent to Mexico. I gave 19 years to this company and was let go once my counterparts in Malaysia were secure in their position."
good,"Steelcase , insight driven , innovative , blend with trends .A good company on researches of workplace . Values on quality , product life cycle and contribution to green environment ."
good,"friendly workers, good mangement, and a very clean warehouse. Probably would have stayed there longer if i could but the location i was at had to downsize."
good,"I worked there in 2015 and it was ok until the managers started slacking and got disrespectful. On top of that, they let all of the temps go during the slower season and tried to bring us back two weeks later to work 3 hours per day like nah"
good,"Overall a good learning experience. I had the opportunity to work in different areas which allowed me to use different tools that were available. It a great place to gain a very solid working knowledge of SAP. The manufacturing floor can be a little intimidating, but stick with it and there are great learning opportunities here. You do seem to plateau quickly though as far as advancement."
good,Loading trucks from front to back by hand. Lots of material go on the inside of the box trailers. Gathering the proper tags to be giving to the shipping  lead
good,The company isn't bad just some of the management you have to deal with inn my plant plus the hours are never set and can always change so not very much planning.
good,"good people and hard to advance to other shifts."
good,"Pas suffisamment de challenges et marché du mobilier de bureau en perte de dynamisme;"
good,"From the moment you walk in its pretty clear that its just a normal warehouse type job. You start at 4:30am and do cleanup from yesterday and then get sorted to your sections."
good,"I've worked for steelcase for 10 years and the management has always changed faces but never changed the way the company runs.  They make constant bad decisions and really have no common sense and will not support their team, they are only in it for themselves."
good,"Good company with good core values.  Poor execution following the core values at the Athens, AL. location.  Typical hierarchy pecking order based on favoritism instead of qualifications and accomplishments. Great internal tools and systems in place to create the culture that Steelcase wants, but poor management and execution renders them mute.  No climate control makes for a miserable production environment."
good,"My day starts with getting together the daily schedule completion numbers needed for the day and any information the EE's need to know to share in my start up meeting.  I have learn over the past years that when supervising individual's you have to be sensitive to each one's situation, this has help me grow as a leader. The hardest part of my job is to keep people motivated to complete our schedules daily because of all the obstacles that can occur daily.   There are so many awesome people at Steelcase that I have grown with over the years."
good,I have the best co workers in the world. i loved my job and the enjoyable part of the job is meeting and being around new people and getting to know one another
good,"When Steelcase became public the emphasis changed from people-oriented to profit/dollar-driven. Waves of ""reduction in force"" or RIF'd especially the older workers and those with 15-20 years dedication were let go. Much of the product is now made overseas and in Mexico resulting in cheaper product and numerous repairs over the years."
good,The dealers are great and so are the products. The employees like being at Steelcase in general. Its easy to find nice people to work with from other departments and on your own team.
good,"working at Steelcase was a great, new experience. I was hired as a contracted employee. While I enjoyed working for Steelcase, I did feel they saw contracted employees as expendable. They pay wasn't as competitive as I liked it to be."
good,"Some areas of the company are lagging and run under hierarchical systems of management. If you like the corporate work environment then this company is for you...otherwise, look elsewhere."
good,"Values didn't at time align to what the company stood for, the management team had favoritism towards certain team members, lack of career advancement and deadlines were a must."
good,"Management can be a pain. Hours okay, pay could be better. Be expected to put up with a lot of bull, that has nothing to do with the job you do. Co-workers are pretty nice though."
good,"I worker here for 4 years and i loved it until management stopped wanting to fix issues. I quit because I continued to bring issues to their attention and nothing was done about it including human resources,"
good,"Flexibilité des horaires permettant un bon équilibre vie privée vie professionnelle"
good,Off shoring of US manufacturing changed this company so much it is hard for people to recognize the company. It was great working with a highly skilled work force. They had the best in the country.
good,"I learned how to work more efficiently  "
good,Es una buena empresa para todos los que quieran trabajar
good,"Well after I started working there shortly after two and a half months or so .we were getting sent home because of part shortage..about a day a week.  In fact one week we only had work for three days.  I need to have a full week of work every week if possible due to my bills and investments I had planned on.  Then  there was aprox 3 of us in my department laid off."
good,"Was a good place to work, the company cares about the employees, it's a hot environment but your voice counts and is heard at steelcase. Work is hard but rewarding. I hated this job when I first started, I worked 2 years temporary before I was hired permanently. Over the years I grew to love Steelcase and the people that work there."
good,interned for a summer. It had a great working environment and internship program. I was paired with someone near retirement and didn't have a great opportunity to learn since they were gone all the time and not interested in training.
good,i was injured on the job i was working through a temp service i believe everything was handled poorly but you live and you learn i would not ever go back
good,"Company with great intentions, sometimes falling short in the implementation. "
good,I scanned products before loading them onto the truck and loaded the truck to full capacity. when I unloaded trucks I scanned the products in and stored them in the warehouse
good,The company has changed so much since I was employed there so I can't review the company with any type of accuracy.  It was a great place to work when I was there.
good,"Steelcase has great intentions in trying to get everyone to work together on the same page, however, they have horrible managers that do not want to work with each other. There is a lot of conflict between managers acting like children rather than figuring out the problems. An example was when a problem occurred between me and my coworker at steelcase, the manager interfered and joined the side of my coworker. Management there is very lazy and when they don't do their jobs, they seem to point fingers at upper management or their coworkers."
good,"I would work here again if I had to but I'm keeping my options open.  It was hard work and very fast paced.  It was too loud for me, the machines made a lot of noise"
good,i didn't like it because of the shift we worked you never knew what time you were going to be able to come home that was the worst thing for me i also hated second shift
good,"Was there through all the downturns, workforce reductions, and financial difficulties. Still was affected by internal restructuring. It sounds like things have improved, but I'm not sure what the culture is like now."
good,"Got very hot in the factory during summer time. I liked all the people I worked with. I worked through a temp agency. Most of the laborers were temps, and the steelcase employees were quite rude to the temps"
good,"This position was only a temporary one. Steelcase, as I have been told, always lay off in December. They called me to come back in February, but had already began another position."
good,Poste de technicien méthode prématuré pour moi sorti de mes études
good,"I enjoyed working here, wasn't a difficult job to obtain and I enjoyed working with my co-workers they were all respectful and easy to work and communicate with."
good,I was a press operator and laser operator for 5 years. Left due to family emergency. Was a fun and great place to work. everyone worked as a team which made it a fun place to work.
good,Its nice place to work in terms of a family/work balance but they only hire contracts employees. There is a possibility that you will be hired on full time but they prefer to keep you contract as long as possible
good,The management wasn't that knowledgeable about the things they were holding staff accountable for. Decent pay but the culture sucks!
good,"Working here was probably one of my best learning experiences, I did not work here long because I had troubles with transportation. This was one of my first real jobs but I do remember it being very dusty."
good,"A typical day at work first includes making sure that your work area is clean and well organized. To begin each shift, we had start up meetings to address any product issues and to discuss daily/weekly objectives. During the shift, I had to focus on the task at hand to ensure that each product was efficiently and effectively assessed. Mainly, I learned the value of hard work. Over three summer breaks in college, I held three different job titles. Truck loader, assembly line worker, and warehouse assistant. During my first job as a truck loader, I learned quite a bit about logistics. This experience was easily the most labor intensive because the truck's trailers reached temperatures of up to 110 degrees in the summer months. As an assembly line worker, I gained knowledge of understanding exactly how a product is ordered, created, and packaged. My most previous job as a warehouse assistant gave me a great understanding of how to process inventory. Throughout three summers, I worked with many different people. Most co-workers were eager to help me first understand my job responsibilities, and assist me whenever possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers. Each summer, I made great relationships with the people I worked with every day. The relationships I've built over the past summers will not soon be forgotten. I still consider many of my co-workers to be my friends."
good,"Responsible for tasks involved in the production of office furniture products. Set-up basic"
good,My job allowed me to work with several levels of workers both inside and outside Steelcase.  the work was good and fellow workers were a delight to work with
good,"job was ok hot but ok,set up and operate cnc machines talking and enjoying people that I was working with"
good,Ambiance agréable ce qui permet de travailler correctement.
good,"My days were spent interviewing injured employees, viewing the site where the injury occurred. Righting up report in Risk Manager program. Righting up report in my database which kicked out letters to everyone involved, legal, medical, supervision, engineering, etc. I would then meet with various people to discuss various issues concerning manufacturing safety and progress.  "
good,It's hot in the summer. A lot of standing and walking. Assembly work.
good,"There is a need for change management especially at lower levels. Many of the employees have been there too long and are resistant to change. There are some really good people that work for Steelcase Inc. however. Sadly enough, the company has lost some truly dedicated employees that I encountered during my time there."
good,sempre me trataron muy buen mey gustio ese company por que estava muncha hente con respecto y salud y me cuidavan sempre
good,Manufacture office furniture.
good,"The management was questionable, I liked my co-workers, I was always busy, and the pay was good."
good,"Good Job, great food discounts, good environment; good managers"
good,Steelcase has a high pay rate but the work is very tough and physically demanding.  They have a great schedule if you like the over time and weekend work.
good,"I think the company talks a good game,but there is too many cliques within upper management and no accountability. Transparency is lacking.  Too much is put on middle level management and there is NO training for new leaders and anyone wanting to become better."
good,"Work place culture, lean manufacturing."
good,"The plant is very relaxed and laid back. The job security is good and the time off is great, but the opportunities are limited and the pay is so so."
good,"Great company to work for.Management was always great and i very much appreciated being part of the Steelcase team.A typical day consisted of creating a certain amount of quality office furniture in an allotted amount of time. The hardest part of the job was often meeting these numbers, especially when the production line was short-handed. The most enjoyable part was seeing the line meet these numbers with outstanding quality faster than the allotted time slot. "
good,"Work long days and usually weekends."
good,"Environnement de travail très agréable"
good,"- able to communicate with all supplier all over the world"
good,"Steelcase is a good company to work, not bad benefit or compensation if you  compared to other company in town. Work is fast pace and lot of stress  because you always deal with people that has deadlines. Steelcase has a lot of good people and also bad once, but it defend on how you deal with those differences. After 17 years in the company you reach a level of maturity in dealing with the day to day aspect of your job."
good,Filling orders and running completed parts to the appropriate areas.  I learned LEAN Manufacturing and JUST in time Manufacturing.  The hardest part of this job were the hours because it was a hybrid shift and I did not see much of my family.  I liked interacting with the different departments.
good,Well for the past 3 months I have been working in a different area. I have been sent to different areas multiple times but this particular area has poor management. Unlike Core Steel(my original area) the communication is terrible. Working in Core steel is wonderful. I have learned a lot from my co workers.
good,working at steelcase does provide you with some of the best medical and dental and vision coverage that you can afford at a family rate.also by working there your allowed to travel at times.
good,"Steelcase, in theory, should be a great place to work. Some of the plant has three shifts and the Benefits package is amazing. It has full Health, Dental, and Vision insurance along with a 401k retirement package and two weeks paid vacation every year. That is where the niceness ends."
good,A typical day starts at either 4:30am or 5:30am and ends at 4:00pm. We get 3-4 breaks a day including a lunch break. We loaded trucks trying to meet our truck volume and units per man hour.
good,A day at work was to run the line with fast and easy pace. I learned to listen to others and learn from them. I listened to my management team and did as I was shown. I worked very well with all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was learning all about the hoppers in the paint shop. The people I worked with...
good,It was a great plant i made good money and had lots  of good people to work with the jobs inside they was pretty rough but you always had help it was a dirty job oil everywhere and the smell of all different kinds of paint gave me a headache
good,"The company is a leader in the industry and there is a reason for that......they are very demanding, compensation is on the low side until you move up in either OP Management or corporate level. Very well organized and represents Lean Principle Standards very well."
good,Steelcase is a fair place to work.The management team is well organized.There is always opportunities for overtime but the pay rate is very low and due to that I wanted to pursue finding another job.
good,"A typical day was 12 hours and my position was as a touchup sprayer in the Desk Plant paint department. "
good,"The job was not bad overall, but the job was through a temp agency. This meant that it did not take very much to get fired. I was late one time in 9 months and got fired."
good,"Was micro managed by alot of young people with the title of team leader. Mary were not experienced or trained  in the  process of producing or trouble shooting the very product they were expected to lead others towards an on time, quality product. They would often get frustrated when there was a produion issue and rather than help solve the problems, would have   temper tantrums and storm away and spread "
good,"i work at steelcase,and i am a very valuable employee, i recieve chips for the good work i do for this company, i unload trucks and operate the forklift"
good,Steelcase Inc. is a very different company since they went public in 1998. It seems the company is more about the $$$$$$ than keeping loyal employees. They have taken away everything that kept the employees loyal and happy.
good,Business casual atmosphere.  Competitive culture. Great location.  Supervisor and HR services are very good; co-workers mostly unpleasant.
good,"Rabidly changing company embracing AI and technology to grow into the future. No longer a Furniture company, but a Technology company that happens to make furniture."
good,Good place for freshies or young professionals only. Lack of career opportunities and work tend to be monotonous. High risk of jobs moving to other regions.
good,"Closed the Canadian branch and moved to Mexico and Athens, Alabama. Need I say more."
good,benifits were good pay was good but I worked there back in 1990 the job security was bad because after 12 years of being in company the just sent there work over seas and layed of employees back to 21 years of service so I guess they were not so loyal to the employees but I was able to have a job for 12 years though just wosh I couild still be there making the kind of money they paid back in 1990 through 2002
good,Steelcase is a good job for people who would like to work long term or until retirement. They are loyal to families and referrals and they encourage people to try and get their friends and family hired.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work.  Company provides a lot of benefits to the employees and is very active in the community.  Learned a lot about lean and managing/leading in a manufacturing environment.  Hardest part of the job was an imbalance of support for off-shifts making it a challenge to continuously improve our opportunities.  Most enjoyable part was a very nice benefits package in terms of PTO and working with, in most cases, the newer EE's and leaders teaching and developing."
good,"Wages are fair"
good,"I worked in a remote sales office and think working at HQ would be a very different experience.  Great benefits, bonuses and quality product you can stand behind."
good,Supportive management; supportive team environment; solid workplace research & product development company. The focus on design and the user is great at Steelcase.
good,By the book. Ultra standardized. Lots of structure and consistency. Really depends on where you work. With a large company im sure you cant expect much but it was a job worth doing.
good,They was a good start but some of their policies are unrealistic for working parents and some of the employees are not the best to be around but the overall company is great to work for
good,"Good people to work with. Lots of long hours, good benefits.  Treat all employees well.  Supervisor pay is not what it should be compared to the rest of the industry."
good,"Temporary employee but treated very well. Gorgeous building with world wide organization."
good,Friendly people to work with. Work environment is very stressful. Management is not working for the people that work for  them. They please the management which I understand but if your employees are not happy the less production they will put out.
good,"Good work place, pay, rate not good for the job and not enough hours schedule 40hours per week only get 25-30 & pay rate too low for the job required is very physical,"
good,It was nice working in steelcase jeraisy ltd..it was good company...there a lot off pilipino are very supportive....the bad thing is our company are down..
good,hard work for a temporary job that was not likely turning into a permanent job. would be worth working if it were permanent with benefits.
good,"travail à la chaine, 8h par jours, soit du matin, soit de l'aprés midi ou de nuit"
good,"You tend to work about 10 hours a day making around 11$ and hour for summer work.  You learn a lot about furniture and business with great and fun co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is the boring consistent work, while it is enjoyable to be with the people there and making money."
good,"Great company, great benefits, great people. Able to advance and learn new skills. I was certified in Model Making and Fixture and Machine Building, coming out of production - assembly."
good,"travel arrangements"
good,Worked for Steelcase 10 years and have enjoyed most of it.  People are like family here but the culture and relationship between shifts is horrible.
good,"The company always wanted a safe, clean, nonthreatening environment for their employees. I feel they succeeded. Leadership has always wanted to provide a great environment to produce a quality competitive product line. Some of the best people and best workers I have ever known I met there."
good,"I was tasked with researching how properties of nature might be beneficial int he workplace. Mostly through secondary research, with some observations as well, I on a team of 3 created a framework with associated design principles. I enjoyed finding learnings from academics who live and breath the subject though was also challenged to make insights based off of the technical approach."
good,Great company to work for but with all there down sizing I was part of it.
good,LEAN in the Office streamlined the job and moved into more database than design
good,"Excellent opportunity to build a sales career. Work from home environment, and good reputation with A&D community"
good,• Classé cinquième dans la première édition du concours international FLY Steelcase REMEA 2007.
good,"As Assistant to the Business Manager for the CEO, there is never a quiet day in the office."
good,I enjoyed this job also. Sortly after starting the desided to move my line to Mexico. The very week they moved the line I started at Lacks.
good,Good place to work. Great coworkers. Solid design and customer service reps.
good,"Great work environment , great benefits , i really enjoyed being an employee the hour cut just wasn't good for me I needed 40+ hours constantly and there production was down and it wasn't possible"
good,i do not wish to share and i have to reach a minimum of 150 characters for this thing to let me move on to the next step. i am typing anything just so i can move on
good,Assembly line. Had to be on your feet as long as possible. Even with all the necessary PPE the warehouse was still noisy. A lot of dust. We had the opportunity to stay long hours of overtime.
good,Good place to work. Pay could be higher. Potential for advancement was pretty good. Working conditions were not the best. Very hot in the summertime. Management was a little too strict.
good,Este proceso aun falta mayor apego ya que se tiene gente que son buenos para unas actividades y no se les da la oportunidad
good,"this job helped me to realize that IT is my chosen field.  i am currently on the black line, hoping to advance into the IT department"
good,"...because you won't get fired. Hours are regular, pay is a living wage, there is a nearly-guaranteed bonus at the end of the fiscal year, and the company offers a wide range of benefits and perks. However, management is glacial about adapting to problems, and despite multiple metrics in place (that time is spent on collecting regularly) there is almost no accountability for underperforming employees at any level, leaving the few to overcome the inaction of the many. Almost all decisions are based on seniority, and there are no official performance reviews to affect raises or the like."
good,Some physically demanding positions. I learned how to manufacture furniture.Management was not always fair. Most co-workers were good people. Sometimes overtime was demanding and excessive. The pay and the benefits were the very best part of the job.
good,the company doesn't want to improve technical skills of the employees based in certifications or technical's courses.
good,"dommage que l'entreprise n'embauche pas."
good,"*hours were too shifty for full time employment. One work week would be 5 days, while the next would would be 3 or 4 days. "
good,"No matter what's going on in the company. You will be treated fairly, as long as you do your and willingly to help other. You have a good chance in moving up in the company."
good,"Good culture for a big company. Opportunities and training can be good for younger, skilled people. Older individuals can be overlooked sometimes, but not bad."
good,"I was a buyer planner at Steelcase, Always enjoyed a great group of employees. Rewards for hard work & a real respect for purchasing department. Opportunity was good until downsizing due to the 2007-2008 economy. They offered me a job in Texas buy we didn't want to leave family or California."
good,"Great culture - great worklife balance generally speaking, but some areas/mgrs are old-school.  company is large so everyone only does a small piece of the job."
good,"I've worked too many factory jobs to count and this one was by far the most organized place I've worked. Clean, and generally good people who work stressful days. Don't expect much from management however.. the zone leaders will work with you, but anyone higher than that, good luck."
good,"Steelcase thrives on change and being a leader in the furniture industry.  I love being a part of company that strives for change, innovation and improvement."
good,"The company runs as lean as possible which creates very heavy workloads.  They are slow to fill job vacancies and as a result, you're expected to do the work of 2-3 people until positions are filled."
good,"Es un lugar agradable, con gente amable. Ambiente de aprendizaje óptimo."
good,I enjoyed the working at the Steelcase's global headquarters. There is a full caffe in on the lower level of the building along with a Starbucks. The hours were somewhat flexable as long as I was able to acomplish the required work.
good,"If you work in the corporate side of things, the culture is completely different from the plants. Departments are very siloed from each other, so your experience as an employee can vary greatly. It's easy to get caught up in buzzwords and meetings without actually accomplishing much. Organizational hierarchy struggles makes making significant but needed changes difficult. Very low communication between groups. Lack of accountability is generally a problem."
good,"Great history of being a good place to work.  Becoming more and more degraded every year.  Not the same values anymore.  Ever since prior CEO left, market share loss and talented people leaving."
good,I worked for Steelcase for a long time and I learned a lot. Did a lot of hands on work and have been involved in different aspects of engineering. The pay could have been better.
good,"My experience working for Steelcase was a positive one.  They are a progressive organization focusing on Lean Manufacturing, Green processes and first and foremost, a positive customer experience.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a chance to advance in the furniture manufacturing world."
good,A typical day at work consisted of a friendly environment and productive workplace. I was able to learn new skills and enhance prior skills. Management was always helpful and willing to teach. Co-workers were cooperative in team projects. Although work loads can be challenging I never found it hard to complete a task. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to use my skills and learning new things.
good,"Steelcase provided a great income for me for many years - a lifetime actually. For anyone that worked there prior to the downsizing (beginning early in the new millennium), it was a fantastic place to work. They were far & above ahead of the competition when it came to pay and total compensation. Job security and the work environment were second to none."
good,"I enjoyed working at steelcase, the people were friendly and the work was fast paced . I learned a lot in a short period of time that helped me grow quickly in the company."
good,There are so many great people who have been there since the 70's and 80's working side by side with people new to the workforce.  They care about their employees and their wellbeing.  January through April is their slow time for production.
good,I enjoy working there just need something that pays more.. good company to work for. Good to their employees.just need to raise the pay... Companies around us is starting out more than we top out at.
good,Typical day at work consisted of producing parts for the final product. Insuring that the daily output matched the daily requirements. Insuring that material was available to meet the requirements.
good,"The workplace is moving toward more open work space, which is not always the best for technical, IT work.  It can be noisy."
good,"Great place to advance and learn new skills."
good,"Work 40 hours or more with overtime, good health benefits such as dental and vision. Working with people on production assembly line, building furniture. You earn paid time off with Steelcase."
good,"-Enfoque total a las actividades a realizar"
good,L’esprit de l’entreprise et la bonne ambiance au sein de l’entreprise Steelcase m'ont permis d'être épanouie durant mon année d'alternance.
good,"Overall SteelCase is a decent place to work, the only problem is that the skills you learn are not used anymore at many places besides the core values. Promotions can seem like they are handed out to friends of managers instead of hard workers."
good,Great place to work overall. Plenty of opportunity for advancement. The down side is no air conditioning. It can be brutal in the summertime. Cafeteria on site.
good,"Steelcase embodies it's mission statement by being a company with a great corporate culture. The environment is competitive, focused on sustainability, employee cultivation, and collaborative. It is an excellent organization and wonderful place to be employed."
good,"I really like Steelcase not a bad place to work. the people I work with are fine I get along with every one. It really is a place you can be proud to work for. I am treated with respect and if I needed help I got it. I wish they had sick days though I mean when you get sick with a cold and you don't want to spread it to others you take the chance of spreading it or it goes against you.I don't have an attendance problem  because of it though. I guess I have to say the hardest part is the parts that can weigh quite a bit at times. The best part is I stay busy so time goes fast. Steelcase is a great place to work. I would really like a chance to do try something els at a new place! They have a place that you can work out as well to keep your weight down if you want so they do care about your health. They also have a  person who can help you get back on the job if you get hurt so you don't have to see some one you don't know, that makes you feel more comfortable! I really do like Steelcase but I believe a change would do me good after all I do believe there is life other than Steelcase that could be just as good or even better!"
good,"Set up, operate manual, CNC 3, 4 &5 axis vertical & horizontal milling machines, "
good,It's a good place to work. Good money (for some jobs) and great benefits. Management is hit-and-miss. Some employees are hit-and-miss too. Fairly easy to get into supervisor roles if you're capable.
good,"Good pay, informative supervision. Good training. Great Benefits. "
good,"durant les 12 ans passés chez Steelcase, je n'ai cessé de progresser et d'évoluer."
good,"A grand institution in the glory days of Office Furniture - Steelcase provided and enjoyed an excellent team environment, great pay and benefits, value-adding work and provisions literally to the world of work.  It was a great experience working my way up from Production to Quality Assurance and Management, Communication, World Class Performance and eventually VP level."
good,"The typical day is what you would expect in a factory, come in to start your shift and leave when it is over.  The overall job was not difficult and the people were fun to be around.  Management, for the most part, was pretty good and easy to get along with which is always nice."
good,It was a good place to work for starting there at such a young age making very good money great benefits awesome 401k I was fortunate to work around good people
good,"To be involved with an industry leading company is to be part of an intense environment.  Every day is a constant challenge to improve yourself and others, while meeting the high corporate production standard.  To achieve a near perfect schedule completion on a constant basis takes a high level of teamwork and accountability.  The expectation of excellence is never compromised or lowered, for this reason finding time to work with others to install improvements is ideal.  Also strengthening the talent of your immediate team members is just as important to obtain goals.  As a manager when you lose site of any aspect of being a true leader rough days soon follow.  On the other hand when you stay focused on the principles of LEAN manufacturing leadership the achievements are very fulfilling."
good,Working at Steelcase was  a very good experience. Working with a lot of people and learning many different styles of furniture was an experience in itself.
good,"I worked as in the GSA area selling directly to US Government locations throughout the world, as well as local and state government agencies.  The highlight was a Project at the US Embassy in Baghdad during the US occupation."
good,when i came in at night when i worked third shift i was an forklift operator unloading and loading trucks on the dock. I also worked alone when scanning and labeling boxes and separated them by putting them in their prospective spots.
good,"Experienced structure work schedule"
good,"The day is started at seven o'clock with a team meeting where we review the previous days activities, and plan the present day. After the meeting we do stretches before we start working."
good,"A typical day was intense, from my vantage point. Over my career, I worked through the company in many different facets and every experience was involved, customer-focused, andeducational. Work days were hard yet fulfilling, processing work every day but also leading employees and teams to get the job done. Also being a leader and a role model, was a good fit. You had the ability to grow employees and hopefully, they learned things from you that will last a life time. Hard work is the equivalent to defense in sports- defense wins championships. Dealing with management was a two fold scenario. If you proved yourself and earned trust, you had full support. many of my co-workers were a close knit work family. We had bonded together through several years and I could depend on them to help me complete my goals and remain successful. Unfortunately, the hardest part of the job, was seeing our corporate idealogogy change from a family culture to a corporate culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching an employee a plan, or theory, seeing them start to belive it, follow it, reach their goals, and then see them grow as an employee and individual."
good,-Long days and long nights
good,Fun and exciting to work for. Great management and great benefits. 3 different shifts that accommodate to a busy lifestyle.
good,"Very nice work environment. Great personal development. Great culture. The facility is beautiful. Hours are great, 8-5 and you don't have to take work home. Good investment in technology."

good,The backbone of this company are the people that you get to work with.   Everyone is helpful and wants you to succeed.  Workplace culture is open and collaborative.
good,Steel case is a very competitive place to work.There is a lot of places to build at Steel case. I've learned many jobs over the years that help with a lot. so many backgrounds and different ideas that have been open to use.
good,It's a solid job and they let you try anything if it will help the company. Human Resources is terrible if you are in a leadership position. They are an advocate for the employees on the line and do not have any member of management's best interests in mind whatsoever.
good,"This was a tough summer job because it was very physically demanding. Although it was tough because of the heat and long hours, I think the pay made it worth while, and it was clear that Steelcase cares about their employees."
good,"Its a fast but easy job, just have to stay focus. I learned everyone is not going to like you but, you all come to do a job. Are you going to let him decide how you work is goin to go or are you going to have control of you position. Stealcase can be fun but its all business when it comes to their product."
good,A very good manufacturing company.  Quality products.  Very much into progressive management styles and treating people very well.  Excellent training programs and facilities.
good,"The company was very progressive in offering job-share opportunities.  It allowed me to partner with another person to fulfill the 40 hour work week."

good,"Steelcase in the 80's and 90's was a good place to work for, changes were made in the late 90's that changed how many employees lived their lives, not for the better."
good,"Steelecase is a great place to work. The company is a family they care about your family. Birthday card, I just couldn't see myself growing anymore."
good,Challenging position and a very competitive industry.  The cycle time is long to close business.  They have very nice people that help tremendously in closing the business.
good,I started at 5am I got my orders set up the welder  and started running took parts and tag the parts and take the parts to paint
good,Steelcase is one of the leading global providers of office furniture. They place a high value on their employees and actively encourage innovation. Loved my time there.
good,A typical day in the shipping dept. at Steelcase involves scanning furniture to be loaded onto outgoing trucks and unloading trailers full of dunnage. We have a great Zone Leader who makes the job fun and worth going to every day.
good,"Pros: Working environment made to encourage creativity: great people, flexible desks, many services to allow work/life balance. Highlight on Sustainable management."
good,"I would still be working at Steelcase, if the company didn't close my facility in January 2012"

good,Se trabajaba con mucho confort muy dinamico y excelentes personas
good,I worked here only for a summer through a temp agency. Even as a temp the position offered future employment at the company as well as pay raises assigned incrementally for coming to work everyday and on time.
good,Really Hot but good team workers. Cafeteria services were really good and the food was great. The zone leader had a lack of what a leader should be about.
good,"Hot environment but good place to work, Training is excellent, Pay is fair. Work Life balance needs some work but overall a good place. Not sure about advancement"
good,"Me gusto estar en contacto con los clientes, fue mi primera toma de contacto con el mundo del diseño de interior,"
good,"Steel case, was always full of inovation. Upgrading equipment and processes. At the same time continuous educating associates to another level.  It was a great place to work."
good,"Aqui fue mi primer experiencia en el ambito de la maquiladora, aprendi mucho en el ramo de calidad, estoy muy satisfecho"
good,worked on assembly lines building and putting together filing cabinets. Had to be able to move at fast pace and keep up with others on assembly line. Very enjoyable management in the area of the plant I was located.

good,Good workplace to work at recommend it to anyboby Managers are on top of everything any complaints they will handle. If you have school they will work with your schedule.
good,Steelcase is a good company with plenty of hours available. It also provides good benfits and good opprtunites for advancement. Pay is based off preformace and length of time with the company.
good,"Steelcase is an awesome place to work and their culture is unmatched. People are very nice, ""dress for your day"" attitude, flexibility to work in different areas of the building as well as from home. My only issue was that when I was nearing the end of my internship and expressed the desire to stay with the company they didn't have any openings. They offered me a zone leader job (non degree required) but nothing that actually utilized my degree and skills. Hopefully the materials management team has solved this issue."
good,"good place to work, great people. it a very clean shop with all the equipment youll need to perform your job. there is enough parking for all employees for the size of the company."
good,I didn't work here long enough to get an honest review of the place. only worked here one month and the agency never paid me so steelcase couldn't allow me into the warehouse until I was paid unfortunately no compensation was ever dealt.
good,Steelcase offered great hours and is a great place for learning benefits. The zone leaders are great and will help you whenever you need help. Overall its a good place to work
good,While working at Steelcase I seen how much office furniture companies bought.  It was nice to see the Steelcase enjoyed making a quality product.  It is nice to be proud the company you work for.
good,I was responsible for production and sometimes painting office filing cabinets and desks for the workplace.these products were then shipped around the world.i learned different skills that were new to me such as welding and table saw
good,"A great company to work for with a good culture, wonderful facilities, and friendly management. They are willing to put their money where their mouth is in support of new products and ideas."
good,Steelcase was a great place to work. Everyone got along and we all pitched in to help each other with deadlines. We all trained the new trainees coming in.
good,Good company they have a lot of very good management people they keep the facility very clean and looking good. I think they should not be so greedy and have a lot let temp employees.
good,"Steelcase is a good place to work , most of the management is very nice to work with and will work with you .  Veey stable and overall a good place to work."
good,I was a Temporary employee while at Steelcase Inc.  While I worked there they were very happy with the fact that I would come in earlier than others and really wanted to do the job
good,I did my internship and worked in two other areas as well while I was at Steelcase Inc.  While I worked there Steelcase was seemed very detailed-oriented  and deadline driven but things weren't overly stressful.
good,"OK PLACE to work fast paced the people are fun , they always think of there workers and bring food in for there workers to eat pizza barbecue etc.  Nice people"

good,Excelente empresa para iniciar tu carrera profesional. Excelente ambiente laboral y excelente trato con el personal. Buenas areas de crecimiento y oportunidad.
good,"I work anywhere from 8-9 hours Monday-Friday. I've learn how to operate driving equipment over the last 4 years. Also I've worked on the shipping/receiving docks. Management at Steelcase can be very much improved in my opinion. I enjoy working with my co-workers we help each other out when needed, but at times they're a few that don't carry they're weight. The hardest part of my job is having to find and get product from lines to the docks depending on the lines and work schedule."
good,"Paid a generous buy-out upon plant closure. I cannot say any thing bad about Steel case Canada Inc.. We were required to move about the plant on the afternoon shift filling production schedules. I did fabrication jobs such as assembly, upholstery, and welding. I was required to 'pack' and check order labels for shipment"
good,I have worked at Steelase for 16 years. I feel very fortunate to have started my family while I worked for Steelcase. They have been very accommodating with my work/life balance needs.
good,"Most of the companies i have worked for were a stand up group of individuals. My co-workers, foreman, everyone was knowledgeable in their profession and skillset.  Was never really a hard part about my jobs, except dealing with some of the entry level carpenters who have yet to really take pride in there work and fully appreciate what it i they have started as a career path.  As for the enjoyment of my jobs, i love it. I enjoyed learning new aspects of the trade and how to apply myself with what i've learned in school to the real workforce."
good,"Flexible Working Hours, Excellent training by the professional trainers, Working in a team, Exposure in project winning strategy."
good,Great place to work they are really informative on training the different personal that come there to work
good,"I do quite a bit of corporate troubleshooting. I had a recent request to investigate and resolve issue related to equipment reliability and associated work histories in order to maintain certification in one of our Model Shops and five of our Testing Laboratories. I researched the certification requirements. Investigated current state, outlined a project plan (resources, time-line etc.). Initiated the plan which is approximately 90% complete. I learned (and I find this to be very typical of such situations) huge communication issues. Lack of understanding of standards and associated processes and procedures. Lack of documented Standard Work, work/performance histories (No methodology to manage the process, quantify performance or trend and analyze process and equipment/system issues). Management in general were very supportive once I was able effectively communicate their current state and the deficiencies and associated solutions that were needed. As is usually the case (from my experience) that the people were qualified and more than willing to do the right thing. After I had a team of Trades people and Technicians bring the equipment back to a point of qualification and instituted standard work and associated training as needed I have no doubt that they will be in a position to autonomously sustain the equipment qualification, associated performance histories and thus their accreditation. I will monitor the process and procedural compliance over the next 6 months, meeting at least every 30 days with the managements staff to provide feedback and provide additional assistance"
good,I enjoyed working at Texas Roadhouse its a fun work place enviroment.
good,My day at steelcase starts with a meeting where I learn where my assignment is for the day. The hardest thing about my job it the weather because I load trucks .

good,Steelcase is a nice place to work. They try their best to work with school schedules and other things. The hardest part about working there is the heat.
good,"The company and people are great."
good,"Love this company, everything's great, too comfortable, hence it is not good for new joiners/fresh graduates who need to grow aggressively."
good,"Steelcase seems to be working hard to improve the quality of life issues in the workplace, but there are just certain things they won't address. Such as management issues. If management doesn't care, why would the employees?"
good,"Steelcase is a good manufacturing company to work for.  The pay is descent, the benefits are good, and the 401 retirement is good."
good,Entreprise sérieuse et très bien organisée (mise en place lean manufacturing).
good,"I learned a lot woking at Steelcase, the most important thing I learned is you basically got paid and advancement was generally based on what you knew. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was different every day, you never knew what you were going to find waiting for you."

good,The culture of the company is great.  Very much team oriented where your preformance depends of the rest of the team.The only reason why I am looking for a change is because I would like to change into HR field.  Working with so many HR leaders I gain tremendous amout of interest in HR.
good,Steelcase is definitely a GREAT place to work if you're looking for personal growth.

good,"The negative reviews you see on here about no job advancement are people you just don't put in the effort to grow. If you work hard and continue to network people notice and are more than willing to help you grow within the company. People expect to just be handed better opportunities and I don't know any company that does that. I came into steelcase two years ago in one of the plants and with hard word and a ton of networking I got a great job at headquarters. Management loves to see people who want to grow and continue to learn. I can't say enough about the help I have gotten from many high level leaders. They have taken the time to mentor me and push me to continue to grow. I am someone who never finished college but if you work hard and prove you want to learn they will help you grow. Benefits are decent, bonuses have been great, and vacation time is great. I have had many opportunities to leave for other jobs since I started working at steelcase where the pay would have been better but the opportunity to grow and the people here make me want to stay."
