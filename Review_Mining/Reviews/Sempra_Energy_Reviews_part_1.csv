rating,review
bad,Awful place to work. Poor management. They hired but did not have enough work. They treat consultants terribly. Would not recommend this company. They are not an environmentally good company to work for.
bad,"High stress, high pressure work environment. With significant micro-managing.  Cut-throat culture, where favorites are treated well at the expense of others."
bad,"The organization likes to name drop and position themselves as a top leader in the field by how many high level people they can get to endorse the company. Complaints about management get ignored or swept under the rug and told to deal with it or leave. Will not and did not provide job training for the ""Sempra way"" and penalized employees for it during review time. Integrity and doing the right thing should not be in their mission/vision because it doesn't fit their culture."
bad,"Flexible hours. Lots of work to caught upon. Do a good job, be friendly and professional.Bring your experiences to the table to help improve your dept."
bad,"Negative unprofessional employees allowed to be in charge "
bad,Very Poor Management.  The coaching skills are non existent and it reflects in the handling of day to day and long time planning for personnel.  More growth opportunities needed.
good,People who work with company for 15-20 years still have to work until 12 at night to meet deadlines. No respect for long term employees. Bank reconciliation department extremely understaffed.
good,Overall the Company was a good company to work for. Throughut my career the company was fair and offered great opportunities
good,"Work load is manageable, but the company invests too much in acquiring license for heavy duty product suits and ends up running tech refresh projects evry other year."
good,"Sempra is your typical corporate america type of company, I can sum it up very simply by stating that there was no justified reason of my lay off, the reason was I spoke out over a bad decision from management, that is all it took."
good,"My job is exciting, interesting and constantly evolving. No problems there. Pay and benefits great. Most employees are career employees. Leadership is the problem. Cannot understand how the supervisors got their role and how they keep it. No guidance and direction but plenty of blaming when you mess up. The reason there was no guidance was because the wrong people are in leadership roles. They know how to pacify the director but have zero people skills. They think saying hello to the employees in the morning makes them ""people persons."" Takes forever for a decision to be made. They are outsourcing everything like payroll, I.T., and soon to be billing."
good,"I needed a job real bad at the time. I was living in Fullerton, and took to train to San Diego and back every day."
good,"Sempra is well-established in the infrastructure space and generally treats its employees well financially.  The dress is business-casual and the culture is semi-formal.  The company is generally well-managed, but can be political."
good,Work atmosphere was decent. Most employees that I worked with felt as if their job was never secure.
good,Good company to work for but like any company there can be a ridiculous amounts of politics is some groups which made me leave the company. Hopefully HR does somethign about it.
good,"Mid-level management and below tends to actually address the needs of the business and focus on putting out ""fires and/or cleaning up the mess"", whereas leadership is thoughtful and intelligent though too oftentimes is disconnected from the ""reality of the business"" and  push personal agendas to the detriment of the business."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Positions vary by what manager you get. Seems like opportunities for advancement are more limited than working for a financial service firm. Work life balance is pretty much there.
good,"It was great working here , but there really is low chance of you getting hired on because they would rather keep you as a contracted employee with no benefits so they can get rid of you at anytime."
good,"Sempra is great for work life balance but it provides very little room for creativity or advancement."
good,Good place to work with very good bonus structure. Management changes did occur frequently and that was the only time that advancement could occur. I would say it is a solid environment.
good,"Good company to work for depending on the department and team. The company is basically an good old boy network. In most cases, you need to know the right people in order to succeed and grow."
good,"Large energy industry company with various technology solutions in place.  Typical large corporation with many different divisions, departments and teams to contribute in."
good,Sempra has a strong team when it comes to technical in house support
good,"Management is competent and acts with the highest level of integrity but pays lips service to succession/career development."
good,Its a good place to work.  Its hard to  move up.  They will keep you in the same position until they absolutely have to move you up and it takes many years.
good,The job was fun due to the friendly and safe environment. Colleagues and supervisors were helpful and friendly. They were very understanding and supportive. Allows personal and professional growth. Work got a little repetitive sometimes.
good,Working for Sempra was great but I felt my Manager did not really have time or care about employee development. I guess it is really tough managing a team when you do not live in the same City.
good,Mid size energy firm with focus on growht in new markets and regions.
good,"I was specifically hired for a project not to exceed 1 year. "
good,"This company offers plenty of job security and is also located in a brand new building in downtown San Diego, next to the Padres stadium."
good,The Job work/Life balance was bad. No development opportunities within the company. But is a good company with great management.
good,great company with great benefits and room for advancement
good,"Good company to work for - strong employee workforce and lots of community engagement.  Management is older, so there is a strong hierarchical culture."
good,"This is a fast pace, very competitive company to work for with great benefits, but lacks opportunity for growth and advancement. It is a young high tech working culture with high competition."
good,I've enjoyed my time with Sempra.  There treatment of employees is excellent.  The mission is well known and repeated so we all remember our responsibilities in order to meet the mission.
good,"Sempra is a well-run company always aiming to do better internally. The management is exceptionally smart and willing to be flexible. They rotate the top people every couple of years. I left because I had a terrible boss in middle management and no opportunity to grow or advance. That is an anomaly and not the norm. "
good,"> Management is somewhat disjointed in that personnel assignments are sometime random and employees are not communicated with before assignments are made.  "
good,"As a contract developer I found Sempra a great place to work, twice. They were respectful, demanding but clear on what they want. Once known, I was given more freedom and less direction which was beneficial to both Sempra and me as a developer. I was allowed to learn new skills in order to research areas (CDR) there was no local knowledge at the time."
good,"I was consultant at Sempra Energy trading, culture and work was excellent apart from we need to support delivering IT solutions to traders. Had fun working and good opportunities."
good,"nice place to work ."
good,The Gas Company Tower was a good place to work the people were friendly and respectful.  Work was not hard but there was lot of it.
good,Sempra is a nice place to work with good management and good work life balance. The management is very co operative and understanding. I learnt a lot from the experience in Sempra
good,"Company has a strong track record of success. The culture is a mix between a utility mindset (job is practically guaranteed, no need to go above and beyond) and innovative (driving change, exploring new business models)."
good,Great one year contract great folks I worked with nice work life balance. Everyone was nice and helpful on the job and made some good friends in a short time.
good,great place to learn and grow.  Lots of ways to move around.  Many people are willing to help. Great environment and vibe. Large company feel with lots of options
good,Great I had a fun time definitely has some room for improvement wish they had more work sometimes new clear path for career advancement.. Needs more to do. culture is fine a little to big for my taste. there are some very helpful people who work there.
good,"Excellent company when I was there. Good benefits, interesting work, career opportunities, and excellent management team. Enjoyed every minute there and would go back in a minute."
good,"Typical day involves reimaging and upgrading desktop/laptops and deliver and setup to user."
good,Good place to work. It is. It really is. How many sentences do I need here?
good,"Great Place to work, very smart and dedicated co-workers. Would recommend company to anyone considering."
good,"Every day has something new, fires to put out and interesting projects to manage.  The wide variety of work, the interaction with the various support departments and the public/customers insures that things never get dull."
good,"Very good work culture. I learned more professionalism and interactive skills. The management is very professional. The coworkers have always been very cooperative. It was always enjoyable to work, because of highly professional culture."
good,working at sempra to sum it up was a joy forever my days at sempra was balanced by how i went about my performance day to day completing projects was a managing experience fueled by coordination and response time with the help of my co-worker when a stock order arrives in the morning using avaries dollies to sort it out can be hard sometimes. i enjoy sempra's passion they had a certain class (taste) that was a good experience
good,"Great company, innovators in the energy industry. Fast growing and will to explore new ways of doing business. Very high performance company. Very structured corporate culture."
good,Corporate America atmosphere. Very separated departments but overall great employees and low key. Never any problems with IT support or HR support ever.
good,"Prepared and administered contracts"
good,"I have gained an internship experience as a Business Analyst at Sempra Energy in summer 2014. I enjoyed all aspects of my job, my favorite stage of a project being - actively participating in discussions with the Business Unit Leader to understand his or her business objectives."
good,"The energy industry is undergoing a significant change with growth of rooftop solar, customer choice and implementation of new technologies.  Company has good people dedicated to providing good service."
good,Sempra is one of the best places to work for a reason in that they take care of their employees and foster a very professional and friendly culture.
good,"The job was very well planned out, every day had its own safety rules and helpful tips, and every day had its own incentives to make everyone perform as best as possible."
good,"Sempra is the typical corporate America type of company, great company to work for if you're in part of the ""in"" group. Company is well established, but can be political."
good,I have nothing to add to the overall summary.  Obviously my time with the company and its predecessor and up until retirement serves as evidence of a very positive experience.
good,"I start my work day by reading about security news and changes that can impact for client services, after i have to check the week planning and the next clients projects."
good,"Excellent company overall but will NOT train employees in modern or advanced tech. Seems to be locked into COBOL and the IBM mainframe."
good,A very strong culture of integrity and professionalism.
good,"Sempra Energy allowed an opportunity to learn and see things at a high level, from a bird's eyes' perspective, as opposed to seeing only a piece of the pie."
good,"I worked at the Sempra office in Houston, where I had a well balanced home/work life.  The tmosphere was always warm and receptive, the clients I served were smart, and considerate, respectful and patient. I loved every minute tht I was at work!!! I have never seen so much kind, consideate, friendly and understanding people in one setting!  Social activities, as well as community activties were always at the forefront. I loved working there and if given the chance, I'll accept and go right back!  Thank you Sempra--Briarpark, Houston!!"
good,It is one of the best energy companies to work for as there are so many options to learn about electric and natural gas energy. I really enjoyed working with the field personnel that maintained the SCADA and Smart Grid Systems.
good,Best of all worlds in a very beautiful city.  The enterprise software I supported was the most well configured I've seen.  So technically it was well done.  Mostly for me it was the atmosphere.  Everybody was nice.  Nobody seemed stressed.  Nobody was rude.  The Sempra HQ had a beautiful view of the bay and the ocean beyond Coronado.  It was also surrounded by many restaurants and across the street from Petco Park.  The people who work there are very lucky.
good,"Sempra Energy is the best and awesome place to work! would recommend  everyone to apply. the staff and managers are the best. friendly, helpful, kind and patient."

good,"Great company with great benefits.  I would come back to work there without thinking twice.  This company has nice office locations, great people, and a great culture."
good,"Energy was the new domain to work me for, working at Sempra was fun, I wish i could have continue to work there. Working culture was absolutely perfect. Manager, and Project Manager were friendliest I have worked so far. I would rate excellent experience for the time I had spent over there"
