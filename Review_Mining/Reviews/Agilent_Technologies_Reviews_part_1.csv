rating,review
bad,I got fired all because I asked someone did they know how to make a flyer being that she’s always on Facebook on the company time. I got fired for asking a question that both of of should have been gone not just me wasn’t fair and no one was trying to hear me out.
bad,I am seeking a better employer where I could better put my talent and  skills to use more effectively. The culture and group dynamics are very confusing and make working within it a chore and being effective nearly impossible. Management seeks to usurp and undermine rather than support and promote success.
bad,"An old-school style big company"
bad,"Agilent was a fun place to work. Very busy office, which made the day go by quick. I grew very quick being at Agilent. I loved the responsibilities i had and assisting with my team mates."
bad,"Bad to be contractors."
bad,"Hi, I joined this company in Aug’13 & have seen worst time since then. I joined after working with Genpact for around 5 years where I had great career. Agilent attracts the new job seekers by showing that they were listed in India’s best place to work but the facts are different. I joined their Accounts Payable - Banking&Payments team where the process is too bad. Management has done nothing to streamline the process & employees are forced to work from 8 in morning till midnight & even on every Weekends. Still their work is not completed & highlights the errors. Management really torture the employees especially in AP - Finance process. The company is not stable as proved by the fact that they got split from HP & now their EM part is getting to be split as Keysight Technologies in 2014. The lateral company is running in losses.Within 6 months of joining, company gave me Corrective action letter despite their HR policy that no employee can be judged in 6 months. Managers harasses all the time even on other’s faults. Old employees play politics here & no one wants to work here. Their another cons is the location of Manesar - worst place to go, neither secured & it’s all an Industrial area where you will be surrounded by the trucks. They have worsen my career. I was thinking of filling a suit in court against them but did not do as we get nothing in Indian courts. Guys this is my real experience & do not go to this company as you will get into depression. My colleagues who joined with me have already left this company, I was the only left to whom the company itself asking to leave"
bad,Management by the numbers with no vision on the overall strategy. No commitment to long term goals.
bad,"NASD in Boulder has become very top heavy with managers and has become a place that hires friends rather than qualified candidates. Good employees are leaving because of the current culture. Departments only care about the success of their group, often at the expense of other departments. "
bad,"no chances of growth, highly unsecured management. no training given to new joiners, no handholding. HR is insignificant in organization, lot of  gender bias cases."
bad,I wouldn't recommend to anybody who has a family unless u are going in as upper management...they make us come in early and never know what time we getting off..it is so poorly managed only because they show favoritism in the company. My experience with this company has been by the the worse in any warehouse job I've been employed
bad,"Management seems to have favoritism for employees that their cool with (personal friendships) if someone has a problem,they never seems to get to the root of the problem, they just dismiss the situation as if it never came up. There is no room for advancement within that company. Poor benefits, I wouldn't recommend."
bad,"My typical day at work involves seeing to the production of particles used in GPC chromatography. Coming to this job I had no previous laboratory experience .the work place culture has been great. "
bad,"Underpay for Hayward site, people work really hard but they pay less then the average salary for lab associate. Need to pay fair for workers and need to change how they work"
bad,"I got a lot of knowledge there. I could learn so much from the conference every week and could get help from them."
bad,"Once me regular manager retired,I reported to a middle manager that constantly micro managed me.  Was difficult situation to be in, this manager didn't respect my judement."
bad,"Man was i fooled on this one.  When you first start everyone raves about the work-life balance and the company culture.  But once you are in hat all goes away.  The departments are ruthless towards each other.  Blame game and employee stealing is rampant throughout the company. I managed a repair center and was always fighting off other managers from trying to steal my talented employees.  HR is another entirely different animal.  They are on the extreme side of the employees and very anti-management.  If you ever approached them for advice on how to handle a non-productive worker, it suddenly became your fault and it was your butt on the line for not coaching them properly."
bad,"This place could be a nice place to work if SLT was competent. All procedures are horrible, people lack social skills. The decisions made are just wrong. Needs a staff overhaul."
bad,Just not a good environment. Poor management & unhappy employees. There was no good direction given. When notice was you got walked out that day. It was very hard to show up to work.
bad,"Agilent is a left behind branch of HP.  Its continuous struggle to modernize it's culture is plagued by the old HP residual culture which supports large unaccountable layer of bureaucracy that suppresses innovative spirit.  Having a great idea is not good enough and often innovator is intimidated by those who is not accountable for any relevant task.  This company culture reminds me of communism, job security means 100% brown-nosing your superior and learn how to hide in plane site with lessez-fair.  Agilent needs new leadership blood, same people cannot improve its old culture because they don't know what to change to.  Agilent needs to redefine itself form ""Old HP"" image, it needs at least to be ""New HP""."
bad,"You get to evaluate new technology and manage the source code, design and create the tool, collaborate with cross functional team.  Co-workers are friendly and nice, hard working team.  I have opportunity to learn new technology and new programming languages, especially how to communicate with different level of people."
bad,"Worked as contractor"
bad,"Excellent team spirit, motivation largely inspired by desire to not let the team down. Fair employee pay  and strong team values put into practice daily."
bad,"You will get your boss's hint to look for other job once time is up, which has nothing to do with your performance there. So, what I've learnt there is to touch some customer and get their contact for future meet-up."
bad,"The entire company is aging out, but they still aren't ready to hire young, fresh talent unless they accept lower than normal wages for working more than 10 hours a day."
bad,"Cold calling to customer to get payments"
bad,"The typical day in the Company is the month end where we have to do lots of work in short time span, time management and team spirit and the management good."
bad,"Pour chances of challenges, lots of favoritism with the site management."
bad,"A good company to work with, specially in the agent level its heaven. A very comfortable company."
bad,Alignment between regional objective with local management is a challenge especially cost saving initiatives and projects. Having a supportive counterpart and manager from remote is important.
bad,"Not competitive in today's market, claims wants to be a leader in the life sciences arena. Has a long way to go!"
bad,Company is very good in terms of Work Ethic however the too much changes in Management recently has tossed the Salary and benefits of the Employees (except higher management).
bad,Hay trabajadores estupendos. También hay personas con poder que son envidiosos y que machacan a el de abajo. Yo no la recomiendo.
good,"Great benefits, but low compensation."
good,"The company conducts an annual employee survey, but does nothing with responses or feedback. Disheartening."
good,"Average work place with common issues. Reactive management, strict internal compliance rules, many tools that lack interoperability creating tedious work redundancy."
good,"Learned about the processes of working at a large company and how may channels you go through as a process. The hardest part of the job is having patience to get things done. There are some really great people, the management structure could be run better."
good,"Agilent has 75% contractors, not very good chances of being hired full time"
good,"This job help me understand the importance of handling material and delivering chemicals in a timely need matter. A typical days job requires you to, cycle count weekly reagents, SAP transactions, working with buyers, planning weekly pick-ups with the vendor."
good,"checking mails n responding on it,  placing IRs for all the three region Asia Pac, Europe n US on request "
good,Pay raises were slow. Advancement seem impossible and the director was fake and phony. Would not work there again. The company had great benefits and nice co-workers.
good,"I learned that a temporary worker, known as a ""NonAgilentWorker """
good,If you can manage the endless politics you will enjoy everything about Agilent. Their metric systems and reporting tools are poor so be prepared to not meet required standards.
good,People here are nice to your face.   never worked at a place where everyone gossiped about everyone so much. Even the supervisor partook in this practice
good,"For a company with a tenth of the revenue of HP they have exactly the same administrative overhead of the original. This is pretty damning but I started my career at HP and Agilent is not what HP was and their management structure is very top heavy and heavy handed. The products are ok if you’re a monkey and need monkeys to run them. Some are leading edge but they live on their reputation."
good,"average pay. good projects, good work and big company."
good,Agilent is a solid company with good prospects.  They have made some good business moves in the divestitures.  The management is experienced and and seem to be executing on a good strategy.
good,"Having worked at Agilent technologies as key account manager has been a roller coaster ride for me in terms of learning various  technologies and updating them at regular intervals, meeting the assigned yearly quota, handling irate customers , retaining them, safeguarding strategic customers from the competition additionally bringing new customers to the table and designing various marketing programs for customer engagement."
good,"Agilent came in with great interest after purchasing Varian Inc., After 2 years they deiced to move manufacturing to Malaysia. Not much more to say. "
good,a typical day at work is confusion and hectic. I have learned more about using SAP and it's various processes.On the management level they seem to not divulge too much information and you need to coax it out of them.My coworkers are great . they are a fun group to work with. hardest part of my job is maybe keeping up with the work load. we currently only have three workers in the logistics dept and they will not hire anyone else. I feel the most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work closest to. they as I said already are a fun group.
good,Great company just needs more experienced supervision. Management is very nice and you stay busy the day goes by very fast overall if you want to advance there are opportunities.
good,"This is the company you go to when you want to milk the clock until death or retirement. The business processes and product development are antiquated at best, with many ""thought leaders"" simply justifying their jobs and the old way of doing things."
good,"A small company that is going through some growing pains."
good,There is stability working for the company however everyone is not treated the same. Also upper management is not very involved when they absolutely should be.
good,"A typical day at work are always relax and work at your own pace."
good,Nice working environment. Supervisors and fellow workers are very supportive.
good,I did not appreciate the fact that you hourly pay was lower because you may receive a bonus based on how well the company was doing.  The bi annually bonus may or may not actually happen
good,"A very good company to work for if you are a full time employee with the benefits they offer.However, as an intern their benefits are limited.I would mind working for them as a fulltime employee."
good,"Good work culture, being sales based company month ends are very busy and hectic. You need to do three shifts in a row. otherwise good, no particular criteria for promotion"
good,Very good culture and employee friendly policies. I would recommend young and engineering freshers to start their career with company like Agilent. Not to forget the roots  (Spun off from HP)
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy agradable, aunque es muy difícil conseguir un contrato indefinido o promociones dentro de la empresa"
good,very enjoyable work place. not a co-operative management. How to approach a new customers and how to do toubleshoot for the systems i learned over there.
good,"Need uderstand deparment and job scope."
good,"In the department I was in, there was not an ounce of HP Way left. I'm sure it's there within the company somewhere.....just not in CAG Marketing!!"
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, baseado em diretrizes claras de desempenho e desenvolvimento, promovendo liberdade e capacitação para o empregado desenvolver suas atividades individualmente e em grupo."
good,"Agilent, now Keysight, has long dominated the high frequency electronics test and measurement industry in the USA and worldwide.  Electronic Test & Measurement instrumentation was the initial focus of the corporation and HP computers were originally developed explicitly to control their instruments in order to sequence through measurement steps and retrieve and analyze test data.  These computers were designed specifically for this purpose along with their custom CPUs and proprietary operating system HP BASIC, which was also the programming language.  Their printer business, similarly, was created to provide printed output capabilities to support reporting and graphing of test results - this started with pen plotter machines and ultimately produced laser-jet and finally ink-jet technologies.  All the computing and printing technologies were byproducts of the need to facilitate automated test and measurement systems. "
good,"Company is doing well with their chromatography products and much focus is placed on its research and development."
good,Company too large and it affected the ability to work outside the box.  With that said I was not challenged enough.  Not a lot of room for new ideas and process improvement.
good,"•	Monitoring tickets related to any of the applications"
good,"Agilent prides itself on being ""the best place to work"" but doesn't actually value employees as humans, but rather as figures on a ledger. They were awfully cheap for being a billion-dollar company"
good,"Typical Day at work:  Sales Prospecting, Sales calls, Customer quotes. Traveling every week.  Flying and driving to remote locations."
good,Agilent was a good place to work. The company is the market leader in many of its product lines which made sales easier. The company is well know and the name will get you into any discussion.
good,"It was busy, talking to Cost Accounting Managers and R&D engineers. I learned a lot about how the manufacturing process works and how to communicate with engineers."
good,I have learnt in this company to improve my skills and professional behaviour. its a good company for a good learning professionals. Company provide many types of facilities to improve skills of their employees.
good,"Agilent Technologies is one of the great place to work.I have almost completed 5 years in this organisation.Agilent gives flexible work culture, which help us to balance our professional and personal life."
good,Great job which involves sales of chemical analysis equipment. The job entails calls and faxes to get service contracts. For the equipment that we sell and make the quota each month for total revenue.
good,"Finance Expert, Manesar "
good,I was a temp to hire.It always felt like there was only a  small chance of being hired after your contract.
good,"Pros – Good culture, that still has the heritage from the old HP-way (Agilent was originally a spin-off from HP) and good benefits. Work-life balance is also OK"
good,"I was contracted to work at Agilent through Spherion agency.  Really enjoyed the work required of my position.  However, sometimes it was difficult to feel like part of the ""Agilent"" team since the contractors were looked as ""outsiders""."
good,Company was broken into several small companies which created more volatility.
good,"Web Producer working with a global, cross-functional team of marketing stakeholders, designers and coders delivering and managing a Fortune 500 global website that provides effective worldwide e-marketing, e-commerce programs and product pages and support for an expanding group of products.  Routinely met the company strategic goals of greater brand awareness, increased product sales and higher customer retention."
good,"Was working as consultant at offsite. "
good,learned a lot of new things about work . co-workers are ok. godd benefits to all employee.
good,RF - IF equipment primarily. Learned quite a bit about metrology. Management has really got to get in touch with supporting workers needs to complete tasks. Lack of support from management is the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job is personal satisfaction from solving complex electronic problems.
good,"Depends on the manager, some have favouritism. Insufficient training and inconsistency in dealing with situations. "
good,"De beaux locaux avec la technologie dernier cri, un management accessible, tout le monde se tutoie, les relations entre employés sont très agréables. Les valeurs de l'entreprise sont bien appliquées par tout le monde, les conditions de travail sont agréables de façon générale. "
good,"They overutilized the temporary workforce during an increasingly busy business cycle, and things got stressful for some of the longer term employees...."
good,"Agilent likes you if you have a bio, chemistry or some other kind of science background. They also like secondary (masters or higher) degrees. If you are a PhD, you will be fine. If you are not, better plan your networking strategy and get some recommendations to go back to school! "
good,"Ambiente stimolante e competitivo,"
good,"High energy, aggressive company. Very flexible work schedule. Was able to work from home on Fridays which really helped with my commute. People are really nice and helpful. Loved the people.Beautiful campus in Santa Clara. Great on- site cafeteria, volleyball court, & gym. Starbucks in the lobby. Lots of free parking."
good,"What I learned by working at the HQ of a global size company..."
good,First Organization of Career so cannot compare with outside world.
good,"I have seen a lot of changes as Agilent with regards to how the employees are treated, and none of the changes are good.  They are striving to be a mediocre company with mediocre pay, but they want top-notch engineers.  Good luck with that."
good,"Work day started with engineer order requests and appointment set up for customers needing repair or maintenance.  Encouragement throughout the day to advance ones self through education or certification.  Big problem was the change in management, where a unqualified person was assigned to manage the unit but instead, was unfamiliar with the process, and eventually had persons fired or let go because they did not agree with their process."
good,"productive and fun workplace with ping pong table"
good,"I learned a lot about telecom billing.  Enjoyed learning a new thing and the person I was working with. There was not much direction, and the billing system did not have accurate information."
good,"The variety of work assignments for this position made it an interesting and dynamic job.  There was always something new to learn and manage, whether it was information driven or technology driven.  The diversity of assignments and the opportunity to work with a global team made it a great experience."
good,"This is nice company for those who wanted to relieve there nerves.."
good,good maganer and cooprative collegues .
good,"Agilent is a good company, only that it doesn't offer salary hike each year. Many complain that there is no salary increase within 10 years..."
good,"Sadly many small company benefits lost when bought out, but still a great company for those into such environments.  Now in a brand new purpose built building, introducing some new advantages and some disadvantages over the previous building."
good,"Good place to work to get into the industry"
good,"Fast strategy changed company and sales have the big sound than other department. So, good work place if you like sales. And for other roles, seems like not so easy to do."
good,".most of the time we were travelling to customer place all over india."
good,"- Uitstekend functionerend bedrijf."
good,"This company will set the bar very high, and will only reward you with more work. Decent rewards and base pay early in career, but leveled off quickly at the mid range of experience. "
good,"My typical day at work was good, I did clean room cycle counts, drove the forklift, did flow tests, worked on automated filling stations. The Management was great along with my co-workers. I did not find any part of the job to be the hardest and the most enjoyable part of this job was my co-workers."
good,"Large US based multinational currently defined as in the ""test and measurement"" market space. Expanding portfolio to configure itself as a lifesciences company. Well focused on product development and market leadership goals."
good,The IT culture is no longer US based. All decisions are being made from India.
good,I did freelance work with them in 2000. I produced a video and they were lovely to work with. Great experience wish I could tell you more but I can't!
good,The organization is very bad in people managment and can ask you to leave anytime even if you are a good performer at work. This is extremely poor in terms of HR policies.
good,"Agilent is a good company to work with, it has very good working environment, colleagues are very professional and wiling to help each other. Working hours are flexible."
good,This was a good job. I enjoyed learning all the different products made and the technicians were very nice and knowledgeable. I didn't get the chance to enjoy being an actual Agilent employee as was working through a Temp Agency.
good,"though the stress around work especially meeting sales target is tremendous, the results are very rewarding in terms of incentives and bonus. The colleagues are very helpful and the company invests a lot in training and development programs. Those in sales were not required to come to the office daily unless there was some critical meeting to attend."
good,"I liked the challenging work there. the assembly work there did not involve too many pieces of parts and at the same time were challenging to put them together. people there were fun to work with, "
good,"Agilent is great company to work with. nice culture , handsome salary etc. Agilent is having an open culture , you can walk upto any level of management here."
good,There are a plethora of really intelligent people with lots of experience who are willing to help new people grow. If you are established in the bay area Agilent is a fun place to work with cool challenges. One of the few companies I know of as an ME you can work on an entire instrument. If you are not established in the bay area Agilent won't pay like a premium company - it will be hard to take your pay and turn it into a lifestyle in the south bay.
good,"I had come back as a contractor for a team I had already worked for.  The work was interesting, and the people just as great as I remembered them.  It was a little frustrating because of some management decisions that had been made for the team from up the chain - they didn't make sense with the technology and skills of the team.  Overall it was a good experience."
good,"This was my introduction to hardware QA test. As time went by, I was able to take on more interesting work. I was able to develope significant VBA skill, and a bit of C#. Ironically I was hired for my abilities with Rocky Mountain Basic (HP basic) to maintain their EMC software.."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, compañeros siempre dispuestos a ayudar."
good,"I found my experience at this company to be very positive with the exception of lack of opportunities to advance into other roles there. I found work intellectually stimulating, supporting Instruments assays and software for many applications including sure select. I enjoyed my manager and he gave me lots of leeway to grow in my role there."
good,Reasonable hours gives work life balance. I was there right after my NS. It was meant to be temporary job for me as I was awaiting for my Safety courses to commence. I signed up for a month contract but was offered to work permanent which i rejected due to other commitments
good,Overall the job culture is very good and get equal opportunity to work on all product lines. However the compensation are not good for service engineers and work life balance is poor.
good,"Liked the challenges and the people. Technically, the job was top notch, but the overall environment was rough due to continuous cut backs over the years.  Management was always trying to do more with less and the compensation/benefits moved toward the middle of the industry versus the top that it had been.   This was especially tough as Agilent spun off of HP and the company began its focus on the medical analysis / equipment business."
good,"Its an established company with proper process and documentations available. Easy to get things done with established working process."
good,"Great place for work"
good,"I worked on automated and manual filling stations, drove a forklift when needed, staged product for shipping. The management and co-workers were great and there was no hard part to this job. The most enjoyable part was the freedom I had."
good,"Agilent Technologies has great training and highly skilled managers.  Great work life balance.  Open configuration, open culture.  Projects are challenging."
good,"I was fresh out of college when I started at Agilent and the team took me on with open arms.  This was a great place to learn and develop my career, as the entire company was welcoming and helpful."
good,It is a great company to work with if you have already developed a career. Products are amazing but internal infrastructure needs work.
good,"	Having 3.8 Years of experience in Oracle Applications (E-Business Suite) in SCM (Inventory (INV), Purchasing (PO), Order Management (OM) modules. "
good,In this company I learned how  to build mobile device  with a group of engineering partners. Also it is a professional technical  development environment.
good,"Agilent incorporates structure with a team environment. Employees are helpful to any need and work is efficient to complete the common goal. "
good,Agilent is now Keysight Technologies. I only worked at this job for a couple of months but found the same friendly environment I experienced there 30 years ago when it was Hewlett-Packards'  microwave Instrumentation Group. This is a great place to work in Northern California.
good,"Manufacturing & Assembly of Gas Chromatograph test computers (main board & pcb board & sub assembly). Work in electro static free clean rooms to test and repair units as well as shipping & receiving.  Also, trained new employees."
good,Good company to work with but only before you decide to retire
good,Great work life balance...lots of nice people...good benefits...
good,"- Innovative lost of good products"
good,Agilent is nice workplace to work where one is able to groom themselves personally and Professionally both.
good,My co workers wee great and the atmosphere was casual business.
good,Providing a service for clients to bring their intelligent designed DNA based pharmaceuticals to reality.  I learned how to make oligonucleotides for therapeutic purposes from lab scale through kilogram.  Hardest part has been the commute.  The most enjoyable part has been to break new ground on scaling the manufacture of synthetic DNA.
good,"Good team Work, "
good,"Learn the new thing on Dicing wafer, nice management and nice co-worker."
good,Very good employee relationships. High talent level. Competitive products driven by technology.
good,Interesting work designing new products.
good,Management is really great and professional. They don't trouble you. a great work culture. Good Salaries and lots of free perks. Team is very good and you enjoy working
good,"Agilent doesn't pay the best, but when you are working on products and projects you love, that is worth a lot.  I would work for them again, if a good opportunity occoured"
good,Great culture - managers and staff were very creative and talented. I enjoyed working there. Bad point is massive layoffs with the Telecom bust starting in 2000. I lasted longer than most but eventual was a victim of the layoff waves.
good,"I was promoted to Project Manager"
good,"I usually have a very productive day, I look forward to it. Also being cross trained gave me the opportunity to learn new jobs within the company.My co-workers were always fun to work with. Actually the hardest part of the job was getting up at 2:00 am. Most enjoyable part was knowing when I was ready to go home I put a very productive day in knowing every one one was going home too their families safely. Management had a few things to work on"
good,"Typical work day was taking service call from customers.  Equipment serviced was HP servers, storage units, disk arrays and network equipment.  It was a tuff job because of all the travel but a good experience over all."
good,A typical day is very simple stress free great supervision very helpful when problems occurs.The negative part of our daily routine is not fast paced too much time wasted.
good,"Enjoyed working at Agilent.  The staff is very dedicated in getting production completed on time.  The hardest part is that the management is not involved in the overall production planning, making supply chain management very difficult."
good,Fast paced contract manufacturing. Manufacturing API for new drugs in trials
good,"Administer, coordinate and improve activities with all American Field Sales logistics services.  Report maintenance, cycle counts and verification of system testing, WIP (work in progress).  Communication with management and focal point for Field Service Engineers.  Touch point with third party logistics provider.

Solve complex problems requiring breadth and depth with knowledge of logistics processes, strategies and programs."
good,"Very nice and dedicated people."
good,"This company is good work for ,because they all way be fair for employee & alls way 5s program and implement the system."
good,I am currently a subcontractor and I work from a home office.  It has been a wonderful opportunity and offers a lot of flexibility.  My kids are almost fully grown now though and I am attempting to plan ahead for a more challenging opportunity.
good,"Emrpesa de grande porte, ambiente agradavel de se trabalhar."
good,"Agilent was a spinoff of HP."
good,Learned a lot. Great benefits. Good co-workers. Lots of employees.
good,Had many resources to allow employees to develop skills and career
good,"This is a great company to work for, however one must be a self-starter in order to advance within one's own career. Depending on the department, opportunities may be easily accessible or difficult to come by."
good,no stability and rules change very frequently. Management is never on site. Peers do not want to help train because of employee turn over being very high.
good,Management was easy to work for and each team specialized in their own areas.  This created a lot of hand off however typically most were experts in their ares.
good,"Agilent is trying to be agile and some departments are, however it is not the case for the whole company due to many employees who have ""always"" worked here."
good,Though the growth is limited in this company but good for female workers as they dont face much pressure while balancing work life and family life. fix hours working.
good,"High work load, usually doing more than 1 job, working on several projects at a time.  But the high caliber people you get to work with usually outweigh the negatives."
good,The benefits are mediocre.  The work hours are long and management is demanding.   Engineers are ranked against each other which leads to a less cooperative environment.
good,"Culture was awesome. Met a whole lot of interesting folks.  proprietary laws keep projects confidential, and I learned various builds that are hard to explain since we where r and d that also be illegal.  Deadlines keep you on your toes. Hard to keep customers happy, our department made it easy to satisfy their goals."
good,"Monday through Friday operations."
good,"Great place to work if you are an engineer and not overly social. Some very intelligent people work here, and it's a great place to learn about tech and complex business processes."
good,"It is a good place to work for. I have learned a lot here. I have enhanced my personal as well as my technical skills here."
good,My job is very demanding and requires travel.  Travel is 50-60% of the job.  I wear different hats.  evaluate customer requirements.  Develop collaborations.  Technical discussions.  provide Agilent solutions.
good,"As the outbound marketing manager in a complex fiber optics test & measurement division, I had to constantly seek approval for details from not only my direct boss but marketing personnel in NAMO - Agilent's North American Marketing Organization AND marketing personnel in the German office.  The German group was highly technical and responsible for product development.  The US group was the sales arm for the German division.  Relationships were not often good.  I was in a pivotal position, trying to augment US sales peoples' interface with clients in the US.  With NAMO help, we put a costly 16 wheel truck on the road in the US and it transported all the division's major products - for product demonstration across the country.  The building of the mobile unit was a laborious task, as was the coordination with sales managers in regions of the US to use the mobile unit for product demonstration.  The dot com bubble fueled the early success of the division, but management did NOT read the decline of the dot com frenzy.  Eventually the division was closed.  Very poor long-term projection skills and too much technical in-fighting within German/US division.  Not an easy place to work and be successful."
good,"I didn't work here for too long, but during that time I was given good training and access to plenty of additional training material which was great. The people I worked with had their ups and downs like most places but were mostly good-natured and easy to get along with. I attended regular meetings that allowed and encouraged employee input and management seemed to listen to what was on their employees' minds."
good,Good work life balance. Managers dont make any effort for your career growth.
good,"This was one of he best work experiences I have had to date. The Management that I worked for was excellent i.e., easy to approach,"
good,"Solid company.  It is extremely large so experience will depend on department.  Great benefits of health, vacation, 401K, stock purchase, etc.  They have a reputation of retaining employees and finding them new jobs  within the company if their current position goes away."
good,"supervisor was great, hours were flexible. let me also work part time after maternity break with pay cut for a few months. team = good. pay was okay.."
good,"The company has a solid mission with strong executive leadership and vision.
