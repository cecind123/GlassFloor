rating,review
bad,Too many chiefs not enough indians. Life is good when you are teachers pet. Too many clicks. Management needs new people. Supervisors play favorites. Like to talk about other people.
bad,No training. Coworkers won't share their information.  Arrogant and humiliating manager and Co worker. Expectations for new employees unreasonable. Disrespect constantly
bad,"Management was never ""in the know"" about what was going on in the company. Things changed from one day to the next. The environment was more like a high school or college campus than it was a office setting. Office gossip and cliques took precedence over actual work. If you were not friends with management or supervisors, you can forget about getting any overtime assignments or having any chance of getting looked at for any promotions no matter how great you were at your job. The best thing about the job was the people who worked with you doing the same job you did."
bad,This Company is the most mismanaged facility I have ever come across. They lost more than half their business in the first year alone.I would not recommend !!!
bad,Working at Diplomat Pharmacy was very different they work in clicks and if you don't fit you are gone.  A lot of racism in this company not a good place to work. They show a lot of favoritism which is not good.
bad,The job was very stressful. The headsets get uncomfortable after a few hours. They have a location in California so I'm not sure why we needed to work evenings twice a week.
bad,"This company used to have some values. Now, they put profits before patients and have too much middle management. I would not recommend this company to a job seeker."
bad,I started out as be a patient care coordinator went to their pharmacy tech school took my state boards to become a Lpht. The down side everyone feels their not sure when management will let u go.
bad,First and second line leaders lack experience and are not effective.  Makes it difficult for the workers to get things done.   Company suffering growing pains since going public.
bad,Conduct research to ensure that financial assistance and/or health insurance benefits (as directed by client) are available to patients for the products related to the program activities
good,This place USED to be a great company that really cared about its employees. It's gone down the gutter in the last couple of years. They care more about money and numbers than their employees . There's little to no room for advancement unless you know somebody that can help you move up.
good,"Management had favorites, constantly changing rules, leniency towards some. Poor management communication. Stressful environment overall. Would not recommend."
good,They wanted you to do 63 calls a day. If you did not meet the quota you would be written up. Most communication was done by Skype and multiple times it was over a 15 minute wait.
good,"The company was great as it stood. Unfortunately it became unstable but I hear that things are getting better, job security wise. Typical day included learning new tasks and making sure that you were to work on time. Most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I worked with. Many new friends."
good,Diplomat Pharmacy has had a big change over in leadership the past few years.  Currently does not have a President and the one who left was only there a year
good,"As part of my job I fill conference rooms with drinks, the lunch room with essentials, make 2 to 3 trips around the building getting and delivering mail, filling copy paper, changing shred bins, helping deliver office supplies, mailing items to other locations, stocking mail supplies to our copy centers."
good,diplomat pharmacy is like some other places of business there are some good and bad things and rules. But all in all i loved working for the company. I really loved helping people and miss my customers.
good,"I had a great manager. I hear not all of them are great. Executives give lip service, but in the end laid off hundreds of employees because of something to do with stock prices. Thanks a lot."
good,"You start at 8:30 or 9:30 work"
good,Decent place to work. Room to grow. Work is not hard.People there is ok. They have office giveaways and trips to baseball games. You can start from the bottom and become a senior manager if you are well liked.
good,"Diplomat's culture as a company has evolved greatly since becoming publicly traded. The constantly changing work environment can be very stressful to some, and presents challenges in developing confidence in your decisions. Management is often away and aloof due to being in meetings. The pay is lower for almost every position when you compare them to national standards, even those of southern Michigan. But, it is a great opportunity to get entry level experience, and there is room for advancement within the company."
good,"Good people to work with. People there are very easy to get along with compared to most places which is good."
good,great place to work. got to meet many different people from all backgrounds and nationalities.freindly service and very proffesional enviornment at diplomat.
good,"It was a good place to work. I learned so much. Everyday, I was taught something new. It made coming to work enjoyable. I looked forward to coming to work everyday."
good,"great place to work the ladies need to have a dress code they show to much of their bodies. I dont go to work to see that. But as soon as some man says something out of line then the man is in the wrong but they can show almost their whole butt or boobs at work at it is ok gross dont no one want to see you half naked at work "
good,I loved it here If they would have not messed with the hours I would have stayed great pay and time off. It did have great family work balance until they rolled out the extended hours for technicians one closing shift and one shift that goes to 7. That does not work for some if you have small kids. If they changed it back to what is was before only one closing shift I would go back in a heartbeat. Amazing place!
good,I enjoyed my experience here. The people are really nice and they provided lunch on meeting days. The fellowship program lets you explore your own ideas and bring them to life.
good,"Typical day is sitting at a desk with a fancy headset, two computer screens and a on screen phone.  Talking to customers and checking on them to see if they need any refills for their medication.  Learned a lot about how hard it is to be a senior citizen when you have no one to help.  There is a lot to manage as you grow older, and most do not know where to begin.  Diplomat is a great resource for them and offers many different services for seniors, adults, and children."
good,"My position as Executive Administrative Assistant, Receptionist and Acting Facility Manager was challenging, but very rewarding.  My direct manager was easy to talk to, very poised and possessed a great sense of humor."
good,"Small office that housed an Inbound Call Center.  In this capacity, I handled high-volume client inquiries.  While the work was fast paced, the work was very rewarding as I enjoyed the team environment."
good,"Work is great at Diplomat, they take care of their people. Work is pretty normal the administration try real hard to create a good atmosphere to work."
good,"This pharmacy team was great. There was great cooperation and work flow between the techs and the pharmacists. Between filling prescriptions, checking in incoming medication orders and packing orders to be shipped out, there was always something to help out around the pharmacy without a dull moment. All the techs were always friendly and willing to help you if you had any questions."
good,"This is a great company to work for, they are very involved with their employees and ensure employees are trained well and very confident in there work."
