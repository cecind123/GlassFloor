rating,review
bad,It has been some time for this job. I don't remember that much at it other than work there was alright. Keyed a lot of orders into the NYSE system and posted investment purchases.
bad,No Innovation. No Diversity. Terrible Pay. Legg Mason is not the best in class company to work for. Find a better alternative. Lacks Diversity of Everything
bad,"I think it's good to get to know your employees, and create some Work Place value. We've lost touch with Value or Loyalty to one's time and dedication. So, overall, I just hope one day we get back to appreciating, OR HONORING DEDICATION."
good,"While I enjoyed the work I performed, I wasn't acknowledged for that performance. I was hired as an Admin Asst, however, performed the responsibilities of a Facilities Manager. I worked closely with outside vendors and building management. My co-workers were great as there were approximately 160 of us. I most enjoyed being needed and solving employee issues on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was being layed off along with 59 others due to corporate restructuring."
good,"Financial industry too ever-changing for my personal security. "
good,Transitioning company in a competitive industry. Management not good. They have way too many products to the point you are a master of none. Forces you to sell their fund of the month/quarter. Salary and compensation quotes were not met once fully ingrained in the job
good,"A typical day at work would be adjusting and /or reviewing fund budgets.  I learned more than I could have ever imagined at Legg. I was exposed to many aspects of the Funds as well as different departments.  Management tried hard to keep up with the changes but ultimately all the cuts really put a lot of pressure on the employees.  My co workers were really nice, hardworking people.  The hardest part of the job was wondering what was coming down the pike next.  What was being eliminated, changed and/or introduced.  Not knowing what was happening next was really hard.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great boss and group.  We really stuck together and made the best out of every situation."
good,This is good place to work that offers flexibility and ability to work remotely. Interaction with good people and the office location is very accessible.
good,"Computer and Corporate Security functions including computer systems security auditing, executive security and physical and facilities protections activities"
good,Continuous change is the Legg Mason motto until the vision of the best company is realized.   These transitions come at a cost to all divisions and technology.  But with great change comes great rewards.  I felt great rewards completing the multiple compliance/  due diligence tests. and meeting the deadlines timely.
good,"At Legg Mason, I was responsible for storing and distributing technology equipment purchased by the company for the IT Department.  I was also responsible for shipping equipment to various local Legg Mason offices."
good,Legg Mason provides a great enviornment to work in. It has great management and wonderful co-workers
good,This is a good company to work for. Especially if you want to touch various systems and/or support groups (at least when I was there). Not sure about how things are today given the restructuring. But I learned A LOT from working there. This was a good stepping stone for future career opportunities.
good,"Excellent workplace.  Supported key high-level executives, business-wise and some personal.  Workload was reasonable and interesting. Friendly, cooperative co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was there was no hard part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was supporting interesting, dynamic, intelligent people."
good,"I can only speak for when I had worked there which was more than a decade ago.  Overall experience was a nice place to work with nice coworkers.   Nice management.  Opportunities were provided but at that time, unless you were planning to take a FA track not a whole lot of upward movement for those not in an FA role or not planning to get their S7 license."
good,The typical day has changed threefold over the past 8 years. Being hired as an Investment Associate to becoming a Senior Portfolio Assistant.
good,"the company has good telecommunicating policy.  Some folks get to work remotely all the time."
good,Overall a great company to work for. Work life balance is a challenge in most departments. Strict dress code. promotion opportunities exist but you may have to change departments.
good,Legg Mason independent investment affiliates Brandywine Global and Western Asset Management have been recognized as nominees for Morningstarâ€™s 2017 Fixed-Income Fund Manager of the Year.
good,"Nice place to work with advance hardware and configuration system. Good Work culture."
good,It was a job to replace income just for a while. Then another opportunity came up which started out part-time and went into full which work out much better and more opportunities.
good,"I loved working there, until my boss left the company and my job was basically eliminated.  Good pay, but a very long commute for me."
good,Once the changes have completed I believe Legg Mason will be a place to work. There has been a major overhaul in the technology are over the last 2 years. The company values the work/life balance but it depends on your manager.
good,I have no comment. I don't know why a review of mu current company is necessary to find a new job. its a good company but I want to leave for a new opportunity. nothing more
good,Legg Mason is a solid company to work for. They have a great culture and benefits for their employees. Management is good but is spread thin due to such a lean structure. If you work hard and are active within the company you can learn a lot.
good,"The mission of the company is ""Investing to Improve Lives.""  "
good,I have no comment. I don't know why I am forced to do this when looking fro. new job. the company is fine. I just need a change. I hope this suffices.
good,"Great work live balance,  good employee training,  Work culture is good.  Senior management is slow in communicating events to its employees.    There was no job security,"
good,"Fantastic 3 month internship. Was great work experience to help me define my preferred career path."
good,"My typical day at the office was providing administrative support to the Planning Team.  It was great working with everyone on supporting the bank as they were the client and it was our job to provide the utmost highest technology support."
good,"A typical day was from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM. Mostly taking care of  clients over phone and e-mail. Some heavy days of processing trades, opening accounts or doing maintenance on accounts. Learned to work very well with co-workers as a team, learned much about how the business works. Management was very professional and understanding of the team's needs. Co-workers were great, we were a very cohesive group, worked very well together. Stayed friends with most of them. Hardest part of the job was trying to avoid making mistakes on trades. The most enjoyable part was the working as a team with my coworkers and also attending to our clients needs that after many years of mutual contact over the phone and e-mail some friendships were formed even though some were half way around the world."
good,"50-60 Calls and 5-7 set appointments per day"
good,"great company during my tenure, learned the business from the bottom up with great mentors.  the job was overall enjoyable and great clients as well as advisors.  very family like"
good,"Excellent work environment with good ethics. Cutting edge technology , ideal place to work."
good,"This company was acquired by Legg Mason."
good,"Enjoyed working with Financial Advisors and support staff.  Management was weak; went through 3 managers in 4 years. The computer system was rather antiquated, but served its purpose. I benefited from learning advanced surveillance techniques from Compliance Department officers."
good,I am forever grateful the experiences that I received both technically and personally. I learned the value of having systems and protocols in place that protect the integrity of information. I worked with a team that was proactive and supportive. 
good,"Company experienced hardship in last few years but is a great company to work for"
good,"I learned many values at Legg Mason. My co-workers were supportive and encouraged me to learn about the industry. I honestly didn't have a ""hardest part of the job - once again, I enjoyed the customers and my co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working with high net worth clients. Interacting with the brokers in a very conservative enviroment.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of sitting for long periods of time monitoring all activity within the data center, escalating a range of anomalies, and completing email and phone requests to run commands for batch files. I learned the importance of working smart and collaboratively with multiple IT groups during critical situations. Hardest part of job occurred during disaster recovery weekends getting jobs back on line successfully. Most enjoyable part of the job were personal friendships developed over the years."
good,"collegial culture, intellectual curious, able to recognize talent in unusual places. was a place where o ne could learn a lot about a myriad of subjects"
good,"My management team was fair and supportive, very competitive and stressful environment was tempered by a fun atmosphere and good benefits, employee engagement, etc. Lots of room to move around and upwards -- I had to leave because I was at the top so to speak and had nowhere to go. HR did try and help me move elsewhere within the company."
good,"Legg Mason Wood Walker was a great place to work. I started out working downtown Baltimore, but later moved out to Owings Mills. The Owings Mills facility was easy to get to and had a gym and cafeteria. Staff was friendly. Unfortunately, I got laid off after 9/11 along with 60+ other people."
good,Legg Mason is a family and family is first.  They have impeccable benefits.   I haven't worked there in 10 years so it is hard to give more information.
good,"The experience gained here was suburb. I learned how to be a team player, improve my customer service skills, and problem solve to create an environment that was fun!"
