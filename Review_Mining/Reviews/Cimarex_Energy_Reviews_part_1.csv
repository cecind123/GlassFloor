bad,Worked normally 11 to 16 hour days.  Phone calls and emails all weekend. People didn't want to listen to recommendations to improve things.  Too many things going on and not enough help.
bad,"I would leave at 0600 and arrive on location anywhere from 0700 to 0930. I covered oil and gas wells in a 300 mi. radius. I was doing well work with the RRC, workover rig, slick line, e-line, swab unit, or working with lease operators to enhance production. The management team was good and the co workers were good as well. I really enjoy what I do but the travel sometimes wears on me."
bad,"There is a severe lack of communication and listening to employee concerns in this company. It is ran by corporate America and they seem more concerned about making money then safety and experience. Rules and policies are constantly changing and their turnover rate is through the roof. There is very unclear treatment of employees and a lot of ""beauty shop"" gossip and drama. The only thing good about this company is the benefits they offer"
good,The technical work is very satisfying.  My co-workers were some of the best in the business and our camradery was one of the highlights of working there.
good,Large company. Very generous with their employees when it comes to food (they fed us every morning). Always there to answer questions. Everyone helps each other.
good,"The reason I left was three things combined.  Pay increase offer, vacation increase offer, and caught supervisor (foreman) doing some shady things that I dont approve of."
good,"I would definitely refer someone to work at Cimarex, we typically work 8-10hours per day and its relaxed. I have really honed my pumping skills with gas lift and new equipment that we wouldn't have had the chance to use where I came from. The hardest part of the job is when we are drilling and bringing a lot of wells on at the same time, the company expects us to bring the wells on in an extremely short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone is really relaxed and like to mess around with each other."
good,"Lots of hours, lots of driving, Cimarex company men were good to work for, contractors Cimarex hired had issues not doing the job right & doing unsafe tasks,"
good,"Excellent company to work for. The health benefits are top notch. Executive team is very in touch with the daily operations and people in the field. I would defiantly work for them again, it was just not the right fit for me after four years due to having to be away from home too much."
good,"It was a good company to work for,due to the decline in the economy slowing down in the Permian basin,lay offs occured and i was one of them. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,I liked working with this company. A transfer that was put upon me gave me a lot of stress and caused me to make mistakes. I ddo not blame the company whatsoever
good,"Love the company, but they are heading into a H.R.and ESH nightmare. They need some fresh management at the top, and there was no chance for advancement. Benefits were great"
good,"Was a productive job until bad management took over, then became less manageable. Not enough qualified personal to handle all the duties. Would not allow me to hire the required people for all jobs."
good,"Great staff, industry experts and management support.  Excellent benefits and opportunities to learn.  Top leadership was very driven and deeply involved in daily activities."
good,Long hours in the field. Learned more about oil well operations & repairs. I surrounded myself with good people to work with making the day enjoyable. The hard part was all the time away from family/home.
good,I looked forward to coming to work everyday knowing that I was going to learn something new. I was always surrounded by positive people.
good,"Well Managed Company"
good,I had an amazing experience working for Cimarex.  They were more like my family and home away from home. Forever grateful to the company for the opportunity.
good,these companies are very good safe skilled family oriented companis id suggest finding companies with core and family values and solid pay and home time
good,On typical work day start at 5:00 am and drive out to location hold tailgate safety meetings and would start construction of oilfield storage facility's learned which way worked better for different wells and which crews worked at a faster pace  good people to work around and everybody worked together
good,Great company to work for because the upper management are oilfield people that have started from the bottom and worked there way to the top and have the experience needed to make the decisions needed for the industry.
good,"I didn't want to leave this company, but had to move back to home to take care of family.  They take care of their employees and encourage training by attending trainings in the lower 48.  Pay was decent but is not competitive with the industry standard.  Benefits were great."
good,"Overall the company is great to work for, no micro-managing, great benefits, great people.   I enjoy my work.  I like that I am given a project and I don't have to check in every so often with my boss to prove I am getting the job done."
good,I enjoyed working with this company. The challenge was in processing the spill plans for certification for the ERA. I had the pleasure of working with 2 of the most encouraging employees. We all helped each other with tasks to be performed for overall reports. The hardest part of the jobs was getting spill plans signed off by the field superintendents so certifications could be signed by our registered engineer.
good,I enjoyed my time at Cimarex. good company to work for. good coworkers also. great insurance. too bad they sold our field in ward county TX. to Callon
good,I loved working at Cimarex! I took a retirement package and left but I would love to work there again! ...............................................!
good,"Being obliged to rate a company here within the resume section is tedious, time-consuming and not what I care to do in order to complete my resume application"
good,"Cimarex is a great place to work, relaxed atmosphere, friendly co-workers.  Great pay and benefits.  Work hours were 6:30 - 4 Monday thru Thursday, 7 - 11 on Fridays."
good,"Excellent working environment, skilled people in every department I have interacted with. Excellent executive leadership. Disciplined company has remained successful in a volatile industry."
good,I worked with a very good team. They welcomed me and made me part of the team right away. I never felt abandoned or used. I had everything I needed to do my job to the best of my ability. If my husband had not been relocated I would still be there.
good,While working at Cimarex I enjoyed the unique challenges each day.  Working with every department I learned so much about the industry.  I was encouraged to work independently and to challenge vendors and service providers.
