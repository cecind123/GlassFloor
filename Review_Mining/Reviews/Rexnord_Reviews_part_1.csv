rating,review
bad,Working long days to get products out. Stressful workplace with excellent pay. A lot of tension between union and company. Would not recommend this company to work for.
bad,not the best working environment. rude people and just not my type of work. hated the hot factory setting and did not feeel appreciated at all. wish they could get some air conditioning up in there.
bad,Unfotunatly I have nothing good to say about Rexnord now that I no longer am employed for the fact they closed the plant and moved operations to Mexico.
bad,Moving to Mexico don't care about employees. High management turnover. Higher management doesn't know what's going on or how to do the jobs of people on the floor.
bad,"mooi bedrijf , maar de leidinggevende maken misbruik van hun macht."
bad,This place is absolutely out of control. Management is beyond disrespectful. I'm surprised haven't no one filed a lawsuit....
bad,Horrible management in all departments ...if you have a decent job do not come here just for pay...turnover rate is high and management spends all day looking for minor things to get people fired....not understanding at all when it come to family issues and no sick days available...vacation time is awful and usually gets used when they call off work instead of actually using when wanted...most new employees either get fired or quit....hard work doesnt earn respect....this place is a joke
bad,Very sad place to be. I've never seen so much discrimination and favoritism from management. They say we have equal opportunity but I've haven't seen it.
bad,No les importa el empleado cambian turno cada que ellos quieren sin importar la vida de los empleados
bad,"The overall job is not bad at all, however the managers have no clue as to what it means to give quality products to their customers. Anything right with the company, management has destroyed fully."
bad,"I worked there for a few years and in only that short time I saw the company take so many horrible turns which made it a barely tolerable place to be. There is little room if any for advancement there. If you enjoy barely having a life outside of work then this is the place for you. They will make you work mandatory 10 hour days m-f and you can plan on working 8 hours every Saturday. The people on the shop floor are required to work all those hours which is decided by people in the office who you will never see out there helping on the weekends. They used to care about their employees and would show it with incentives like drawings for prizes, rewards for going above and beyond your requirements, company apparel, cookouts for meeting target goals, those sorts of things but those days are long gone. The quality of employee has gone way down due to the changes that have been made at Rexnord. Almost all of the good employees have fled(including high up managers) since the company has started going down hill. New people that are brought in rarely stay longer than a week or are let go within the first month or two. The company has become a revolving door that brings in whatever they can scrape from the bottom of the barrel because they have no more options. Long story short, if you want to get treated like garbage, used and abused for whatever they need and then tossed to the curb then Rexnord is the place for you. If you want to work in an enjoyable, friendly and employee appreciative environment then I would advise looking past Rexnord."
bad,"Rexnord is the worst company to work for when it comes to family values, meaning they don't care nor want to hear about any kind of life outside of work. The company's answer to production issues is to work you to death then work you some more never once looking into the inability to manage properly or any other issues that the problem may be stemming from. All blame falls on the shop floor and never on the management team then when things go good management has no problems handing out ""at a boys"" to themselves. Tenure or experience do not mean anything anymore in this company this is sad as a lot of the employees that have stayed through the nightmare that is Rexnord are never appreciated or recognized for their hard work and dedication. On a positive note though they do offer free water in the break room. If you are looking for a good company to start a career with please I beg you do not apply to work for this company trust me you will be happier working at your local McDonald's flipping burgers then coming to work for this company. This seems a lot like a hate rant but I'm honestly trying to let people know what the company is really like once you get in the door."
bad,"There are machinist there who have been there for years. Some of these people are not called machinist, they are called push button operators. They are bitter about this because they are doing complex machinist tasks for entry level wages."
bad,"After 8 months of being moved from one department to another and from one shift to another, it became clear that no one really knew what was and why it was going on. While in the training process no one or at least most would not even now how to explain the process, either because they really did not know themselves or would not want to show you how it was done, with the excuse that it was really not there job to train you."
bad,"No meritocrazia"
bad,"The job is ok but the point system is really bad no paid sick leave , they do not accept Dr. Notes so if your are sick or have a family emergency you accumulate points"
bad,"With Outdated equipment and technology, many outages take precedence over planned work.  Hard to be proactive.  Executives keep the company product profitable for great 401k however IT management is lacking."
bad,"Rexnord was a great place to work until they shut down the plant and moved it’s operations to Mexico and South Texas."
bad,quickly became one of the most depressing places to work ever. management did not care about people as anything other than a part of the production process--not as human beings.
bad,Rexnord clinton is moving operations to mexico. I did enjoy working there though. We made the best bearings in the world. We strive for customer approval and happiness. Good workforce.
bad,"Empresa desorganizada,  que faltam recursos e não é estrategica."
bad,"This company was one of the worst companies I had ever worked for. The people never trained me properly and then i was always getting threatened to get fired until I quit. The job had no tollerance for sick days and it often changed your shift in the middle of the work day to mandatory 10 hours with double shifts on weekends. When expecting to work only 8 hours sunday through thursday. As far as advancement goes i met a lot of people who had been there almost 2 years who still were not promoted and then i met people who were there for 3 months that were promoted. I think it all matters on your dedication and who you know. The overall management of the faciltiy was horrible. There were constantly problems happeneing and co-workers confused. Everyone is getting threatedto get fired. The facility is always dirty. The people also did not take showers regulartly enough and smell really bad. The extra hours were nice though because they made for nice checks. Everything over 40 was time and a half. with and average of about 70+ hours a week it was a nice paycheck. There were also a lot of diffrent kinds of people. There were males and females, blacks, whites, chinese, indians, mungs, russians, mexicans, ect. The diversity was pretty cool."
bad,Always feel pressure knowing that the 3rd shift supervisor is looking to write us up. Even though you do a good job he likes to remind everyone that he has the power to write you up. Its hard to work and do your job with the notion he will write you up. Nobody should have to work under these conditions. I have never been written up at any job in my many years in the machining trade. Looking for new job.
bad,"I'm grateful for the knowledge and experience. Management constantly pushes for more productivity. Enter more orders, answer more calls....you have to be an octopus to work there."
bad,"typically you need to do everything very fast and due yesterday, the company is unorganized and a lot of confusion in the shop floor to know what to do, no training and you have to learn by yourself, no job security, a lot of turn-over, rotation of personnel and lay off, stressful job and people got hurt every time but afraid to tell supervisor due to backfire."
bad,Rexnord is a company that only cares about its shareholders  It has no compassion or interest in their workers.  Proof of this is the company is moving the entire plant to Monterrey Mexico.
bad,Worked there last year. Ran and set up jobs on machines. My coworkers were pretty nice and wanted me to learn new things. The hardest part of the job was learning how to set up jobs and the company had no air conditioning.  Got fired before my 90 days was up for getting hurt on the job. do not recommend this company.
bad,We work long hours 10hour shifts and weekends. Great Benefits horrible work environment. Poor management. Makes job 10 times harder then it has to be.
bad,"If you are liked you will have a very laid back day, but if you are one who is not liked be ready to be treated like a slave my management. The hardest part of this job is having to live at this job because you are there about seven days a week.The best part of this job is the money you make. If you do not mind being a slave ,this is the place for you.It is funny how you can loss this job on attendance and your base salary is 46,000 and you missed so work that you made 65,000, now ant that funny. And if you are not a part of the good old boy club the union is not going to help you keep your job they will do what ever the company wants."
bad,It was a fast paced company with poor management. Stressful environment. Their goals for employees were unobtainable. Had some really nice coworkers but overall management was heartless and uncompromising.
bad,Overworked and stressed employees. Paid well but not worth the physical and mental exhaustion. Management was terrible. There was a revolving door of employees
bad,Management left a lot to be desired.  Didn't know what the company was thinking when they hired management but it wasn't about keeping the facility operating.
bad,They dont care about there employees HR is the most heartless unfair people i have ever come across in my life.  The company is moving to Mexico because of labor cost.  the people who dedicated their entire life to Rexnord  means nothing
bad,Even though the work was easy management made things complicated were it led to my dismissal of the job. The only thing good was the pay I believe things could have been better but once again company was going through changes
bad,"However, the turnover for senior level and mid level management is unlike anything I had ever seen. The company was restructured while I was employed and the result was, well, almost circus like."
bad,"Most will agree pay is above-market for this industry."
bad,Poor Management but good workers who kept the company competitive. Difficult to get on first shift. Poor union who felt their only job was to prevent anyone from being fired.
bad,"Engineering is not making the calls, management is driven by marketing and only the people that care about sales move up. Only want to make a cheap product and are moving engineering to India."
bad,"Rapidly varying and changing decisions. What is good one minute, is bad the next. Lacking solid vision. Hire and layoff at the drop of a dime without regard to performance."
bad,"I felt challenge in a good way, there was always something new to do. They had a good workplace culture. I would go through my work area, checking with operaters if I wasn't assigned anything."
bad,Rexnord.  Being managed by a bull in a china shop  Lacks integrity and ethical code.  Product is second rate and shotty quality.  Boasts USA but purchases materials fro China.
bad,"was a great place to work I thought, when I got hired worked 2 years and they made the announcement they where moving our jobs to monterrey mexico I worked a total of 2 years 3 months my last day was aug 29,2017"
bad,"Rexnord is very disorganized and not a very functional environment to work in. The company does not employ people who have diverse background, who are experienced, and who demonstrate integrity in the work they do. The people who work there are not open to new and fresh ideas and the environment has little to no minorities. The company does not have a proper document management system, they do not follow any process as they have no processes, and the environment is very dysfunctional from executive leadership down."
bad,Might be a good start for someone just getting into the field but anyone who has been around in this field a while will be seeing red flags right away.
bad,cannot say much but too much stress and workers are worked to the bone.  Feels like a prison
bad,"The people on the floor are great for the most part but the company's lack of organization and hectic culture lead to high rates of burnout and turnover.  Management is another planet and advancement is non-existent.  Frustrating describes a typical day at work.  The hardest part of the job is actually performing your job since there is typically a lack of resources in every department.  The company will be moving soon so if the location is a selling point for you, look elsewhere."
bad,"I worked from my home as a field sales. So not many perks. Long hours to get done what they wanted done and what the demands of the customers were. I was laid off 1 1/2 years from retiring, and now cannot find a job. Really cruel."
bad,Disappointed in the communications and leadership. Overcommitted without providing the resources needed to be successful. Too much confusion due to unplanned directives and no resources to meet goals.
bad,"It was too disorganized. I didn't like coming into work and sweeping floors for two hours until they could find a job for me to run. When I did have something to do, it was often that I finished the job before they could find another for me. There was insufficient training and little to expectancy for me to grow."
bad,"Rexnord management leaves much to be desired. Most of supervisors have no business working there because they have little to no experience reading blueprints, using measuring equipment (calipers and the like), or running production in a manufacturing environment."
bad,The organization is falling apart due to leadership issues at all levels. Inadequate leaders with an HR department that turns a blind eye to many issues has created a caustic environment. There is no real direction and constant fire fighting with no real hope. I would never have worked here if I knew how truly awful it was. Raises are minimal at best due to company performance and the organization is fractured as a whole and acts more like multiple companies with ever changing directions and no regards to corporate. The company has absorbed issues and continuously swept them under the rug.
bad,"High paced environment, with no room for personal life.  Always in counter-measure mode."
bad,"Reviewed emails for daily job tasks, Bilingual in Spanish, Shipping & Receiving, Sorting and delivering of mail, Maintained office supplies. Light department office duties. Dealt with International and domestic mail metering and shipping cost. Driver of office supplies and parcel deliveries for inter-office services."
bad,"Falta mucho en cuanto ambiente laboral, comunicacion de metas mensuales, vacantes internas, etc."
bad,If you can make friends with your supervisor it doesn't matter how productive you are. You don't even have to hit your goals. My supervisor only cared that we liked him/her they did not care whether or not we were producing.
bad,"Extremely poor training, and management is very inexperienced at how to run the shop floor, scheduling, and employee development."
bad,This company expected their IT employees to do more all of the time with fewer and fewer employees. There was no work/life balance.
bad,"Match invoices to purchase orders and voucher."
bad,A few years ago it was very nice. Now they expect way too much. Work load and pressure are too much to handle. When someone leaves they are never replaced. Everyone left must carry the load. The focus is always on the wrong things.
bad,Supervisors are constantly looking over your shoulder and questioning everything that is done regardless of years of service.  I enjoy the work but not the atmosphere.
bad,Rexnord aerospace was undergoing a management shift after having co-located two business units. Interesting product in somewhat of a niche market place.
bad,"I love my job, just don't like how management has favorite people with special privilege's. I call it the good old boy plan. They let good old boys work overtime when they really don't have any work."
bad,"The company is really unorganized.  They go through people so quickly its hard to keep any one with experience within the company. They had no documentation or methods and standards when I had started.  The company wanted to move in a different direction, however there was a lot of people set in their old ways that were not open to change.  There was a ton of gossip, amongst the employees.  Besides the high turn around rate, and lack of training.  they expected employees to be able to do engineering without having an engineering degree.  They also wanted the drawings, turned around within 3 to 5 days, which normally would not be bad, however with lack of training and information it was like pulling teeth to get a straight answer out of anyone on how things needed to be done correctly."
bad,Most Co-employees are helpful. But there some that are not so motivated and are under protection of high management. For lack of saying they  have job security of gold and influence to have new employees removed with out cause other than down sizing. layoff is not option termination only. these employees have the full power to take credit for you achievement  as there own. only because management at the lower level risk losing there Job. But hey that is politics in most shop a  right.
bad,"Plant closed when operations relocated to Mexico.  However, it was a decent place to work.  I would have stayed until retirement had the plant not closed down."
good,"Was good when I first started, until the site manager retired. New replacement didn't have a clue how things were and mess up the whole place. Over work us and careless about employees health. Other sites pull no more then 500-600 while we was force to pull 1000 plus lines."
good,"Employees are friendly and mostly helpful with each other. Supervisors are pretty clueless with only their best interests in mind. Management has mostly no experience machining and is constantly tripping over itself to get better production but the disconnect between them and the people that actually do the work is comical. Very quick to get ""thrown under the bus"" there. You're basically on your own island there and you better hope things don't go south or you'll have a whole team of people asking what happened. Yet when you tell them what to fix or why it happened nothing ever gets done."
good,"I spent over 4 years in a role growing,  learning and mastering only to be denied the title and pay for the position I was in.  I sought elsewhere and left.  They did not try and retain me."
good,"Rexnord isn't a bad company to work for if your a skilled labor, such as a machinist. However, if your white collar the company seems to not have as much care for career goals."
good,"Long days, hot work, manager mess, poor communication from management to workers . Lots of people leave, some managers didn’t care if parts were put together right as long as it got shipped"
good,Was not particularly enjoyable. Very fasted paced and no room for error. I was always doing 2-3 man jobs not because I was fast but because they refused to give me help. But there was unbelievable amounts of overtime.
good,"Je begint om 7 uur en ben je om kwart voor 4 klaar."
good,"My social life went out the back door, while I dug out of debt. I worked the 3rd shift practically seven days a week. Management could always find the most maximun complaints out of little things like leaving coffee cups in your area that requires a front page write ups!!!!"
good,Change is constant but not always due to meeting true market conditions. High turnover due to long hours and unrealistic goals that change and force employees to question leadership and culture.
good,"had great benefits and made excellent pay, we got two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch, the coworkers were easy to get along with however management was a unique group of individuals that were difficult to work most of the time, with the exception of a handful of supervisors who started as operators and worked their way up to management"
good,A fast paced bearing mfg co that I enjoyed working for.  Comp made some not thought out well decisions to move to Mexico leaving all employees out of a job for the Indy facility.
good,"When I started, the work was fun, employee appreciation was great, plenty of room for advancement, and pay/benefits were decent. Several years ago, they went public, and now the share holders are in charge. Management is sub-par and constantly changing. Employee appreciation, pay, and advancement opportunities have all declined a great deal. Currently outsourcing departments."
good,"Poca opción de crecimiento para los mandos medios, las gerencias se dan a conocidos de directores sin formar a talento interno."
good,"Most of the Managers are so busy performing their own tasks, they don't have time to mentor or lead their team.  In some cases the Team Leader did not even know what I did."
good,Responsible for supervising a experienced machine operators with union issues at the time of my arrival. New management in place to move in a different direction causing worker tension caused with skill tradesmen operators and management. I performed a Kaizen project resulting in the operation being moved to Mexico.
good,"loved my job , loved building ,but 4 managers in two years is not good. i went from getting my orders out a month or two early , to being 6 to 8 weeks late . I take pride in the work I do. I need to work for a company that feels the same"
good,Not a terrible place to work. I was a temp taking home about 1100 every 2 weeks but the environment and management rubbed me the wrong way. Like the management felt they were above the employees as just people esp. the minorities. Gave me a promotion but didn't compensate me for it. I was doing more work that was skilled for less pay.
good,Was a good company until they decided to move to Mexico. Was a very profitable Company but corporate greed fuined a good thing. Would not recomend anyone to work at Rexnord plants.
good,For the most part people are friendly. They do not offer big pay increase for hard workers. They are usually under staff and take a long time to hire replacements when employees move on or switch departments.
good,The day starts early about 6:30AM prepping for meeting starting at 8 AM and then at 9 AM till 10:30. Then releasing and creating shop orders working problem situations to resolution. Forecast analysis and master schedule rebalancing as well as placing purchase orders. The coworkers are a diverse group that are hard workers and spend long days ending 5PM or later. Even with that management continues to assign new tasks and projects. Work life balance is a real challenge. There is however a great deal of satisfaction from accomplishments that are achieved.
good,"My typical day begins with printing off a schedule of currently running jobs and upcoming jobs/set-ups that i will have to perform during my shift. I then begin to prep for upcoming set-ups (checking on next molds making sure they are ready and if so drive them out to the press via forklift) and deal with any process problems or adjustments that need to be made. I received my set-up training and start-up training through the company and make a strong effort to learn as much as I can about process troubleshooting. Management there is OK for the most part, the front office people are very nice and are always available if I'm having any problems. A certain shift supervisor is good at what he does however lacks some traits that would boost morale. He never tells anybody that they're doing a good job, even though you bust your butt day in day out, he lacks trust, and shows favoritism for certain employees. I am a firm believer that a pat on the back and being told that you are appreciated really does wonders for workers morale and makes them work better. Supervisors at Rexnord obviously don't feel the same way. My co-workers are awesome people, making themselves available to help whenever possible. The hardest part of the job is being shorthanded and having unqualified employees that create a very stressful work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work itself, I love what I do there and take great pride in my work."
good,Rexnord was transitioning into a new building when I came on.  A lot of their processes were outdated and they do not use scanners. Lots of potential for errors with everything being written.
good,"Flexibilidad para implementar nuevas ideas, ya que se cuenta con un programa para apoyo de las mismas."
good,Rexnord reorganizes often and you never know when you may be reorganized right out of a job. Doesn't matter if you've been there a year or 25 years. It was extremely stressful thinking you could lose your jib at any time.
good,"The culture is what made me leave the company.  My boss, the reason I came to Rexnord, was pushed out,  Very political internally and very negative attitudes."
good,The Higher ups in the company closed down the Indianapolis location that had been there for almost 100 years and moved it to Mexico. Everyone that I had the pleasure of working with was a good hard worker
good,This was a temp job that lasting 6 months. My contract ended and I moved on from there. I was pulling parts for kits and stocking parts into locations.
good,"Altamente Dinamico, pero poca estabilidad, Organizacion en Matriz que hace que el ambiente sea ambiguo"
good,In the area I work in we have to be efficient and accurate as when the orders come it must come thru and released as soon as possible to keep leads times down.
good,Total lack of professionalism. The upper management brags about how he was hired three times to shut companies down. He starts rumors on the floor just to get everyone upset. He is trying to eliminate jobs and cut the work force in the shop however there are twice as many non productive people that work in the office.
good,"Daily scheduling of work and workers and where they are needed to be placed do to demand of products for customer needs."
good,Excellent experience working with the Finance and Tax group of Rexnord Ind.
good,easy going they really appreciate what you do for them.i was able to stay focused on the task at hand.great friendly place to work
good,"Tradicional na gestão"
good,Rexnord is a great corporation that is growing by leaps and bounds. You have many opportunities for promotion and travel. Rexnord offers their own medical clinic to keep costs down. Over 125 years of history in the greater Milwaukee area.
good,The company experienced a high volume of turnover in management during my time of employment. The facility was very unorganized and was short staffed of key employees in areas that were in need of structure.
good,"Rexnord has good pay and benefits, but they have decided to take their production to Mexico. Management does not usually have your best interest."
good,I went to work for the company right out of high school and now 39 yrs later they are closing the doors.I learned alot in the early years. There was some room for advancement but they liked people who came to work everyday and got the work done(If you did that you didnt advance much).
good,"Bom relacionamento entre os funcionarios, bom ambiente de trabalho, investimento em desenvolvimentos."
good," Coordinate and supervise the day-to-day activities of receiving, in-process and final inspection functions."
good,"Buena empresa en cuestiones de salario y tiempo extra ."
good,It’s a good work environment it was kinda of far but all the people there where nice and helpful they offer a lot of overtime they weren’t that understanding tho
good,"I learned about the invoicing process, customer quotes, and much more information about the engineering, shipping and manufacturing process."
good,Typical work day for this company was a minimum of 12 hours and did not count the weekend work required.  Every month end everyone was required to work to ensure the product went out the door which was always a Saturday.  There were also people that they worked 7 days per week and thought nothing of it.
good,You'll likely spend a significant portion of your day in meetings that don't yield results.  Managers will be concerned with keeping their own heads above water rather than developing talent or driving improvement.  The hardest part of the job will be getting sufficient cooperation and engagement from your peers.  The most enjoyable part of the job will likely be leaving for the day if you don't end up taking your work home with you out of necessity.
good,Rexnord is a very fast paced company working for Rexnord was ok I don’t feel like the pay matched the work they expected from you and the communication with others was very poor
good,"Fue un trabajo tranquilo, me gusto mucho, tenia compañeros excelentes y buenas personas. Aunque no ganaba bien pero me gustaba el trabajo."
good,Worked and many areas of the organization from entry level to experienced professional.  Rexnord purchased the original Falk Corp when I was at the professional level of my career.
good,"Rexnord Industries, LLC is a manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered mechanical power transmission components and commercial water management products. The Rexnord culture, centered on the Rexnord Business System, welcomes professionals who can lead and produce results, who are motivated by stretch objectives, and who will embrace a business environment which is driven to continuously improve. As a contracted quality engineer, I have improved immensely my knowledge and experience on teamwork and camaraderie amongst our fellow employees and staff members. The most difficult part of the job was to attempt to continue with my daily function as a QE despite at times some of the subordinates, i.e. lab technicians being absent. In contrast, the most enjoyable part of being a QE at Rexnord Industries was in collaborating and working in conjunction with the other engineers and also inevitably learning their function as well."
good,Lack of executive direction.  High turnover of leadership positions in Vice President and Director.  Corporate does not want to invest resource to develop a long term product strategy.  Only focus on short-term.
good,ZGood co workwers mangament just used us for what they needed and let us go. No chance to get in the comapny as a fulltime person. Got lots of forklift experencie
good,"It was all good till they announced they were moving to other country.We had good paying job, environment was safe and supervisors made sure everybody knows what they are doing. They left and affected 300 families."
good,"Good place to work. Nice co-workers.  Company gave quarterly bonus. Great pay scale.  Learned about different types of machine"
good,"Set up machines and operate machinery of various kinds. "
good,a typical day at work was me and a few others traveling to the work site then working for 10 hours.  i learned how to work on dry shafts. the hardest part of this job was being away from my family and working with all of the grease.
good,"Any motivated worker was chastised and torn down to become a disgruntled, angry worker.  All personal privledges were taken away from listening to a radio while working, to reading the newspaper while on break."
good,"Overall Rexnord is a great company to work for with lots"
good,"Rexnord has provided me with the financial means to support a household, but after twelve years I am ready to explore new challenges as I feel there is no room for advancement that will not compromise my time and the needs of my family.  My typical day at work has become repetitive, my co-workers have become friends as well as employees I can count on, the current management has made improvements in employee relations as well as understanding the need to be with one's family.  I would have to say the hardest part of my job is the stress of last minute shipments and the rush to make end of month revenue budget , and the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship I have built with my co-workers."
good,Going through system changes and newer management. Good environment for the most part and generally a safe place to work. Many advancement opportunities
good,Potential of growth but many hiccups... Good people to work with. Management needs improvement
good,"veel afwisseling"
good,Rexnord was a good company. Im not a person to really talk bad about them. They had their pros and cons. All in all i would work there again because of the tough times.
good,I started there filling in for the receptionist while she was on maternity leave. Upon her return they asked me to stay on and had me helping out in different departments where there was a need. I had never worked in a manufacturing environment before so I learned a little something about that. All of the co-workers were friendly and nice to work with. The hardest part was the continual promise of going from temp to perm yet never having it happen. In general I enjoyed the daily interaction with the various other employees.
good,"Working in the International Credit & Collections Department (of a manufacturing company) was a great opportunity. This position included the following responsibilities: A/P & A/R, team supervision, expense management, management reports and month end closing."
good,great place to work in the 80s and 90s but since then the lack of good management makes the company unstable and undependable
good,"I gave my best, but opted for alternate employment after three hard dedicated years to making transition for the better of the company."
good,"Rexnord as a corporation is very good. I happened to work at one of the locations that had significant financial and union issues. I started out as a buyer and was promoted to purchasing manager within a year. Within another 6 months, I was promoted again to GCM with Invensys. Invensys had just acquired Rexnord. I moved up quickly within Rexnord / Invensys. Unfortunately, the Rexnord location where I first joined the company closed down less than a year after joining Invensys -headquartered in London, England UK. Even though it was a shame that Rexnord had to close some locations, it did ultimately strengthen the corporation as a whole. It was a sacrifice made for the greater good so that the company could live to see another day. However, had I not been promoted prior to the plant closing, I may have been out of a job like so many others."
good,"They were really good about advancing a person if they actually wanted to. There was room to move around. If you didn't want to move around, there was plenty for people to just stay in the same placement as well."
good,6am start time everyday with a morning meeting before we start are presses up.... set up and operate all presses based for the work orders listed for the daily  schedule
good,"A typical day is setting up your work for production."
good,"Nice people, good benefits.  However, high stress environment and the company is constantly downsizing. No room for growth."
good,Not very good business moving to another country. Seen no advantages. Still company treated me well while I worked there. Also gave many training classes and help for moving on to another career.
good,"a great organization, good management team, great co-workers, l enjoy working in the organization, I've learn several trades, great opportunities,"
good,Manufacturing company no longer in business. Manufactured roller chain.
good,Having a manager always over your shoulder watching every move you make when you are very capable of doing your job was unnerving.  Call center-like atmosphere when entering orders does not work well for productivity.  Management does not listen to its customer service team and operations is just worried about the bottom line rather then fixing the root issues to be overall more productive.
good,"Long hours and rushed work. The work flow fluctuates greatly, and turn over rate is huge. The engineering department was an exception to all of that. It was properly ran and a good environment to work in."
good,"Rexnord is a good place to work. My coworkers and manager were great and easy to get along with. However, I wanted to advanced and put my education and past job skills to use, but the opportunity was just not there. I also didn't care for the fact that the corporate office lacked diversity.  The work life balance was great, never had issue with getting time off, or changing my schedule around to fit things I had to do outside of work. The annual company picnic was fun, and there were opportunity throughout the year to volunteer on behalf of the company during work hours. I also got a good salary."
good,Job was fairly good. Work was nice and not that hard to do or complete. You had to deal with people angry problems and personalities. But overall it was good
good,"Would still be employed there if they didn't close & move to Mexico enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. Was planning on retiring from this company, but now I can't"

good,Empresa com ótimos benefícios e um bom ambiente entre as áreas.
good,"I have recently relocated to Eagle Idaho."
good,they moved to mexico not really much else to say work was fast paced on mostly older machines I was in grinding after being reduced out of machining which is what most of my experience is in not much time on grinders
good,"Worked my way up from a labor grade 11, to a Assembler, Fit up, Tack, and weld in less than 90 days. Boom times for the War in Vietnam, excelled the company to expand to 3 shifts. This, with my ability to read blueprints and work with the best Assemblers on my shift allowed me to move to 3rd shift. Taking me from $1.85 an hour to $4.65, before I had my 90 days in. I was able to build faster, better, than anyone that held my position on all 3 shifts."
good,"Empresa oferece diversos benefícios aos empregados, preocupa-se com o bem estar. Ótimo ambiente de trabalho."
good,"I worked for Rexnord for more than 19 years, and assumed that I would retire from there, but the company sold us out and is moving operations to Mexico."

good,Buen lugar para trabajar y buenas prestaciones  pero pocas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,This was the name of the company when it was set up in Ireland in 1981. There was no change over the years only the change of management and the name of the company.
good,"Empresa ótima quando se fala em condições de trabalho, ambiente limpo, programas de segurança do trabalho muito competente."
good,"Rexnord is a great place to work. The people you work with are there to help you. I found no instance where I was made to feel like I didn't know what I was doing if I had a question. The managers let the floor operators do their job and very often come to them for advice or ideas. If there is a discrepancy in the data or paperwork, then it is worked on together to get an answer. Not as an immediate accusation. The only reason I left is that I could not work the hours they wanted me to living an hour away with a family. But the company was great!"
good,"This company was supposed to be my career company, but that didn't work out. I was laid off when I was 52 when they decided to move the company to another state. That was a poor decision on management's part. Over the next 8 years they were calling me back continually. I kept going because the job market locally is so bad and they paid me so well.Anyway, their management is in total disarray and they don't know how to fix what the last guy screwed up. But I had a great time working there doing things I loved to do and made a lot of great relationships there. Too bad to see a great American company going down the tubes due to poor management, much of it brought in from overseas."
good,The plant has moved to Mexico.  Not much else to say but moved out of country. The plant does not exist anymore.  Which was very unfortunate for a number of people - including myself

good,"Good place to grow your career."
good,"Typical days at work were steady flowing. I learned CNC operation, bearing production from beginning to end product, grinder setup and operation, production order scheduling and flow. My co-workers were hard working but professional and friendly. The hardest part of this job was learning not to rush the process of production. The most enjoyable part of this job was the hours of operation."
good,"Rexnord is a good place to work, at least during my time there, we didn't have any laid off or rumors about a financial problem with the company, for me that is important. There are a lot of processes to be improved and people usually is overloaded so no time to really improve at the level and the time we need it. Overall I thin is a good company to work, but at least in the division I'm working on, there are not opportunities to grow unless you want to relocate to other plant."
good,I learned a lot at Rexnord.  Very fast paced environment. Hardest part of job were the long long hours.  Most enjoyable part of the job were the people.
good,A lot to learn in a short time. management was change several times. fast pace company. aerospace products in high demands. no advancement opportunities.
good,Business is steady and most employees have been at Rexnord in Lincoln for more than 5 years. It's a small company that could use a few new employees to liven the place up.

Other duties include, shipping and receiving, coordinate restorations, manage customer material, paint and crate products, and coordinate the shipment of finished product.

Replaced operating system PIMS to SAP. Pulled material necessary for daily production. "

good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, muhas actividades que favorecen a los  empleados."
good,I enjoyed working for Rexnord. My only complaint would be that advancement doesn’t seem to come quickly. I worked my way from temp to Assembler II but it took almost 4 years.
good,"Provided education and good work experience for 20 years, Was a great place to earn a leadership role until it moved to Mexico.I would be still there now building a stronger company."
good,"Aprendi a usar el montacargas hombre sentado "

good,A typical day at work is waking up and meeting at the hotel and we all drive over to the mill and we talk before be leave the hotel and have a plan of how were working that day.  The management is great.  They work with you and teach you and don't get mad or anything.  Nothing about this job is hard to me and the co-workers are great.  The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the workers
good,"Never the same way twice, always something to learn and the pay is nothing to sneeze at. Worked all three shifts, earning scrapes and bruises, but always keeping on your toes. The only thing that was seemed to be its flaw was the way the financial mechanics were organized after awhile."

good,I like to keep busy at work. I like to be able to go to the boss and express new and innovative ways of performing job duties.
good,Toolbox meetings
good,"I liked the job overall, but was not pleased when I attempted to leave the 3rd shift. I was told that I was too good at my current job to be allowed to move to a lesser job on day shift. Instead of being rewarded for a job well done, I was punished. I did love the benefits and paid time off that they give from day one!"
good,"learnt a lot in terms of work and management and work culture, that was good experience in working with Rexnord. Management was cooperative and good place to learn and work."
good,"No ill feelings for Rexnord, disappointed in the decision to close my plant and move to Mexico, they did not owe me anything. Was an absolute American dream kind of job. Was glad I had an opportunity to work for them while it was available."
good,"Great place to work where there are fast pace and challenging assignments. The environment thrives on cross-collaboration between individuals, departments and divisions. Key to success is strong personal drive."
good,"Started out great, but the company eventually went public.  After that, all of the benefits and extra expenses were cut.  Lean culture and forced 60-90 day credit terms limited our supply base choices."

good,"I worked in a few different arenas at Rexnord including call center advocate, team lead, customer care supervisor, technical customer service and purchasing.  In all of these, product knowledge was key and ensuring timely, knowledgeable responses to customer was critical.  Since I love working with people I truly enjoyed my time there and continued in my career by taking the technical CSR position at Falk Renew.  This was outside of my previous scope of product knowledge however I was able to succeed and learn new skills such as purchasing and planning.  Unfortunately, due to the economy I was downsized."
