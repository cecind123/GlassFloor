rating,review
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Slave ship it’s sad how Sysco as a company don’t reward us we work 12 to 14 hrs every day they just give us more and more work less time and more to do we run out there like a chicken with the head cut off I really hate working here but I feel like I’m stuck I need to take care of my family  that’s why there’s a lot of accidents and theirs a lot of injuries it’s a poor system in those trailers how do u put 14 bags of potatoes on tops of a case of eggs then we look like idiots when we try to sell it to the customers
bad,"I survived at the Memphis location for over four years. The stress was so much that I lost my wife. I worked long hours but I could not get on top of my work. The culture at that place is extremely toxic. The leaders allow certain people to treat everyone like spit on the street because they make money for the company. They create processes and never enforce them, they allow the Sales Team and Merchandising Team to fight with each other with no real consequences, and I the last CFO joined and quit two months after being there. Their recent Marketing Manager quit because he/she was being bullied by their boss. The leadership is never honest about the direction of the company and if they plan to lay you off, they will never let you know unless you are in upper management. The workload was overbearing, and you will constantly stress out about meeting deadlines. I lost my family because I was constantly stressed and agitated."
bad,So Sysco is mass hiring right now because this place is so chaotic. The immediate supervisors are very rude and disrespectful. I worked there two months and they fired me and that was with one weeks worth of there “ Training“.  I asked them why they were letting me go and they stated because of performance and no explanation after that.  I hated working there every day and I was so relieved when they let me go
bad,Long hours. Will work you days and nights. No life if you work there. It’s like a gang over there. If they don’t like you kiss your job goodbye. Worst company ever.
bad,The managers are ex restaurant mangers    Not professional and SYSCO takes full advantage of pricing with the customers  if your a small customer  $750 minimum order with a gross profit of 30%.  The culture at SYSCO Louisville is terrible  The company has a 60% turn over rate.  No one cares!  No big deal as long as “I” have a job then I am fine.  The pay is terrible.  No reimbursement of any kind
bad,They say you have to run a 100 in three areas to get hired but thats a lie they hire who ever they want when they want and also pick on the employes that work hard but not hard enough for them and now they have some woman over there and she just firing everybody that aint on what she want them to do
bad,"they’re mass hiring right now because they can’t keep drivers."
bad,"That’s the worst company I ever work. Poor communication, on my first day of work they sent me home because it was a easy night so I spent 15 minutes my first day. I don’t recommend to work there"
bad,Poor management with no direction. Training for position left you unprepared for workload. Once they felt you were trained they didn’t want to answer any questions. There was no team environment and the manager was passive aggressive. I would not recommend working here.
bad,Focus has shifted from customers to share holders. They see no value in employee customer relationship and are actively trying to push customers to online ordering in order to reduce the number of sales people.
bad,"My boss didn't talk to me for two years. My co-workers bullied me relentlessly. I told my boss, and he said I was wrong. It continued for eight months. A person in upper management tried to run me off the road. The work is not distributed fairly. If you are liked, upper management will try to lighten your load. If you are not liked, upper management will pile work on you. The sales team will treat you terribly. Be prepared to have many nights of crying, drinking, and staring at the wall. There is a person here that has to drink every night just to get through the next day. You don't want to work at this location. Upper management is terrible. All of their good employees are leaving, and those that stay are stuck for the time being or are close to retirement. You have been warned."
bad,"Horrible experience working at Sysco.  Was hired to assist a team of 6 however only 1 person in team was willing to assist me with questions and training."
bad,"un grand nombres de mes amis qui travaillent encore dans cette entreprise sont déçu de l 'attitude managériale qui est trop souvent désastreux."
bad,"company not interested in helping customers"
bad,"I would highly NOT recommend to  work for this company hard work back pain every day. poor communication from management, very unprofessional. Safety manager. if you like to file workers comp this is the place for you. same pay no matter how long you've been there, no room for growth. The transportation manager lacks common sense, and acts uneducated. But the moral of my review is to let you know there are better companies out there .but if ur a  rookie out of trucking school best place to go mess up a tuck at. u get 3 accident forgiveness before  they let u go"
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for this company They found out I was going to quit and they fire me before I did Worst company to work for Do not waste your time and come here what people say about Sysco True
bad,Worked there and would not recommend anyone to this place. Management talks about each other. No commutation between shifts. Benefits are horrible and over priced for what you get.
bad,"I will not recommend anyone to work there. They don’t care about their drivers at all."
bad,This company has moved toward a churn and burn model. Hire newbies. Pay them garbage. Use them til they quit and hire more. Really sad for what was a great company with great culture at one time.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,You will be overworked and under paid. The president is corrupt and you will be fired at anytime just because they won’t need you. None of their trailers are properly working so they show you how to fudge the records in case of an audit.
bad,Poor pay because pay is based on trucks unloaded and the valuable trucks are given to the managers favorites but the managers examine every post load report with a magnifying glass looking to make you lose money
bad,Worst place ever fo caring for its employees dont know your name treat inferior employeees with catecwhile hard ones work double. Manager takes care of lazy drivers while you work hard calls no pro active to stay in shape
bad,"For a company to be as successful as they are, the Harrisburg Sysco is an exception for a multitude of reasons. They will pay you a fair amount if you do your job properly but it's far from a walk in the park. I have worked at Sysco twice over the course of the past 3 years, and I can honestly say both times it made me question my sanity. The combined hours with 5 day work week make it really hard for you to enjoy the most basic things in life. I have had a lot of jobs since I have graduated high school and none have been able to pay me the way this job has at my current age with no other set of skills. Having said that, it's up to you whether or not you're able to maintain this lifestyle long term."
bad,"it is a very high demand very stressful of a company to work at. they will call you in on your days off and there is no cell phone usage a load while driving and if they call you and you dont answer, you will get into trouble"
bad,"The environment is very negative. Your team members will throw you under the bus, and your boss will lie to you constantly about the direction of the company. This site is on shaky ground. Upper Management does not implement any processes. It's a free for all. As long as they take home their big checks, they are happy. The workload is off balance. They will pile mountains of work on you, expect performance to remain the same. Prepare to be mentally and physically exhausted. If you value your sanity, I would not work here."
bad,"Routes are run out of albany by young kids with either a college degree or no CDL   Never been in a truck before.  "
bad,Worst company you can ever work for stay away from this place if you wanna a life they will use you the old drivers will never live because the have no choice the won’t b able to star anywhere alse so the get the best route and you as a new driver will trust me will get the worst of it
bad,"Absolutely no work life balance, and an incompetent Director equates to a toxic work environment. Due to poor direction from the director, you’re guaranteed to work 12+ hours a week. Stay away!"
bad,Very poor management company they have very bad equipment they never work they can't afford new trucks they still have a 1980 trucks in their yard it's always break down on you when you get to the first stop they make it unload the truck by hand no help they always cheat on your payroll you make more money than manager they cheat on you on your
bad,"Bad management, a boys club, very outdated culture. If you're too smart you won't do well, if your a soldier and a follower this is a good environment for you. Too much favoritism."
bad,"Hated it, waste of my time and energy. Management was a joke, did not appreciate input from their employees. Improper training and advancement only offered to select few."
bad,Poor Company went down hill when Corporate got involved and bad Management took away Salaries and bonus that was given fairly. Don’t want employees to work together and don’t care about employees health. Too much product on trailer for one man to complete and don’t care about routing trucks on correct times and truck routes. Company won’t get better until all are gone
bad,Sysco is not and easy place to work but pay and benefits are decent. Hours are long and change regularly making family/work life balance hard for workers and their families
bad,Horrible in all categories supervisors are clueless will not help you if you need to know something they will just tell you to figure it out on your owns. The whole truck is load backwards and everything is mixed up so you spend your whole day looking for pieces everywhere just to complete one stop. If you are a driver your doing your job and warehouse too by building your own stop.
bad,"Sysco expects there drivers to deliver the deliveries without giving enough time for the deliveries and expects them to get done. They also expect drivers to use ramps which are unsafe and barely get enough working room to do it safely. I've fallen off ramps a few times and reported it to my manager, my managers boss and the safety director and things never change. If I would have known this job was this unsafe and stressful i would have never taken the job."
bad,"Is a extremely large company, you are one more number, you are nothing, they only give opportunities for Canadian (white), you don't have future, only use all you life and they will be millionaire and you are nothing"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Start time was different every morning, if you were to have a family emergency they would take it out on you they day you would come back to work, with heavy loads and horrible start times to leave you with no sleep"
bad,"Very unorganized. Communication issues among management. Outdated systems so work is very manual. This a large company that loves to experiment with their processes. They don't ""test"" anything out they just implement and when it turns out to be a disaster they try the next disastrous thing without ""testing"" Google information on their failed merger with US Foods and their rollout and then rollback of SAP. Don't accept a position here unless you REALLY need a job. Layoffs are ongoing as they decide which positions they can transition to India. Beware."
bad,"Good company but there are just too many changes, people derserve respect and do a good job but get no respect. It has a real good old boys club. The company is a revolving door with employees. No consistency."
bad,"You are a donkey here. Position the truck and work hard up and down ramp Dry, Cooler, Freezer.  When I worked there Big Bonus pay union dues but no job opening. 2 tier union. You make several dollars less but pay union dues like you're one of them."
bad,"employees are required to work mandatory overtime where they have no idea when their shift may end. (14 hour work days, 5 days a week during summer time) while working these hours if employees use any sick days and/or do not maintain a 95% rate of efficiency you are fired."
bad,"They don’t care about you, they yell at you to run which is not safe.  There is so much horse play that other employees do.  I was almost smushed by a pallet jack because an employee hit another employees shut off switch then turned back on but it disengages the cruise feature and the other rider was not aware of that, got off and it didn’t stop, had I not dove under racks I would have been crushed.  When you tell management about they just laugh.  Lack of concern for anything"
bad,"Very cut throat work environment. Everybody's willing to cut corners to make rate. Safety is not big with this company, when you first start they have you to take some online courses about safety & etc. But once you get on the floor. That'll be the last you hear about anything safety related. Most of the temps are usually on the day shift & most of the Sysco employees are on the night shift. The bathrooms are always  extremely dirty in the warehouse. So much that the supervisors use a separate bathroom. The electric pallet jacks are outdated & they have caused people to not make rate due to mechanical problems. Workers do have assigned electric pallet jacks, & new hires usually get whatever is left. Forklift drivers put pallets all over the place.No job security, Your just a number at Sysco."
bad,Perfect job for a kid right out of high school trying to make some money. Not for a person with a family. Job is 3rd shift Woking over 50 hours a week. No home life.
bad,The managers lie and treat drivers like garbage. The company has 900 rules so when you think your doing good they write you up. The union is gutless and afraid! Don’t work here unless you like busting your hump and get treated like garbage. Big mistake coming here. The Classic American Greedy Company.
bad,"As a driver, you will live, breathe, and die for Sysco. You will work 12 - 16 hour days with no time for breaks or a lunch, barely operable equipment, and continual pressure from management. You will be expected to back varying-sized trailers into some of the most narrow delivery environments, in which you will spend hours digging smashed product out of poorly organized pallets. Tip: what you need is at the bottom, always. You will have little to no information about your stops and no time to learn them. And with seasoned drivers struggling to stay on time, new drivers MUST come in at least thirty minutes before their shift to prep their truck off the clock, while also working through lunches, and speeding at every opportunity. Do yourself a favor and find at least three drivers to speak with before signing on with Sysco. Ask why their new-hire retention rate is so low. Is it because we can't find any millennials willing to work hard, or is it because Sysco is perfectly designed to produce the results it's getting? Truthfully, there is not a harder team of laborers than the drivers at Sysco Ventura in Oxnard. And honestly, I think management generally means well in doing what they do. But the system is jacked, and no one has enough time or energy to step back, assess the chaos, and do anything to fix it."
bad,it sucks! bad mangers. you will never know what is going on at all. no communication what so ever. they tell you one thing and its never what happens.
bad,"Its like a time machine, especially the mindset of the uneducated management or ""team leads"" to be specific...but not to exclude most of the people that work in the building.... some leads got bumped up into leadership roles during a hard time for the dept. & they were so surprised themselves, so now they'll do anything to keep their Sysco power, there's so many miserable judgmental ladies & men, that work there, only the weak, unattractive, equally miserable & shady are favored & chosen to work there.... sounds funny & I wish it was but it's actually not"
bad,"Learnt a lot around how to manage expectations, but the workplace overall is toxic, too many associates that are not capable of doing the job, so you end up picking slack for others."
bad,Management was terrible as well as other employees. Favouritism from supervisors. It was union based but they didn't want you to get into the union. The job was based on a point system. You drive around the warehouse with three pallets 7 ft tall and people would get in your way and hold you up on purpose. Horrible place to work. This job will destroy your body. The money is not worth it.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,You do the work of 3 people and paid the bare minimum!  It's very stressful and the management SUCKS! What else do you want me to say! I wouldn't wish this place on my enemy!!
bad,"A typical day at Sysco I would download 25-35 emails regarding requests for invoices to processed to paid on a daily basis."
bad,I was called to an interview on August 16th at 6pm. I showed up to where I had to be 10mins prior as the email suggested. I waited 3 hours and never ever got an interview. I got sick of waiting and left. I was really looking forward to my interview and possibly to working for Sysco but I guess I’ll never know
bad,"This ia a good old boy area, very disrespectful to women."
bad,You are treated like a number and not a person.  Everyone that works here is miserable and hates their job.  No training and no help from anyone in management.
bad,"They lie to you in your face, do not care about you as a person or health & well being, they do not care that you have a family outside of work, they will fire you for any & everything before they take other disciplinary actions, they have two different pay scales for employees that do the same exact work you do coming in the door"
bad,"Where do I start. Start time for driver shift was at 4am. So, you’re up at 3:30am. Shuttle driver brings your trailer and better pray your pallets aren’t flipped over or your TK is working. Or you’ll have food getting spoiled and smelling all day. My first 4 stops were always stop that didn’t open until 10 am. Must I remind you we start at 4am. Your supervisor response for that will be, “just move the those stops to the side and write down how you want your route.” Which I complained numerous times to main office and to supervisor. They tell you they will check into it, then when you bring it back up they will tell you it’s not up to them. It’s up to sales rep to set your times. Your routing just sucks. You’ll have a stop on one block then make you go to next stop across town then make you go back to a block you were just on to deliver another stop. Had supervisor and sales rep call me nonstop asking where I was and I’m not allowed to skip stops. Then call next week and say I need you to skip stops. Oh, and this always happens. Say they want it all then you take in all products and when finished they’ll say, “we don’t want half of it. Whoever placed ordered messed it up.” Then will have that stop again tomorrow. They want a 95% scan rate when labels aren’t on boxes or ripped and will call you to see why your scan rate is low. Then ask to take pictures of ALL damaged scan labels and send them to supervisor. Make you drive to a stop four times a week and it’ll be for 5 items. Sometimes the stop will be 45 minutes away too. I won't get off till 7pm when I’ve been working since"
bad,I would not recommend this job for anyone.  Terrible work life balance.  No room for advancement.  Negative culture.  Favoritism and Nepotism rampant.  Compensation is a joke.
bad,"I worked in the warehouse as a reach truck operator. When I was interviewed and hired. What they told me in the interview was different then when I started. They don't train you at all, they are crazy about the numbers you are supposed to put up every shift "
bad,One of the worst managed places I have worked at. The two main warehouse managers have zero respect for the hard working employees. Human resources is just as useless.
bad,"Everyone trying to run you over, screaming at you to get out of the way.  No teamwork, just a bunch of crazy people driving fast on order jacks.   I felt unsafe and unappreciated by management.  Got  Layed Off when season was over April.   Complete BS."
bad,worst company ever     treats drivers like garbage     pretends to be nice first but then keeps ripping u off on pay days  ....   they are always charging u 100$ for temprature gauge even when they are returned when they only sell them for 30$  most of us drivers here are looking for something else     stay away from this place
bad,Bad management and decreasing pay for the salesforce makes this job very difficult for anyone.  Do not expect to make a decent salary with this company unless management gives you accounts.
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone stay away poor management long hours and work on weekends trucks running late, 15 to 21 stop a day trucks are overloaded"
bad,It was a good bunch of workers.Had a lot of laughts.Sysco lost the tim horton account so we lost our joobs.One day your there next gone. Went from buffalo  to syracuse twice a night.
bad,"management in the fleet shop is chaotic and below satisfactory for drivers, constantly waiting on parts for trucks, manager constantly yelling at emloyees and outside vendors, hr department backs everything the boss in the shop does that would potentially get anyone else fired"
bad,"Not the Old Sysco. Used to be a great Family oriented business, But now has turned into a Clique driven , Who is related to Whom, workplace. They have weeded out almost all the employees with longevity by basically forcing them out , or setting there targets so high it is impossible to hit, so they can get you out of paying you a higher salary. In other words they will move the goal post constantly to make you fail. Nepotism is Rampant. Cliques are Rampant. Management is only out to pad their own pockets by cutting corners so their yearly bonuses are higher. Rules are not consistent at all. They change rules , according to who it is. People in the same department are not treated the same as far as the rules go. If they play golf together they can do no wrong, But if you don't socialize with these people on your own time , they treat you different and will weed you out. two people in the same department can make the same mistake and they will only write up the one that is not their buddy. In other words , fraternization is rampant. Your personnel information is not protected at all. There is a free flow of Confidential information around there. Termination reasons are freely discussed as well as disciplinary action or write ups are left on printers. There is no sense of Confidentiality in the HR department."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,i highly recommend that everyone stay away from sysco they will work you likes dogs and be noting only rude and ignorant to you and they take money out of your pay for lunch brakes and your not even allowed to tale your brakes but you still loose the money on your check.
bad,"Sysco is behind the times when it comes to work life balance, listening to employees, and benefits.  If you want to work 7 days a week and most holidays this is the place for you.  Not to mention zero women in top management roles."
bad,Very insecure management and the salaries are very low.  Would not recommend this company for anyone with a lot of experience in the current career.  Maybe some other time.
bad,The management stinks they set there drivers up for failure. They don't care about your family when there is a family emengrcey and you call out than they try to fire you
bad,Trying to keep up with their delivery standards are impossible.just about every delivery driver works thru unpaid lunch break just because your always behind.this job sucks very bad this is just a little of how horrible this job is their is not enough writing space needed this company does not care about you at all just your delivery numbers.
bad,very stressful and not a customer service company. management does not care for employees. only focused about making profit. changes are occurring and do not know what is sticking or going
bad,"Huge sales turnover and you'll be replaced in 6 months with new sales class. Starting pay is 50k but expect to work 7 days a week and tied to a laptop and company phone 24/7 and holidays. You'll use your own car for deliveries due to in-house mistakes. Expect abuse but reporting to HR is futile. Skip them and go straight to HR corporate. They will expect unreasonable sales quotas after 6 months when new leads are given to favorites.  Groceries are much cheaper at restaurant depot and the reps that make money rip off their customers charging 50% more."
bad,"When hired, I was told that I would be working eight hour shifts. After the first week, I was working 13-14 hours a day. Management didn't have experience needed to run the department."
bad,"A typical night at Sysco you come in around 5pm start off in the freezer and when the freezer side is almost complete they throw you on the dry side when you are a newbie the veterans don't get thrown around they finish their side and they gone while the newbies finish up everything until the 4am-5am sometimes 6am and they talk about job advancement well that's if you been with the company over an extended period of time, not to mention the veterans have a much more different pay scale then the new comers let's just say you'll be do much more work then the vets and make much more less while working much more."
bad,management stunk and the routing was terrible.  they cant keep people due to the work load and the lack of understanding.  would never recommend Sysco to anyone
bad,No life at all . if you leave they won't let you come back at all even when they say any experience working at another sysco is a plus .
bad,"very unprofessional.  Scared to go to work every day afraid of the constant negativity from management, peers and customers.  Only positive was I did learn a bit about the industry from my time in the field."
bad,Was a temp for 2 months.  Was trained for 1 day. Busted my butt for the time I was there.  Worked 10 hour days.  The first two weeks were great.  Co-Workers super friendly then week three hit and the cattyness began.  Micro managed by fellow employee who was not a supervisor.  They stood over me while waiting for me to finish my tasks.  Would go through my desk and just take stuff without letting me know or leaving a note so I wasted time looking for work that I thought I had misplaced.  Was ultimately let go do to not completing a function of my job that I was never trained on.
bad,"Terrible place to work,15 yrs and got absolutely no respect.Nothing but a pack mule.Brown nose management did not stand behind drivers,did not properly maintain equipment,constantly cutting pay,hours,benefits while expecting more and more from drivers everyday.This place will destroy your body because of the amount of unnecessary work you have to do because of the totally fouled up way they do things.Do yourself a favor and RUN as fast as you can away from this company!"
bad,Supervisors were slack at there jobs didn't give care about u hire ex employee to train new one when he couldn't do the job saying it's easy when he would work on his breaks to get his numbers
bad,This company over work their employees.  The accounting tasks lacks the use of accounting knowledge.  You will not enjoy working for this company if you are seeking to advance in your accounting career.
bad,Sysco is not a family friendly place to work for. I had my schedule changed four times in two months. That doesn't work well with kids or family. One day you would work 7-8 hours and the next day you'd work a 12 hour shift.
bad,"no Matter how well you think you are doing its never good enough. Your ""boss"" does not have a clue as to what a logistic coordinator is supposed to do"
bad,"No sales"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Its an okay company to work for if you are residing in Houston, TXif you want to work in the Foodservice industry. Benefits, flex time"
bad,The worst place I've ever worked for...they tell you what you want to hear in the beginning to get you in. .then slowly start to show you the true meaning of the word SYSCO....Sell Your Soul CO..inc..they will work you like a horse. .yeah and they have their favorites running around ..they are the company eye's and ears. . Watch out! Don't let them fool you...they ruined a lot of lives with their lies. .
bad,"they force driver work if you not in union and if you do your work "
bad,"Job Security/Advancement- Your Job Security with stay on thin ice because the routes they have. Don't even think about Advancement it will be 10 years before you can even think about that. They want to keep you on the truck as long as they can."
bad,Management was not good they let co-workers bully.  This was the worst place by far that I have ever worked. No breaks long days 10 to 12 hours.
bad,"They care nothing about your personal safety. 2am-5am start time typically 14 hour days of hard work unloading all day with faulty equipment. Management is terrible no help whatsoever. They continually try to intimidate you to make you quit. They play games with your check (missing hours/didn't take correct taxes) Everything is scattered all over the truck and hard to find, buried or unloaded stock. Management is always on your back calling you to find out your location, truck has gps and cameras. You are running on all cylinders all day and the company burns you out and fires you whenever they feel like it. Avoid Avoid Worst company to work for"
bad,Horrible company and management is the worst.....don't apply here also rip you off on your pay. Again DONT APPLY HERE!!!!
bad,"No car package or gas card. You ride around on your expense which is ridiculous. Upper management makes up reports which occupy your time that have nothing to do which increasing sales or cold calling. Turnover is 65%. Meet some cool people out of 8 people that started 1 is left. "
bad,"You think you applying for secret service to work here, awful reviews recruiter not even in state where applying cant even pronounce city correctly, I wasted my time even applying to deliver food, No wonder they looking for help, high turnover"
bad,Employee should not work at sysco.. Because atmosphere of work place is very disgusting due to senior persons.. Management is quit good bur seniors are of very ruddy nature........
bad,Leadership is terrible and they with literally set you up to fail if it means saving their own behinds.  HR is beyond terrible
bad,This is the worst job i ever worked at ...do not i repeat do not go into to that spooky hunted castle... i hated there..  you have no life at all
bad,The management is not supportive and very discriminatory about minorities moving up in the company. Managers only care about how good they look not what a vital asset their employees are or how they are the ones that make them look that way. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the fact it is a service industry and nothing you do is ever good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job was the personal support you get from coworkers. This atmosphere is not good for someone who is looking for long term employment.
bad,a typical day at work was when our supervisor almost died he got crushed between tow trailers he forgot to pull the spring brakes on one of the truck when he was moving pallets from a trailer to another then he ended up in the hospital with broken desk and both legs after one of the workers was at the site that time he heard him screaming with loud voice then he knew he was hurt.
bad,I learned this company operates like a high school. If you are not friends with the right people then you don't exist. Upper management needs to be replaced.
bad,"Usually an 8 hour day  with more down time then I asked for which was the most difficult part of my job.    I was involved in mergers/and acquisitions which didn't always stay within their time frame.  "
bad,"HR department is very unorganized.  They only side with Executives and ingnore plees from employee.  Payroll was set up wrong with several employees that I know of, including me."
bad,"Repaired Machinerys"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Overloaded with work. Pay does not match responsibilities."
bad,"DRIVERS BEWARE!!!  You are setup to fail before your day begins.  Managers ""gloat"" at Sysco high turnover for drivers. This is the worst company that I have ever worked for.  You stay in violation of DOT rules and regulations.  Managers (very dishonest & incompetent) manipulate logs so you can work 17 plus hours a day.  I have worked many (85 hour work weeks) and of course you know I did not get a full 10 hour break.  You will receive your load 2-4 hours late and managers expect for you to complete your route.  Warehouse loads trailer absolutely WRONG.  This is a strong “front of the house"" and ""back of the house"" mentality ran organization meaning managers use ""political blame game"" to cause friction  between drivers and warehouse personnel.  Word of advice, if you are a professional CDL driver, please do not work for this company.  Once you calculate (financially) the long hours and the back breaking work that you are doing, you will realize that you may be making $13-$14 hour.  And to add insult to the long hour and limited to pay, your pay check, 9 out 10 times will be wrong.  Yes, payroll will fix it but it becomes a nuisance will fast.  Drivers do not waste your time."
bad,"this company went out of businessa typical day at work"
bad,Worst interviewer ever! She wasn't prepared and looked so haggard and couldn't even read right from the cheat sheet questions in hand. Did not listen or care about of all the things that I said. Stared by the glass wall window the entire interview. Very unprofessional. Good thing I did not get the job because I would not care to waste my time working for someone like that. What a reflection to the whole company itself.  I will not dare to apply for this company again.
bad,"No training at all. Management is never in the office to assist in making decisions yet you are held 100% accountable for your work with little to no instruction or expectations. Allow ""senior"" employees to treat co-workers poorly without reprimand. If you aren't in the ""it crowd"" your not accepted or praised for your work even though it's better than the favorites. By far the worst experience ever with any employer."
bad,I was checking these labels and that was my worst experience ever I stayed with them for year and half they are horrible.
bad,Being a team leader helping my coworker when need. assisted my supervisor when my help is need for special project and chair side help.
bad,"Typical day: 65,000-90,000 Count items to be picked on short staff"
bad,"By far the worst company you can ever work for. The mangement is horrible and treat you like a whipping boy. If you dont mind working 70 hours a week and getting paid for 40 then this job is for you. If you also like to work in a enviroment that you always have to watch you back and cover your own butt then apply. If you want to work for a compant that has no clue what teamwork is between management then apply. Also if you like being sold paradise during a interview, then once your hired you realize everything they told you was complete BS then apply."
bad,"Well let's face the facts about the Meat cutting side of Sysco NC...."
bad,it seems even though you did a great job no one let you know I worked hard at every job I had but the supervisors for maint. needed more schooling on management.
bad,"Started out great at Sysco - but mid level leaders starting modeling the really personal and political agendas of top level leaders.  The agenda of your leader was oriented towards the individual.  There were several instances where my boss took direct credit and won awards for work that I designed and performed, with no acknowledgement for my part."
bad,really hated the place you have 20 bosses so when you mess up 20 tell you .people in the top are stuck up
bad,"If it sounds to good to be true it is. 4 day work week is 14 hours a day on performance based pay. Trucks governed at 60 mph, means more road time leading to fatigue. Most routes are over nights and weekends for new drivers, leaving you tired and sore. Dash cameras watch you and are used against you for petty things. Daily slip-seating on poorly maintained vehicles. Seniority means nothing, its all favoritism as a new driver your expendable and set up for failure. They preach safety, but when you get hurt, not if, they blame you and write you up. Get your experience driving here but dont expect a bright future. Driver morale is at an all time low!"
bad,A Typical work day includes several meetings.
bad,"At first they seems like a company who looks after their employees well. But this is just a face, you will be surprise the treatment you recieve when you are there. You are discriminated against that my personal opinion. THEY WILL TREAT YOU LIKE DOGS......"
bad,"Not a good experience.  My advice is to keep looking for a better opportunity. If you are fresh out of college and looking for a sales position this may be a good fit, but if you have any sales experience what so ever, you can do better!"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,All smiles when they hire you....totally different story upon working towards passing probation.  Immediate supervisors treat you like dirt.  Literally no training but they want you to deliver product as if you’ve been there for years or as if you’ve had a regular route.  Hated going to work every day.  Place is so disorganized.  No wonder they’re mass hiring right now.
bad,The management expected you to be above everyone else and pushed you beyond your limits.  Hard job if you have a family due to the work hours.  Example: the day my father passed away they would not give me time off for several weeks ..... two months to be exact.  Horrible management!!
bad,They call late the night before youre scheduled to work between 4-6am. Don't have any care for safety although they say they do.  Not organized at all.  They go through management like an alcohol goes through liquor.  Every month the people you report to are no longer working there and the new employee has no idea about previous arrangements or how runs usually go.  Dispatch is horrible as well.  No cb's aloud in trucks or Bluetooths.  No sleeper cabs for long distances.  All in all a complete waste of time if you're looking for long term employment.  You'll be lucky if they keep you for over two years.  Don't trust a person at this company.  Not even co-workers.
bad,"At Sysco Gulf Coast it is a toxic work environment where you are bullyed by managment to make sales goals. If you speak up you are put down and are toldt that you are not a team player and to stop being negative. This artical is exactly how my time at Sysco was. It is a keep your mouth shut and head down work place, unless you want to be targeted and bullyed by managment and senior sales reps."
bad,Horrible company union sucks took 6 months to get my health insurance And uniforms and union strikes and can’t even get anything out of the negotiations. Management will threaten your job if you strike but to get health care you have to join the union
bad,"You are required to work long hours, doing very hard labour which is fine because you are compensated for it. However, you're forced to wear a computer on your atm that measures your efficiency and if you're not maintaining 95% efficiency on a nightly basis, you're fired. Fear tactics are used to make you work longer hours when mandatory isnt called. The union is a joke, their purpose is to protect the employees but this is taken advantage of by lazy old timers so the company is constantly at odds. Lots of employees who pretend to be your friend then rat on you to get you fired. The moral is so low that as a new employee on probation people are constantly telling you ""dont get injured, keep your head down, dont get sick, come when called in etc"" or you'll get fired. You're forced to sign a contract stating they can fire you any time within 1040 hours of work without a reason which is a time span that can sometimes last 4 or 5 months. I personally was fired a day before becoming unionized at this mark without a reason - likely having to provide job security, a raise and benefits. "
bad,Very fast paced work 12 to 14 hour days.  No room to go anywhere in the Company horrible working hours no family life pay was not really good for how hard we worked.
bad,"From management to workers who have been there for forever the people suck."
bad,I don’t recomendé this company to no one is the more crazy Company in New York ... this is no work this is kill you body is no way to have a good day working for this company ...
bad,"Work is Never done. As with many sales jobs, compensation doesn't match workload. District managers under pressure to constantly surpass last years numbers with rolls downhill."
bad,"In general, not a good company to work for.  Constant changes to daily workflows and workload.  Senior management says the only thing constant is change.  It's a euphemism for ineffective, weak, and almost whimsical decisions made by a poor leadership team that has created no end of stress and chaos for the staff that they lead.  In order to get promoted, you have to apply for the one or two slots available with a department of 100 people as the company doesn't want to pay higher salaries."
bad,"Awful management who care nothing about people. The job turns and burns people quickly, very high turnover rate. Out of a class of 8 people only 2 made it more than 4 months. Mandatory overtime and only 1 day off a week."
bad,"Working for Sysco was a disaster the company is ran by men and they hire mostly men, women are the minority.  It is cut throat and when you think you are making sales and doing well in your territory they fire you."
bad,This review is for the shared services center in Cypress.  There is not any opportunity to advance your career at this location.  Management have a weakness in managing work life balance.  Stay away if you want a career.
bad,Unfair work conditions. Warehouse horrible with packing. Minimal training will put you on the road and blame you for all mistakes not covered in training.
bad,Good talent is under paid and not appreciated. The hardest part about the job is working around team leads who do not know the true meaning of being an effective leader.  Team leads who gossip and talk serious business openly on the floor. Team leads who are more worried about other people's business outside of Sysco; than helping develop their team members to be successful. They place the wrong individuals in leadership roles.
bad,"working there is like being in an elementary school classroom , you always have bunch of memos about unnecessary stuff , the driver is always wrong all the time no matter what until proven innocent . you're always push around , yelled at by top management"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Leaders are not experienced and are not good leaders.  The workload is heavy with little to no support.  the environment is very demanding and requires long hours and no work/life balance.  The environment is chaotic.  "
bad,"More about reaching numbers than caring for employees. Corporate has more control and leaves the operating company with little control to compete. "
bad,Micro Management was an issue with this company.  The pay was not sufficient for the work they wanted done.  There was no designated leadership for shift that was assigned.  Employees were unprofessional and tended to not support each other.
bad,Has 3 months to make  their rate. If not they fire you it's like working in a slave warehouse being a driver is better pay and a better job they have a huge turn around rate most people last only about 3 months which is your training period after that if not at their percentage rate they'll fire you.
bad,"Gestionnaire laissé à lui même, sans support et aucune collaboration de la haute direction pour solutionner les problèmes. Beaucoup de politique interne. Bref, l'analogie est applicable à cette organisation. On demande de gagner un grand prix de formule un avec un Go cart. Pas d'outils, pas d'équipe et impossible d'en construire une, seul les chiffres comptent. Voilà!"
bad,"Bad Company to work for. "
bad,Run and run fast if you think Sysco Seattle is for you. Your boss went know what your job entails but will critic you which means your bonus or raise. Management and HR are clueless how to run the company successfully. RUN
bad,"stress, stress, stress, not enjoyable, was given a territory and then had my territory stripped away from me by another area, management was not very dependable, made promises that were never kept"
bad,sysco is a company that the more you brown nose the better off you are. they tell you always work safe but 80pct of the time the loads are unsafe to even start to unload. the sups are big time liers and if you dont run and work like a dog your gone asap.and dont count on the union to help
bad,"Does not have a culture"
bad,"This place is like a puppy mill.  Capitalism at its best.  Poor management and lock of trucking experience is very visible at every corner of the business model.  If you are a Pro-Trucker who takes pride in being safe and DOT compliant this is not for you. However,  if you are a new driver and have limited experience than it might work.  It might work not because it is a good job but you don't know enough to know.  This was my shortest employment.  They will make you sign bunch of papers about safety and make you take  safety programs to cover their rear.  They will do anything and everything to  make you work faster.  They won't do anything about the unsafe delivery locations and still be evasive to cover their rear if something happens to you.  I also see some positive reviews here about the company.  They must be from fake accounts.  Very high turn around within CDL-A drivers."
bad,"they lie to you about your hours. you work 10- 12 hours daily . understaffed. fire you after 3 months if you cant pick 200 cases a hour. expect you to run literally run and complete orders where your picking up 40-80 pound cases. unless your homeless or a immigrant with no school or doesn't speak English , I wouldn't recommend working here unless you just had no choice. you will only see your family once a week. manager has horrible people skills and they force you to stay past your shift. you get no sick time or benefits during those first three months and only allowed  four days where you can call in. I wouldn't work here for 30 a hour let alone the 16 they pay you."
bad,i interviewed with the manager and trainer of Flint Michigan region. I have numerous experience in this type of work. This was the worst interview i have ever had. these guys have no respect for anyone and simply want to cut you down and teach you how to do things there way. I cannot believe the company would allow such egotistical people to represent there company. they will never find anyone of value to work for them by treating people this way. DO NOT WORK FOR THEM. it will not end well for you.
bad,You have to call a hot line between 8:30pm and 9pm to get your start time. You could start anywhere from 12:00am-5am. No consistent routes. Management don't have a clue. The way the trucks are loaded is a joke. If you like to dig for every box for hours this is the place for you. I never worked at such an unorganized place.
bad,"The first group of management underpaid the the employee's they hired. then left. the new group in management didn't update the pay so you had people with less experience and tenure making more money. The computer and systems errors they are plagued with daily makes trying to do your job extremely hard, SAP, Email , Delivery Tracker and the Ordering System went down everyday the whole 2years i was there. They don't care for a work/life balance because they put you on a random rotating schedule. You are the only group in the building working all holidays and weekends the day of this review, i was let go because of a computer error that has happened twice before. on top of that it was by yet another new person from another call center who was only employed for 2 months. The individual opco's do what ever they feel and the sales people don't answer their phones. One sysco, sure it is. If you can start in any other department, do so but stay away from Customer support. It's a joke as a department and the people running it have no clue."
bad,No respect for the individual.  Completely unethical and dysfunctional management.  More work than can ever be done and your reward for your efforts will be a pink slip as they automate and shift jobs to Houston.
bad,"IT dept. is a sweat shop and management is unethical, has no vision and blames the employees for everything wrong with the culture or with their own department. If you have integrity, you will not go anywhere career wise."
bad,"Horrible place to work, not worth the money. They chew you up and spit you out.over 16 years all they have done is take everything away from there drivers. Pension,Christmas party,Christmas bonus,safety bonus, truck rodeo.save your pizza party for the 3rd graders.they say there drivers are the backbone of Sysco. More like the slaves of corporate greed and incompetence."
bad,"DON'T  believe what they tell you in the interview. I promise you they are full of it! They claim they provide training and give you time to get up to speed because safety was more important. At least that's what they said anyway! I was hired on Monday Jan 27 and let go by the following Wednesday because I didnt meet the 10 pallets moved per hour because I was only provided with a trainer/mentor less than a total of 4 hrs the ENTIRE 3 DAYS I WAS ON THE REACH LIFT! Mind you, I didnt start moving product until fri and that was only 4 hrs with absolutely no trainer at all. Worked monday 4 HRS AGAIN WITHOUT A TRAINER! FINALLY TUE I got a trainer for a little bit because he got ""called away"" Honestly, it was more like maybe 2 hrs! Even at that I'm being generous because the ""trainer"" kept leaving me alone without fully explaining things. Wednesday worked 6 hrs again with NO TRAINER because he was ""busy"" and let go Wednesday after they had me go home for the day. I told them NO WONDER THEY CANT KEEP PEOPLE! WHEN YOUR ""TRAINING"" IS A COMPLETE JOKE!! "
bad,Use to be a good company going down hill fast pay has dropped dramatically I recommend not working at Sysco very mismanaged hard work doesn’t pay off and you have to deal the union
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Good pay horrible management. Very shady company. Should be ready to work 6 days a week 10 to 12 hours a day. Working weekends & a lack of communication from upper management to lower management.
bad,"The culture at Sysco needs some work. Unfortunately, focus is on the bottom line rather than the business culture. Morale and productivity challenges are evident because of this across the organization. Happy employees equal productive employees."
bad,Mamagment needs to learn how to be trusted. This company will let you down and cross you out. Loyalty goes a long way with employees. I really think once Sysco knows that they will be better.
bad,I would never recommend this job to any one the management sucks they do not care about they employees they act like slave masters I would never ever ever ever ever work her again when I leave
bad,"The only good thing that came from Sysco was the pay. I didn’t get much home time and never knew if I was going to make it home. The trailers were always loaded poorly and were unsafe most of the time. Management never listened to safety concerns or better ways to make work easier and safer for drivers to work in. Good pay but overall, not a great place to work."
bad,"new ""KPI""'s every 2 seconds.  Management doesn't even consider how to achieve them because they are too busy in meetings about meetings that will lead to meetings. Weak, fake management.  Sysco is lipstick on a pig."
bad,"I worked as a order selector at Sysco Denver for a year.  I loved the work.. fast paced, challenging.  The problem there is the culture management has made.  Employees are not respected. Employees are expected to do as they are told and not question management.  There is no transparency, honesty or integrity from the company.  Instead of removing obstacles for the employees, they add them."
bad,Work yourself to death. Every driver is run into the ground. Management treats you like you do not matter. Job is terrible and is very unorganized. The trailers are loaded like complete chaos. Everything is basically thrown in the trailer and mixed. Only thing that was ok was the pay. That’s only because of the forced overtime and long drawn out hours.
bad,"If you are black and in management, you will eventually get fired. They let everyone who are not black transfer out or retire. The people of color are terminated!"
bad,I would not recommend this place as it is stressful and can cause health issues. Management is rude and uncompromising. It is not recommended that you speak your mind for fear of termination.
bad,"No respect for your skills and development"
bad,All these guys care about is getting their product delivered. They don't care about the driver and their personal life. If you get hurt outside work they don't pay you. Will force you to used your personal and sick days.
bad,"I was employed with Sysco 92 days I was told I was there 90 and let go . With Lin my first 2 months  I was evaluated and at the same time questioned about my loyalty to the company or the Teamsters! I replied with I see both sides and that my father told me to keep my nose clean and stay out of it not to vote."
bad,Too many common sense ideas are over looked. Any customer contacts you have are no longer yours. Some Managers are not too connected to reality. They are more worried about making reports and more reports than servicing customers.
bad,"In all honesty this branch of Sysco has been heading downhill for years, and isn't getting better anytime soon. They're bonus program can only be a achieved by working unsafe and putting your body and others at risk of injury. Coming in the door at this branch you'll be lucky to get 30 hours a week because they over staff to prevent anyone from getting full time. They've lost so much business they're one big customer away from closing the branch it seems like. Orders are maxed to the roof of trucks most nights to save money so they don't have to hire drivers, times are absolutely ridiculous to complete the orders. Working nights is already bad enough, but it's made even worse there. Supporting roles and supervisors do what they can but are so over worked I'm amazed they haven't quit themselves. When someone from management finally makes an appearance on nights for the most part you can see in their faces how little they care or want to be there. Honestly there's better jobs out there, pass on this place."
bad,"Managements suck they don’t listen to you they yell n screaming at you one time manager curse at me "
bad,Expectaions are unachievable. Break DOT laws daily. Management doesnt listen. Skip this place is you can. Not all money is good money. Good pay lead to a bad life work balance
bad,"Poor management and no work/life balance.  Female leads would be in the office doing other female employees hair when they are suppose to be working. The night supervisor in charge would fall asleep in his office. Training is two days and then they throw you in the freezer and it's sink or swim! U never work the schedule you were hired for,  mandatory overtime every week. Most of the forklifts break down nightly. If the day shift bosses in the office knew what was happening at night then there probably be some changes,  maybe!!! Go some where else,  their are other jobs in the area paying the same rate with less nonsense."
bad,You are not a person. You are a position and a salary. They let people go with no notice only to replace you. Probably at a lower salary. Disregard for employees. Management looks out for management. HR is useless. Low moral. No appreciation.
bad,This by far the worst Sysco location in history. They hire so much drivers but don’t have the work. You barely get enough hours to support your family. Literally they will call you and tell you don’t come into work because there is no work. So why Would you hire drivers then ? Dumbest excuse I’ve heard I’m looking for another job as we speak I highly recommend working somewhere else if your looking to get that annual salary that they promise. Good luck !
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Spent 12 years with company and it all came to an end because new manager saw me as a threat. Went and told management that I said that she didn’t know how to do her job. I never said that but now I know that she didn’t.
bad,"Sysco only cares about production, they have extreme production standards which allows them to short hand the facility to make employees work more than any of them need to. They jam their trucks with product which create unsafe working conditions, when a customer complains,management doesn’t back you up. Anything that goes wrong is your fault, union wont back you up. Long hours and they don’t care about personal issues. You better have a sick day saved for a doctors appointment or you won’t be making it to the appointment. Equipment is not well maintained due to restrictions on maintenance department to meet quarterly spending so the boss gets a bonus. Mechanics are forced to only work 40 hours, only department that does not have overtime."
bad,"I was at sysco for 18yrs and the more yrs an individual works ther,the more the management tries harder to find reasons to get rid of an individual.there is no open door policy with company."
bad,No balance between life and worlk. Working 60-70 hours a week.  Very phisical work. They don’t care about you at all. You’re just another number and if you don’t make they’ll bring some one else.
bad,"Worst job ever lots of over time due to poor routing. management "
bad,"Hard work good pay. Terrible management and hours fluctuate weekly. There is a very high turnover rate and for good reason MANAGEMENT!!! No paid break, no Holliday’s off, no leeway when it comes to keeping up with their standards."
bad,Very disappointed with this Company. I had only 40 hrs left from my probation period and they dismissed me. They have just used me for 5 months and as soon as the business started getting slow they started getting rid of new people who are not unionized. Be careful guys before you start working with them this place is full of politics and back stabbing. Very hard work and you get all garbage deliveries for couple of years. It is based on seniority and they have many old people who been working from last 10 years or so. All downtown calls are downstairs or upstairs which drained out all the energy. I would recommend that get incorporated and work for your own business. I only like about this job is my co- workers.
bad,"Worst place to possibly work, management people in place that don't belong where there at. Get injured on the Job might as well find a new job while your off work (light duty) they will find a reason to get rid of you. Love to issue write ups for nothing worthy of being written up for.. Your Just a NUMBER with this company they could give two sh its about you, or your family!! DON'T waste your time killing yourself for this company. There are TONS of jobs that are better paying or close too it with alot less physical and mental work!!"
bad,"this is a publicly traded company that Stock price comes first.  The company uses sales as a side income.  The op-co makes there money blackballing brokers and manufacturers charging anywhere from 4 to 6 k for a slot in a warehouse.  The money that is given is supposed to help sales as well as give spiffs awards etc we never see a dime.  An item that is priced out at 45.00 at the back dorr could inflate as high as 80.00 cost. The salesforce  has not even touched the item and it is overpriced.  "
bad,"The only thing great about that job is the pay other than that , it is literally modern day slavery."
bad,"The first year at Sysco was my best. Goals were attainable, bonus levels were reached. I didn’t mind not being paid much for my car or phone. After that first year and the following 3 years at Sysco each year was a new pay structure. They would make goals especially difficult to hit and bonuses were out of reach. They would say the new pay structure was to benefit the sales people but my check got smaller and smaller every year even though my sales increased substantially."
bad,"This place sucks the big one. They treat you like a machine because that’s what they want. They may pay well but good luck having a healthy body after working there. I’m telling all of you, if you can work elsewhere than do so, it’s not worth the pay."
bad,A culture that runs inefficiently.  We have been asked to perform activities that are less than ethical.  The environment has become cold.  Advancement is non-existent.  Pay is less than competitive.
bad,"During the interview and training process, they will make it sound like a dream job but truth be told, if it sounds to good to be true, it typically is. They have a high sign on bonus for a reason. They can't get a lot of people to stay and for a good reason. It's a great paying job and only because they will work you to the max. You WILL have to run some overnight routes and stay away from home from time to time. When staying at a hotel overnight, you are responsible for forking out the cost up front in which you will get reimbursed somewhere between 2 days to 2 weeks.  On a given day, you will deliver anywhere between 600-1000k plus cases daily on a hand truck and ramp. They stress go go go but when you go go go, you will have an accident or hurt yourself in some fashion. They preach safety but the way alot of trailers are loaded, you can only be so safe. Most of the tractors and trailers are in horrible shape and nothing to feel safe in. You will spend more time digging for cases than what you will delivering the product. If you are not in shape, this job definitely isn't for you. If you are looking to make some good money but not a long term career, this is a great job for you."
bad,"Overall Experience at Sysco was a nightmare. You have to train for 7 weeks, 3 of the 7 will be in state or out of state. It's a classroom setting where the learning and development managers they are called have you role play in multiple sales simulations, and you have to take a mid term exam and final exam. When you are in the field training, sales team is very defensive of their customers and it's hard to get a firm understanding on anything. It's like they don't want you to know, and you have 4 to 5 hours a day if that with the sales team. Much better companies and teams that will make you feel welcomed. On top of all that you have poor management.Take my advice and steer clear from Sysco. "
bad,Poor management from corporate down to middle masnagement. Blames you if you get huirt. No team players. If you do good expect to do your route and half of somebody elses.
bad,"They start u off easy than keep lying about deliverers, pay, time ,10 years gone. they went from no sign on bonus to 5000 to 10000 dollars. Every  accident is always the drivers fault. I quit because they tried to move me off line haul to street stops because they had no one to make deliver's."
bad,"A typical work day here is stressful,hard and painful this is a two man job without a doubt the warehouse don't give two cares how they organize your pallets/stops you'll be digging majority of your shift touching and moving things three times or more they not straight up with you when you start you learn everything as you go stops,routes etc. They give you a route and don't tell you nothing about the stops they leave you out there and you have to pay tolls you have to pay for your own rooms and fuel for their trucks if your coming in and fuel is to low for you to make it back they reimburse you two days to a week later,the communication is awful if you run into a problem on your route don't expect for the supervisors to answer their phones your gonna be stuck out there unless one decide to answer or call back the money is good but not worth the extremely hard work you have to do, the trucks are trash they break down a lot the trucks are in the shop more then on the road and they'll fire you very quick without giving you a chance to keep your job I see why the turn over rate is so high and why they have such a high sign on bonus."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Unless you're absolutely positively hardup for cash, avoid this place like the plague. Especially the Fremont yard. The amount of stress is not worth the pay."
bad,Every tractor I have been in had a engine light on. One of them had a really bad steering wheel that was rocking while turning. Seat belts pop open while driving. Damage on side of trailers on most trailers. Air bags are in rough shape on most trailers. Wheels and rims are all have rast. Abs lights always come on trailers. They don't bother fixing any of them.
bad,you are a truck number no home time you have to work sick or you lose your job hurting or your fired no one is understanding about family time children time
bad,If you are a heads down worker then this company is definitely a place for you to thrive. Multi-tasking with tenacious team players is the name of the game for the driven workplace culture.
bad,Red tape and politics! Awful trucks without Air conditioning. Terrible Hand trucks. They like to hire external rather than letting internal advance. Turn over is higher than the fast food restaurant. You can make more money driving local with another company in a truck with AC and just bumping docks.
bad,You have no life other than Sysco. They work 6 days a week when you new up until who knows when. The pay is okay. I've had better pay and a lot less headache and body aches. The job itself shouldn't be nearly as hard as it is over at Sysco. The way the trailer is loaded doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Sign on bonus or not I personally know that I'll never work for the again.
bad,In short if you want to be healthy and happy then dont even apply here.Its the worst company i ever worked for and i quited in the end.They are bunch of liars that treat people like slaves and numbers without rights.Hernia and injuries are a common thing in that company and they dont even try to change something.If u want to be a supervisor there then u have to be brain damaged and without any sympathy.
bad,Management sucks and everything about this jobs sucks. You've been warned.I've worked in warehouse for over 8 years and this is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for.
bad,Did not like the working environment.  It is a very hostile very unappreciative environment.  No matter what you do it is never good enough.  Everyday is a new threat on how you could loose your job.
bad,"Long hours every day, never appreciated for the work you complete. if you want to work 65 hours a week and 6 days a week this is the job for you, you will get burned out fast and will stay on night shift for years."
bad,They will sell you a dream.  Once you get hired you will see the ugly truth.  You are just a number and you can work hard and try to move up but if you not the favorite you wont go any where.  If you are looking for a check this is the place for you. Other than that keep it moving. This place has had 4 HR Directors in 8 years that should be a clear RED FLAG!!
bad,"dont work for sysco winnipeg, management will never listen to your problem and will always say do more do more, even if that means driving trailer with air leak, or full loaded to back of trailer and you have to unload and deliver that trailer by standing at 3 inch wide lip. and do not be  a broker there, that ll be your life's biggest mistake, including myself 5 brokers are gone."
bad,Stay away from this company. Management will work you to death and stab you in your back over any reason. This company was the worst experience of my life. They will terminate you if you sneeze wrong. Different driver's come in and go out by the boat load at least three times a week. STAY AWAY!!!!!
bad,"High employee turn over rate. Management is clueless. Lack of training. They do hire convicted felons. Need I say more? "
bad,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
bad,"only one day off on call the other nothing but lies from management , dispatch does not have a clue,your expendable they will do what ever they can to push you out of the door"
bad,"This place would talk the talk without walking the walk. They preached safety but rarely practiced it. Constant confrontations between management and union employees. Very high demands, almost daily mandatory overtime. The 5:30pm-4:00am shift makes it impossible to have a life outside of work."
bad,Was excited to begin my journey until I started. There is no work/life balance. If you have a family this isn't the place to be. They do not consider family at all. Worked every holiday and Sundays. No reverence for religious beliefs. Only concerns are deadlines and the OPCOs. Employees are NOT they're major concern.
bad,Loved workingat this place. Very friendly folks. Learned alot. Had to leave because my mom got sick. Wish I can work there again.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Sysco, pfg , us food , dicarlo food ,,,,, jb hunt,,,,is bad driver company,,,,away looking for driver because de quit,,,,the jobs is crazzy work an is not a place to retirement 4 o 5 week of work you will quit,,,,,, dont try......I work in does company is no good,,,,"
bad,Very poor upper management with no concern for their customers success. This division bases their success on their customers not checking weekly prices and their sales reps increasing prices weekly without customers knowledge. There is a reason why this division has so much turnover and is constantly hiring Sales Reps. This is not a career position so if you want to work long term for a company do not seek employment here!
bad,"work unsafe place ,hot, most enjoy leaned a lot mangement is goodable part week end off"
bad,"This company is managed by personalities whos' only interest is to get the product out of the door at all costs and shows little or no consideration towards it's shopfloor workers. I didn't really enjoy working for this company as it works on the premise of chaos and is reactive rather than proactive in it's approach to almost everything. My favourite part of the job was probably leaving at the end of shift, the hardest part was dealing with management incompetence and trying to supervise and motivate a continually disgruntled workforce. Health and safety within Sysco Nasys is conducted on an Ad Hoc basis and the loosely speaking safety manager (no safety qualifications) has little or no idea in developing a safety strategy and promoting a positive safety culture."
bad,"Would prefer to share this information during a one on one interview, however, I will say that I have been in sales for 20+ years and NEVER received ongoing sales training with any organization better than here. The techniques I acquired from my employment is worth more that words can explain."
bad,"Drivers start as early as 3 am, go out with too many stops and cases on thier trucks [ by DOT law you can work 14 hrs but they schedule you for over 16 hrs some days]. Managment is CONSTANTLY harrasing drivers. They put cameras with microphones inside the trucks so they can watch and listen to you all day, so you go out and bust your ***working to get the stops off then get back to work and find your name on a LONG list of drivers to see managment about some bull about violation of company policy. You have no home life exept go home take a shower and go to bed, then get up and go through the same thing day after day."
bad,"Management are pretentious egotistical nut jobs...The labor standards on nights is insane...not to mention that they hire just enough workers to make for 12 hours days and forced overtime (six day work weeks) for new hires. They have cameras in every aisle with any incident being reviewed by an incident review board..anything like scraping a rack, damaging a case, preforming and unsafe act of any kind..sure the money is great but I have also seen night selectors trying not to cry in the locker room..stay away from this place if you value family or sanity!!!"
bad,"Sysco denver transportation is awful. Overall sysco is a good company, this opco has exceptionally horrible management in transportation department. The director of transportation is dishonest, lazy and unprofessional."
bad,"sysco is a good company but uper Mangement is running it like a slave trade, they constantly over load trucks with cases no room to work unsafe work environment!! Supervisor are losers who ride around in there lil mini vans spying on drivers looking for somthing to complain about instead of trying to help a driver who is behind, that company has had many great drivers but they fire them"
bad,"You work six days per week full days and you pay all expenses for your car and phone   You drive an average of  25,000 plus miles a year with No reimbursement.   Great 401(k) great insurance terrible salary considering what you have to pay out of your pocket for your expenses  you work every Sunday usually 4-5 hours minimum"
bad,"Sysco was one of the worst places I’ve ever worked. The training is absolute garbage. The trainer talked more about himself than how to do the job.They train you how to run a power jack, which pallets to put your product on, but not how to stack your pallets which is the most important part of the job. The time quotas are nearly impossible for new employees to meet. I was fired at 4 months even though I asked numerous times for extra help because I was having a hard time and was told not to worry about my job and then got fired the same day. stay away the money isn’t worth it you have to work every stat holiday and work afternoons so if you have a family it’s very hard ."
bad,The pay is great but everything else is horrible. Managers are scum that will turn on you on a dime and falsify reasons to get rid of you. God forbid you get hurt on the job. They will fire you for being on workers comp even though it's your LEGAL right to do so. Managers are snakes and liars. Work is Brutal and they loose people weekly so it gets harder and harder. Nobody wants to stay since the place is run by morons who have zero professionalism. Retail is a better choice. Union is full of snakes too.
bad,"They only care about the numbers, they don’t care about anything else! You want have no family life working here! They will try there hardest to get you come back in before your 10 hours off, they will change your logs for you....which is 100% illegal!"
bad,"Pay is the only thing good here and even then a stretch. Company pretends to care about employees but obviously the bottom line is all that matters. Provides very minimal training or supervision, much of the equipment is broken or malfunctioning, and basically no time off especially for new employees but you’re expected to work to standards on a daily basis.The epitome of a company that expects you to give your life for them and even that’s not enough. Some suggestions if management reads this:"
bad,Staff members were great and very positive about changes. Transportation and operation manager did not want fleet department to succeed. Used 3rd party vendor that their own people were not even qualified to work on equipment but if you say anything about that you get fired. Management needs to learn the process of running fleet not just customer service.
bad,"none its a job just look at it like that, they dont care about you, they pay ok but not for all the work you have to do, not a place to make a career out of , alot of hard work and long days , your loads are not loaded right and they cant care its on you to work around it , just say good luck if you work for them get in and out"
bad,sysco has become a 1% commission company.  items need to be deviated to compete in market and only given 1% of gross profit.  no mileage or car expense.  salary is good until you get into a route and its base pay of $185 plus 1% commission.  cant make a living off 1%.  i spent close to $400.00mth for gas to hit all accounts for orders and turn around to collect check payments.
bad,Get your experience then leave. Your just a body until you get hurt. They have terrible equipment. No one appreciate you. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
bad,"They will let you go before your 90 days because they want to hire as many drivers as they can for the year. At the of the year it looks better for them and they will pay less tax."
bad,No home/work life balance. Very long hours Management sucks and they are very  unorganized.Upper Management plot against associates. They set them up to get fired. They are slow about answering questions.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Sysco L.A. no home life you will get plenty of o.t. if you dont mind working from sun up to sun down. You will run out of hours and either lay over are finish the route by some coming in a company non dot vehicle.  you drive the the vehicle while the other guy logs into the truck you and the personwill finishyour stops if he feelslike helping you. And whenever you clock out for the day no matter what time it is in 10 hours you are expected to be at work in 10 hours.It may take up to 2 years to get a route so you'll be on call until then.But its union so once you pay your union dues your benefits are free.With that said if you dont mind working every Saturday long days with great pay mixed pallets try it out..
bad,"Worse warehouse I’ve ever worked in . Unorganized , sloppy work seemed like people just settled with it for the pay ! Treats workers like dogs especially if you’re new . They may like they care about you but they want their work done even if you’re hurt , they want it DONE ! Applied for one position , started as something total opposite ! Just worse experience ever for me and will NEVER recommend someone to wrk there !!"
bad,"They have their own idea of what cream of the crop of drivers means. You are supported by drivers only. The company sets you up as salmon swimming up stream. Even if you don't give up and do not call in there is no guarantee you are the right fit. 80 percent or more do not make it. The union does not intercede until after your probation is up. This company wastes so much money. This company does not give a majority of it's drivers the tools like lift gates and electric pallet jacks that would allow most drivers to be effective and efficient. Why the company does not understand that it can only improve it's bottom line by doing such things is beyond most. You'd have to experience it to believe it. If the company wasn't so flush with money it would collapse on it's own sinking sand.  Why management is in derision and doesn't know or care that it's own worst enemies are in it's own ranks is at best absurd."
bad,"You work long hours, favoritisms to a selected few, no training, no guildlines to getting fully hired in with benefits. If laid off you won’t receive unemployment because Sysco is exempted from paying. No family time just all work. Will burn out throughout the week. 3 months max and you’ll definitely want to start looking to change jobs."
bad,"horrible management and they play favoritism to certain guys. long hours. people call out or leave early which leaves the pickers short handed with more work on their plate. also they don’t get punished because they are the teachers pet. must be nice. no energy. no motivation. same old stuff just a different day. no family time. be ready to work 16-17 hr days. i’ve seen it all here. don’t work at the kent location. no fun and very boring and you’ll get worn out. they don’t reward hard work unless you kiss up to them. the snow storm that just happened, yeah i got fired for calling in and guess what, i had enough sick time to cover but they let me go. ain’t that something? if management doesn’t change, this place will suffer."
bad,"I've been here for a year and a half and i hated it from day one. The fountain pop machine is filthy, ""ive heard from sources that it has never been cleaned. The orange/cranberry juice machine was coming out a brown color because it was never cleaned. That just shows you how much the office staff is appreciated. Upper management are bully's and don't acknowledge you as you walk passed. Prepare to ALWAYS look busy, if you dont the President will walk by and see your not busy and then go talk to your boss. they will then load you with more and more work, BUT they wont give you a raise even after you've been here for a year. The salespeople are golden children that get all the incentives. Hostile work place, no talking, no laughing, i guarantee you will hate it here."
bad,Sysco is the worst company I've ever worked for they are not about their employees whatsoever. They do not utilize their employees to their abilities. It is nothing that I expected when I got hired.
bad,Good money no life broken back. bad hours start at 6pm usually till 530 am 5 days a week. non stop percentage based job and they just lowered the percent so very fast more or less not safe according to their policies to keep up with what they want. pay is good it is union perfect for younger single persons. lifting and stooping non stop for usually 10+ hours usually 50 - 100 lbs again non stop. ground level to above head non stop for 10+ hours 5 days a week.  hours didn't work for me and my family. management worst I have seen in over 20 years of working
bad,the management at sysco are not trained in working for the human being...all they want is to look good on paper then get rid of you when you slow down or get hurt.
bad,"long hours"
bad,Poor managers ever felt needed dishonesty things changed daily trips were given out to there favorites lower level management r back stabers this is why there r not number one in the food service industry
bad,"If you are applying as an accountant with CPAS my advice?  RUN! My first week was Sysco speaks where retry much every employee complained about the work, the hours, the management, the directors , the treatment... you think I️ would’ve caught the hint but naturally I️ told myself every job is stressful I’m just here for a paycheck ... boy was I️ wrong ... Sysco could care less about its employees ... all they want is their work done . You will see new workers here ever week because turn over is so high. You will be stressed out if you work in gl accounting .. I️ almost went into labor 3x due to all the stress I️ was under when I️ work here & please know my manager could care less. I hated this place ... let’s just say I️ went on maternity leave & I️ never had intentions of coming back . Everyone there is secretly looking for another job"
bad,Job Work/Life Balance is non existent. A typical 12 hour day gained you nothing more than good compensation and benefits. Low morale and a very challenging workplace culture driven by a union mentality. No loyalty to dedicated associates.
bad,"Good pay and benefits. Days are long, but you can start early in the morning and finish your work day in the afternoon. Good amount of paid time off,,"
bad,Sysco is a very physical and extreme environment and they priority is not safety its working fast and long hours without any notice of when the day ends.
bad,Loved the coworkers i was with but management played favoritism. Giving higher positions to workers with less experience and horrible people skills. Over worked for little pay .
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"This place is a joke. One month of training and they think you can run a route like a seasoned driver. Always trying to find new stops and digging through pallets that look like they were loaded by someone purposely trying to make your day miserable. Broken pallet jacks no scanners. Management doesn't care why your running late your behind hurry up. If your over an hour behind you need to call in and prepare to be ""debriefed"" which is how they worded it in a memo the next day as to why you were behind. Too bad they treat drivers like this because with the pay and benefits offered this is how all jobs should be compensated. Just can't deal with all the BS. Run away and don't think twice."
bad,"Really one of the worst places i have every worked in my career.  The management is not strong and caters to larger pieces of business, and does appear to care about the small business owner in the industry."
bad,Heavy workload. Working at least 50-60 hours as average. Management makes changes in procedures almost every month. Petty micromanagement style. Treats accountants as machines and move them around to different roles without precaution or notification. Benefit is poor and expensive. 9/80 is practiced but working from home at nights and weekend is a norm.
bad,"Managment is worse than horrible... You get paid good in the beginning then only .20 raise every year... Little to no room for advancement... Management are the boss HR works with management to cover their azz...  Very demanding work... LM is crazy... no personal life..  "
bad,"Worked 12 hours a day just to keep up. I learned constant changes keeps the mind sharp. Department management is unorganized and inconstant. No teamwork from co-workers, and management did not care! Being held accountable for actions of sales and logistics when you have no authority or management to support you and your role!   Nothing enjoyable about the job at all!"
bad,"They don't care about your personal life.  They let me go a 89 days with no reason what so ever.  They say they don't lay people off, maybe thats true but they sure do terminate them before their 90 days.  Management plays favorites and lets people get away with things.  They are the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Between the low pay, gas / mileage on my personal car and out of pocket office expenses I could not afford to work at Sysco as a Marketing Assoicate - expected to work 24/7 - no life work balance. They will tell you they work hard and play hard, but trust me, there is no pesonal time not even when you are on vacation. Always on the phone and laptop. Expected to use personal smartphone for work, required to download Sysco apps to cell...this gives them access to ALL calls and text messages."
bad,"Corporate does things to make you work harder and doesn't care about you or your family! They changed the way the system worked because some guys was making to much money so they made it harder for us to pick but still wanted the same percentage! This company thinks they have robots or super heros or something. WAKE UP, we are only human"
bad,Pay isnt always everything
bad,This company is bad. Its treats you like dogs. They want you to do the job unsafe. The only good thing about this jobs it is UNION. And the Union does a good job to keep your job. The mangement lies to you every day.
bad,Poor management no people skills the work  hours are very inconsistent  a lot of favoritism is goin on in there lack of properly working equipment  not enough employees  there are many areas in and throughout the building that needs to be fixed
bad,"Sysco does not care about the drivers. The manager WILL NOT do anything to help his driver he spends most of his time at home sending text messages.if you have an issue he'll tell you to call someone else or that he will send an email. Loads are horrible and in the managers words they will never change."
bad,They dont pay the drivers enough for what they do at this company. You work like a dog day in and out . You are always rushing and putting yourself at risk of injury. with loaded hand trucks going down dangerous steps or up flights of stairs. Not worth it !
bad,"I worked at the hilo location for 2 years,all drivers aren't team players,I stepped up when the rest of the drivers made excuses why they couldn't put out extra,who they always leaned me,is that being ALL IN,I think not,I was being bullied for 3 months by driver for 3 months watch your back"
bad,26 years with the same company says a lot but in a year and a half in a new position changed everything. Job security and work/life balance is a thing of the past with Sysco
bad,Pas de congé férié.  Temps supplémentaire obligatoire. Travail très très physique et aucune compréhension des employeur
bad,This job is a joke warehouse workers and drivers are at war pallets are build backwards no leadership you will be diggin looking for ya product all day then they want u to stop and load a van and if the delivery time is up they want u to put stuff back on truck make no sense to finish route early they will send u to help more ppl  never same route always new places job is a joke
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Nothing to say not a good place to work this job is harder than boot camp the break are to short and they work you and don’t care about u at all that job is not worry it at all
bad,Unfair treatment by the HRBP.  She let her personal problems interfere with work so you never knew who you were going to encounter when you walked in the door.
bad,"The union protects the lazy man, the company bows to there needs, I never worked with a bunch of lazy people in all my life.0"
bad,"Terrible place to work. Destroys your body. No concern for driver safety. They push you to break hours of service and work over 16 hours in one day. High turnover for drivers and management. Warehouse picking and loading systems are terrible and put all the burden on the driver. Terrible Routing. Only good thing was the pay, you could average $3500+ every two weeks, but that’s working 65+ hours a week. No work life balance."
bad,Working at Sysco was ok till the change in focus went to strictly management making their bonuses. Then they forgot who makes them their bonuses. That’s when the loss of good drivers started and the downhill turn went to a bad work place for drivers.
bad,"This place is good as far as pay rate an hour. Your hired so other people that have already been there can sit back and watch you break your back. Typical nigh starts at 7pm and ends at 5-6am. Some of  the people with seniority talk down the new comers after 1 month. Favoritism is bad in this place, they will pick and choose who does the most work. If you don’t pull at a 95% efficiency rate they will treat you different  and talk bad about you. And threaten you with loosing your job. The work is very tedious and maticulis. if you have a family kids people you live and care for don’t apply. You will never see them or spend time with them. There are no days off with this company. You have been warned."
bad,All the management is worried about is making the numbers look good for corporate. You and your family do not matter to them. Treated unfair and never get a thank you for a job well done.  It’s pays well and good benefits but putting up with people that do not care about you gets old.
bad,70 hours a week. Equipment for a fortune 500 company is horrible if DOT was to inspect the vehicle on the yard 90% of then would fail. Mechanics dont do anything when you turn in your DVIRS. Management is always a pain and never have your back. Great money and benefits but the run you into the dirt. 6 days a week
bad,poor management always threatening to fire some one. very unethical management . I was warned by employees before I went to work for Sysco. the upper management does not know what is going on in market.
bad,"High turnover. Long hours not compensated. I liked the people I worked with. Come to work each night and expect to walk six to ten miles each night,  you have to walk to the tractors unhook them; then locate the trailers  make the hook then take that combination to the appropriate door and start all over. If you bump something don’t say nothing they will fire you, don’t believe what they say about always say something when you hit your not going to lose your job that’s a lie. If it’s not bad don’t say nothing. Upper management non caring."
bad,"So to start off the MANAGEMENT expect you to learn how to drive a pallet jack on your own for one day and expect you to be a pro at it, they lefted me alone after the first day and someone got hurt and they didn't even take the blame that they didn't train me well on it basically all MANAGEMENT are aholes and it sucks to work for them big waste of time"
bad,overworked underpaid and underlooked trailers are dirty just not a fun place various racism problems aswell especially in warehouse I only recommend if you’re in need of a job
bad,"Former driver for Sysco, left early on a two weeks notice. Ineligible for rehire because of that. Ok I understand that but rehire a former driver for cell phone use and fired him? Doesn’t seem logical to me. If a company is hurting for drivers and slim pickings as it is during a driver shortage refuse help, seems pretty unprofessional. I had a good run with this company for a long time, but honestly I’m glad I filled out an application again and was denied. Shows me things happen for a reason and the company applying for just isn’t a fit anymore due to lack of management and bias Bigotry from being mad when things don’t always go there way. I don’t recommend this company if you want to waste your time. Thank you Sysco for opening my eyes once again!"
bad,Single mans job hard work environment management has no experience in the jobs that they do all the way up to the president of Atlanta Sysco Foodservice
bad,"The pay is great but what you have to go through isn't worth it. A lot of kissing up to upper management,back stabbing,bullying and unrealistic work expectations make this a toxic enviroment. Avoid at all cost"
bad,your pay varies on how fast you can pick orders with out errors very physical demanding job always sore and frustrated people call in you work longer super high turnover rate if you cant run fast enough they let you go you can work 14 hours plus a night and basically if you have any family you will never see them because if your not at work your sleeping maybe have time to eat the paycheck is the only thing nice about this job but then again the tax man loves it too from all the over time
bad,Employees are rarely recognized for good/great job performance. They don’t offer yearly raises which is extremely discouraging which also makes monthly career development meetings a joke.
bad,"This place is cool if you don’t have no social life. Long hard days because what ever shift you work it feels like you work the same day. I worked 12a-10:30a and when i am done i felt tired all the time and i work the freezer! People that are sacrificing themselves in a cold environment and have to stay in there for a whole shift in and out to regular temps need to be paid well at least start off at 15 because that’s not cool. The start off pay is fuxking 11.68 and if you work in Freezer you get .25 cent raise, which is till less than 12. You won’t even see another raise until three months and you expect people to stay throughout that.. yeah right! If you can manage this have fun! Work elsewhere like Whole Foods where they actually care about their employees!!! Fyxk Sysco!!"
bad,"Job was terrible, expected u to pick at a 100% or u fired, they hire every 3 months because most people don’t make the cut....Also wen selecting u have a certain amount of time where u have to select.. Management  suck barely thaught u anything. Yes it’s money to be made at this company, but u have to work like a slave for it... p.s wasn’t fired I quit after 3 days.. And they don’t have no 401k...lastly they bribe u with this 4K sign up plan if u make it pass the three months, but if your percentage drop lower then a 100% u get fired and have to pay tht money back.."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Hired on full-time as a selector had two days training and thrown to wolves 99.9% struggle if you haven't stacked in a warehouse before people call in daily increasing your workload to a 13 hour day Management is fair but doesn't offer much. allowed one error per every 2500 cases is nearly impossible when equipment is fault and expect 100% productivity. If your experienced job may be for you but at 27 years old I went home sore frustrated every night only thing keeping me coming back was the paycheck.
bad,Once Sysco started downsizing in 2016 the whole work environment changed to a very stressed and unhappy work place. It became impossible to meet our Metrics with all the added work.
bad,"cool place to work, but too many people in aisles to maintain 100% weekly average. They treat probes like s***  and and really just throw you in to drown."
bad,There is no work life balance.  Management is no longer supportive.  Compensation structure makes it difficult to make a lot of money (unlike years past)
bad,"Terrible place to work, poison work environment.  Back breaking work, terrible shifts, dangerous working conditions.  Nobody cares about their job, no teamwork"
bad,"The pay and benefits were great but if you get injured doing something they tell you to do, you have a target on your back.  The union was a joke!  Lost job due to workplace injury and they would not take me back in a different position after breaking me down.  They only care about being number one and I can't wait until someone replaces them.  Do not work here.  Your life and your family life will suffer greatly!!!  Gave them 8 years I'll never get back."
bad,"Let me start this by saying that this job COULD be the best job ever, but unfortunately everything about it just sucked. They sell you the biggest bill of goods ever and pretty much do the complete opposite of what they sold you on. First off the management is absolutely atrocious, they could care less about you or your life outside of sysco, the cases that are on the truck is the only thing that matters in their eyes and if you cannot get it handled than your completely expendable. As a truck driver, you always like to see a good strong structure in terms of how your trucked is picked and loaded, and especially how it is routed but at this place it is the worst you could ever imagine. The truck is a complete train wreck, you open the back door and all of your first stops product is on the bottom of the pallets so you have to spend an extra hour just breaking it all down in your truck just to get your first stop off, and that pretty much continues the whole day, you will literally spend an extra 3 hours of day digging for product and reorganizing your truck over and over throughout the day..the loaders are just as horrible, they just throw product wherever they want to and you have to constantly climb over product to get to what you need or they just bury it all together to where you have to take everything off your truck and reorganize it yourself which eats up a massive amount of time. The routing is hideous, they don't care where you are, if they need a stop done they will send you to it, even if its an hour off your route you have to go take care of it or you get wrote up."
bad,"This company exemplifies the corporate mentality. You are a cog in the great machine, nothing more. The pay is great, and the benefits are fantastic, but as soon as they have no more use for you, you're finished."
bad,"very difficult job to work for"
bad,"I only worked here for 2 months before being told they no longer wanted me.  I thought that I was not really given a good deal because every single day as a new driver here you had a new route, so being on time and finding all stops working downtown was almost impossible.  "
bad,"The pay was great for the work performed and I thought I was going to make company.  I actually took this job serious and was running out of truck down the ramps and trying my best to perform the functions of this crazy job!  After 60 day review they let me go and I was not happy about it didn't expect it,  but kept mouth shut and just threw my stuff on table and left"
bad,This company dosent care about you. They make up guidelines like saying you have to get 100% every week just to keep your job. To get 100% you have to hold in number 1 and number 2 also skip breaks if your lucky you will get 100 %. If for example you get 98 % then you will get a letter. I can bet that none of management could even come close to getting 100%. They are all talk no show. Also the company likes to hire new immigrants to use them as slaves because they know they will not get far within the company and as soon as your close to your probation ending they will fire you. Its not worth it most american companies don't care at all. So its up to you if you like to be the pawn lol. Also lots of favouritism if they dont like you they will give you orders so high in volume that its truly impossible to 100 % unless you want to be a old depressed handicapped old man.
bad,"This was the hardest job I've ever worked. If you work here you will have no life if you're not at work you'll wanna sleep because you will work just that hard . don't get me wrong the pay is good  but you will work for it, this company is all about numbers you will have to hit a 100% production everyday if not you're out the door the turnover ratio is very high that's why they're always hiring because people just don't last so do enter at your on risk."
bad,biggest good old boy system around. if your not from pocomoke or in pocomoke fire department you mean nothing take care of who they want.
bad,"worked here in graveyard, but management is poor. they work behind your back and its really hard to work under these conditions. everybody else is great, good pay, poor hours. management need to think outside of high school and gEt to work better with the employees."
bad,good benifits
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"you are constantly under watch. someone is always out to get you fired or make your job miserable. upper management decides your fate months in advance and gives you no warning. termination is cold and quick, no second chance,no explanation. culture is me first and do whatever it takes to advance. there are no friends and trust nobody. no one cares because compensation is good and money cures all evils, for some."
bad,"Worked there for around 3 year, have to work almost every holiday, they keep them selfs understaffed so they dont have to pay extra workers. They dont listen to you suggestions to help fix some of the problems. And they let the slackers do the easy work when the guys that want to do their job get the worst work. Either way its a a great temp job to make or get you degree. Pay around 20-25 a hour if you make rate."
bad,Don’t waste your time at Sysco’s Warner’s NY. Equipment never serviced properly and management is really inconsiderate of those that are serious about getting a job done efficiently and safely.
bad,"Routers have absolutely no clue on how to schedule routes and rarely take input from delivery drivers. Truck equipment is always damaged, filthy and mgmt does nothing. Drivers are looked at as mules. Delivering food in hazardous environments, upstairs and if it was up to Sysco, drivers would be preparing the meals too in kitchens. Warehouse workers can't load trucks."
bad,Favoritism is abundant here management is absolutely horrible. Pay and benefits are good if you can deal with the work load and the rest. Would not recommend after the strike is over the work environment will be awful.
bad,"Doesnt matter how good of an employee you are, they pick and choose who stays there. Worked there for a year and didnt even know who the manager was. The tattle tailing there is ridiculous and the gate keepers are rude!"
bad,"Very little communication, poor management, toxic environment. No vacation until a year. Hard on your body and they will push you beyond it’s limits. Very common for senior drivers to have hip, shoulder, knee, replacements, as well as back problems. Equipment is junk. Drivers are miserable often yelling and arguing with management. The high pay just isn’t worth it. At my one year I’m collecting my last bonus and quitting"
bad,Worst place I ever worked. Only thing they care about is how many cases they can stuff on a trailer. Long hours everyday. Trailers are loaded incorrectly everyday
bad,"The people that load the truck do it to mess you up. Stop 16 is the First one while the stop one is on the bottom of everything else. You work for 16 hours and sleep 4 to 5 only, being a new employee sucks! They give you the worst trucks and the routes are horrible! They tell you in the interview that you going to get pay 3k every 2 weeks, that not true! When you start working with them it’s a whole another story!  It all depends on your rate so if you’re late or there is traffic you not gonna get paid the same!  You work for 16 hours without any break, you don’t eat! Because if you do, your going to get late and your paid rate its gonna go down!"
bad,"If you want to have no life, work 50 plus hours a week, wake up early everyday to get home late everyday ,and you have no family then this job is for you. They over load your trailers, things a mixed up, management sucks. they usually route you for 12 plus hours a day and if you need to work 16 they don't care."
bad,"They treat you like a wok horse they work you 14 hour days you make a mistake they try to fire you supervisors are awful no experience equipment is garbage the loads are backwards number ones at the bottom you were just picking all day while they are asking you why are you taking so long warning stay away very very stressful ,money sometimes is not everything working for them, you will eventually get hurt good luck"
bad,"They pay good but benefits pricing rises faster and a lot higher than wage increases.. There are no breaks only a 30 minute lunch no matter if you work 8 hours or 12+ hours. No time to warm up from being in freezer. Favorites are allowed to talk and goof off while others are held to job requirements. They continue to take things away ( retirement, breaks, amount of vacation hours, flexibility for dr. appt.). There is no fairness between shifts.  If you need a job then work here but if you are looking to be happy  at a job and look forward to going to work keep looking. We make production but it is never enough.  Management wants numbers and only numbers there is never a  thank you or good job. It is always they want more while offering less and less. The place is cut throat and you never feel like you are secure in your position.  There is no job security. Hourly employees are miserable. This place needs a union desperately."
bad,"There is no life/work balance.  No such thing as a weekend. Working 18 hrs per day, weekends and on holidays entirely to much work for the gain.  To much pressure puton a small group of individuals."
bad,"A lot of labor constantly non-stop  and dangerous work environment at times. I learned how to order select properly and at a sufficient pace through 10-12 hours of work. Management had a lot of favoritisms towards people and towards the work load that they gave certain employees at the company.  We got paid by percentage instead of Cases, what made it difficult and sometimes  frustrating is no matter how many cases you stay or average a night it based on the percentage that's giving. The money you made is almost convincing to stay other than that Sysco was not the job for me."
bad,"Sysco company as well as sysco products are excellent , I am a current delivery driver in NY and routes are easy . My job could be done in less than 10 hours but the problem is the force you to work on the weekends if you do lot meet DOT hours . Dispatchers are clueless and rude and management don't care about employees in all honestly,  this company could be great and one of the best to be honest but this administration needs to be replace ."
bad,"company has very poor transporation management, routing is a disaster, and communication within management is horrible,"
bad,"Worst job I ever had, most unprofessional ppl I have ever worked with. Only good thing was the ability to work from home. You make very, very little money and put a TON of miles on your car. DONT DO IT!"
bad,Worked for 7 years and they definately stopped caring about the sales crew and their quality of life
bad,"I worked 88 working days. 2 days before i would quaify for the union, i was terminated. I had just returned from time off from the death of my mother. They required a death certificate inorder for me to come back to work!!! I was given very difficult routes in Mid town Manhattan. if you dont drive for 70 hrs before saturday, you must work every Saturday. Worse comany I have ever worked for!!!"
bad,"They don't care about people they just want you to work you like a dog and get stuff out the door. They hire new people every month because no one stays, or they don't meet their standards."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,No home life because your exhausted from running all day. Don't run though because you'll be written up. Don't have kids because youll need to use a whole weeks vacation if they get sick one day. If not you'll accumulate points to be fired very quickly.  The harder you work the more work load they will put on you and take off lazy workers.
bad,"If it was possible to get rid of management and bring in people who care about the workers let alone the company itself this would be a great place to work. Ralph Miesel has probably rolled over in his grave 50+ times in the last 15 years. They talk about how much they care about safety but they don't practice what they preach. You will go out with 20,000 to 30,000lbs. of goods that you will handle every case 2,3,4 or more times."
bad,I can see why they have a high turn over rate in this customer service department. Very rude co workers. Alot of animosity with in the customer service department. Very  uncomfortable work enviroment.
bad,"Was a driver in Woodstock, a bunch of trailers were junk and management didn’t care at all, kept adding more paperwork and always asking for more out of the drivers"
bad,"Costs have been cut to the point of Absolute Dysfunction in literally all departments. Finance, Warehouse, Transportation and Maintenance all suffering with inadequate resources, direction and management to run any functional business. Work there if you have no other options or you like seeing chaos and having no sense of accomplishment at the end of any day."
bad,Hours are Monday-Thursday with a rotating Friday 6pm-whenever. Sunday is 5pm-whenever. You may work a 8 shift if everybody is holding there own. If everybody is not working then be prepared to stay late. If you get done with your work you have to pick up the slack for others that aren’t working as fast as you. Most of the employees are cool. Pay is good and that’s all that is good.
bad,"I pick order for shipping by high reach fork lift and cleaning all kinds of skids, bins and boxes. I learned and skilled up using fork lifts such as all kind of Walkie, high reach fork lifts. Management looks not bad. workplace is also good."
bad,"Total waste of time. Given a week of computer training and then thrown into a truck with zero training on the road, by myself. Expected to do the work of a 10 year vet, haa lol. Brutal, in inhuman working conditions. Constant “where are you” phone calls. This job is literally 2x as hard as Army Bootcamp, physical wise. No joke. Lasted 2 months, gave it my all but the job is not for the long term. I’m highly in shape and young, but I still have not experienced a job so brutal like that, even compared to the Army. Quite depressing watching my coworkers hobble about after multiple back and knee surgeries from the work. No thanks Sysco!"
bad,Over all terrible management from top to bottom..don't care about employees at all...tell you that you don't have to go out if no travel advised well that's not true at all..went thru every storm there was and not even a call to see how it was going ....
bad,"Really bad life work balance.They speak out of both sides of their mouth."
bad,the management sucked. will try to drive u into the ground and tell u to do stuff that you aren’t supposed to do and when u get in caught n in trouble they try cover their own buts and throw you under the bus
bad,Sysco will not allow any time for training wand will send you downtown Chicago with a trailer...then fire you if you don’t make time...good job to try if you have nothing to lose being as the pay is good
bad,They set me up for an interview and they didn't show up. Then they said I didn't show up. Horrible hiring department. I still have not heard back from them after I showed up to an interview and nobody was there.
bad,"managers unaware of company and union policies leading to disarray and disqualification of awarded transfers/bids. Long days, 14 hours or more with pressure to drive illegal."
bad,"If it werent for the rest of the workers, i would have quit years ago. my body aches constantly and management is terrible. Constant late nights, and no reprive in sight. Equipment is always broken or taken from another employee,"
bad,"Accountant's deadlines are moved up every 3 months.  Expected to close month end books without accurate information.  Double the manageable work load.  No time to review information and processed information. Also Accountant has no time to validate information.  So much falls through the cracks.  Does not matter since the company changes the information to fit what the stock holders want to see.  Turnover is terrible.  My department of 30 has lost over 17 people in 2 years.  Consistantly training new people that transfer to another track or just get out ASAP.....  RUN-DON'T ACCEPT A JOB HERE, YOU WILL REGRET IT.  You will never see your family before 7 PM again.  You will work all the holidays and weekends.   Remember SBS stands for Sysco Business Services.  This means they are trying to consolidate all 72 OpCos' accounting functions at one place with 1/3 of the staff.  You do the math.  750 people doing the work of 2250 people.  You get the picture.   Many departments have 30-40% turnover rate in 1 year.    RUN FAST!!!!!"
bad,"I worked for sysco for 13 weeks. They have a percentage standard for performance based on a goal time getting orders selected. They use an outside labor consulting firm for this. It's not fair to any one trying to keep a job there based on percentage standards, because the smaller the order selection is the easier it is to meet goal times and exceed them. So their is little too no opportunity too hold a job at sysco because there more senior employees get the mix of selecting. There percentage standard is 100% after 10 weeks of working their."
bad,Not an ideal place to work for. Management has little knowledge on how to run a huge yard. Your concerns will be noted but they will not be addressed.
bad,I worked for this company for one year.  The company is extremely using.  They paid great and offered wonderful benefits.  The management  of the company is very unusual and not inviting for a long term position.
bad,"Usually scheduled out for 12 - 15 hours daily, mismanaged from top to bottom, can't route trucks properly is what makes the job hard. Best part of job is the compensation."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"long hard days, unreasonable work load, you are not an associate you are an employee and they remind you of that every day."
bad,"The company pushes drivers to their physical limits.  Physically wears the body down.  Routinely gives drivers unrealistic times to finish work.   Only drivers that already know the routes can come close to realistic times.  Still when the warehouse packs the load the wrong way you are looking at a long day, regardless if you already know the routes...   Many better jobs out there.  This year they have to give out hiring bonuses to new hires.  Because of the reputation.  "
bad,Work is just fine but management is suspect on how they hire and fire certain employees.......
bad,One of the worst companies I have worked for! No Communication between management and employees. Does not take the proper actions when need. Always changing you schedule without letting you know and changing your days off every week. Not paying there signing bonus like they say only seen 500 out of a 5000 signing bonus! Pay is good but that don’t make up for all the other shady stuff
bad,Good for people with fancy degrees. You can become a Manager from an intern in less than 3 years if you have good fancy degree. No one cares about experience and/or strong foundation
bad,"In the beginning I thought this would be a perfect job. The company seemed great, if it wasn't for the HR director. She was  controlling, rude, and a complete micro-manager! I was only allowed to take lunch at a certain time, she would count every minute of work, and you weren't allowed to leave until 5:00 pm, to the minute. The company is also a bit outdated. I think working in the military would have been more enjoyable. It's sad the the company doesn't see why people leave, and it's usually based on ONE bad manager or director. Sysco don't keep bad managers!"
bad,"Risking employees safety, by re-welding bent/broken support braces, that holds 30+ tons."
bad,"It used to be the best in the industry. The company is slowly progressing towards a financial cliff that will leave it paralyzed to compete. It’s just a large, flavorless company."
bad,"Not the best place after a couple years of selling.  The compensation structure does not align with future advancement.  The most seasoned and best reps do not stick around after 3-4 years, because their pay structure model ""caps"" out.  Will be on-call essentially 7 days per week, 24 hrs per day.  Management at each distribution center differs dramatically.  Margins in the industry keep declining, yet their stock keeps going up.  That right there tells you that compensation and advancement opportunities are not going to be available."
bad,This place SUCKS the only thing sysco can promise you is that your back will messed up in a few years the route the routes all wrong almost every customer you go to they always complaining how bad sysco is you spend most your time digging for 1 piece that is probably on the very bottom of the pallet SYSCO SUCKS STAY AWAY
bad,I did not like the Sysco out by Norman. They have young incompetent Supervisors. Plan on working 530pm to 6 or 7am because they have no idea what they are doing.
bad,"I've been here for about a year now and this company is terrible. For being the biggest food distributor in America you would think the pay would be decent but I know janitors at other warehouses that get paid more than I do. There's absolutely no room for job advancement no matter how much experience you have because whoever is in favor with the warehouse manager will get the position. Incentive is a joke. No matter how hard you work, the ""bonus"" isn't worth it. You never get hours so you're always stuck with 30 something hours a week with no chance of overtime."
bad,If you want to work for the biggest company in the food service industry cool but that doesn't mean it is the best. They do offer good benefits but man everyday your load is screwed up bad. They have the absolute dumbest people that stack the pallets and load trailers. Makes your day as a delivery driver that much more stressful. You can make money here but you gotta be willing to go help out other drivers once you have did your route.
bad,"During my employment at sysco there were changes frequently made to management. No supervisor really knew what they were there for & all of them were in their own way shady. It is a great company to make money with, but wayyyyy too many politics . If you rubbed elbows with the right ones then you would be ok. Like plenty of the associates who have the president's number & have managers taking their drug test. I was let go because the nurse swapped my drug sample because she is the mother in law of one of the supervisors who hated me for being a woman. I have not partook in any drugs in 2 years & mysteriously my drug test came back positive for marijuana, & then you have to pay 150 to have it retested !!! They play favorites alot and nepotism is at its finest !! Sysco is good to get in and get out , other than that stay away !!!! They pay you to slave you , your body will definitely hate you later."
bad,"The machines they give the employees have no brakes and once you make note of this your told to learn your equipment. I ran into a stack of pallets due to no brakes and supervisors just looked at me and kept on about their way. The pay balance is way off, how someone who started a month month 1/2 before me get paid more with less experience?  Union base yet all union rules are being broke daily by management and once I was told the company will not do anything if a grievance was filed on the issue.  I've seen two people get injured at work and they both had to continue working, the company is more worried about keeping damaged product down yet the selection goes over 8 feet high.."
bad,"Most days you'll work at least 12 hours throughout the year. In the summer up to 16 hours. You'll start every morning between 12am and 5am, but each day you won't know when your start time is or where you're going till 8pm the night before. Fortunately they legally have to give you 10 hours off between each shift as a driver, but I doubt they would if the didn't have to. If you come in as a helper, sometimes you might get less than 10 hours off. "
bad,I worked for this company for 2 months.They over work you .The management for the drivers sets you up to fail.If you like working for Hitler then this is the company for you .Thay realy dont care about you .They have camaras in the trucks watching you .
bad,The pace of this job is such that you have to run with the product on a dolly. Everything is dollied in  to the customer. The product is loaded in  the truck very poorly where you will have later stops product loaded on top of current stop product. Sometimes the pallets are loaded backwards where first stop is loaded in the nose of the trailer and the last stop is loaded in the back of the trailer.
bad,This place demeans people everyday and no one especially in management is ever held accountable in fact they may get a promotion out it. Out of date and constantly broken equipment and having to fight for your money
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Management horrible. Dies not set a good example for employees. Very uncomfortable work environment. So very stressful. No team flow. Poor training. Work environment very loud for position to be performed affectively.
bad,Crazy place to work. The third shift is like a jungle. You'll find plastic bags and straws in the bathrooms. Management is very poor. And Lord behold don't have a Dr's appointment.
bad,"This is a very face paced job, and can be very rewarding if you are project oriented.  Often you are surrounded my people with much slower paced jobs that will give you more assignments, and that can get annoying."
bad,"Great company for those entering the job market and want to gain experience in distribution.  The employees are the best part, management can be micro mangers."
bad,Sysco's IT division has bad management with very limited growth. Management will railroad you constantly. I would not make this a permanent job. The Sysco culture from an IT perspective is to be a kiss a*s. The managers will not support you.
bad,"•         Blackberry Manager Administrator capabilities"
bad,"Unstable work environment, trucks are always loaded backwards on a 28 ft trailer. Management expects you to deliver on time but half the time you cant find the product. I could go o. And on but i dont have enough characters in my review"
bad,Aggressive micromanagement. Aggressive competition encouraged to the point of zero trust between colleagues. Walking on eggshells 24/7. Unless you’re at the round table once a month you’re at the bottom of the food chain. Run by relatively new president like a caste system setting us back a century or two. Extremely disappointing and unsettling work experience. I wish I never worked there.
bad,customer service oriented business that drives quality through food service by offering fresh quality products for a variety of small and large businesses.
bad,The company is trying to improve. Directors and Upper Staff Have limited understanding of what is required to fully create Autonomous teams. The Sr. Director of Transformation doesn't know Agile.
bad,Drivers and warehouse personnel are overworked.  Rarely do people feel a sense of accomplishment as they can never finish the tasks they're issued within the time constraints.
bad,"I would not recommend this company. Does not give adequate time to develop relationships. "
bad,"Pay scale is not bad, but not worth it when compared to the work they expect from you as a order selector. Just think of being at a war everyday go go go like a machine for numbers they want from you. They keep u part-time for about 3-4 years to get the best use of you moving hours and workdays here and there according to how much work they have and then consider you full time if u can last. Good luck man."
bad,"Not a good environment for me or the other workers there, very unorganized workplace, slave labor in my honest opinion and somewhere I wouldn’t refer my worst enemy to apply for!"
bad,I worked fr om sun up to sundown.  no time for family affairs.  No help from my manager when needed.   Too many reps in one territory.  Causing very few leads to get new business.
bad,"No territory protection, terrible commission structure,lack of planning by management.Lack of support from management."
bad,"Hard work,  which is not a bad thing, its something I actually enjoyed, but when the new transportation manager came in also corporate set a bunch of new rules. People started dropping like flies either getting fired or quit....when that happened we were under 50% staffed, for 3 months I was working 6 days every other week for 12-14 hours a day! Their seems to be a little favoritism to certain individuals not having to work weekends, when I brought it up to the new transportation manager she said call her on Monday, so I did left a message, then again on Tuesday then Wednesday......you get the picture.....This was our Transportation Manager! for a month she never called me back......well on my last day I made sure to call her and of course  she didn't answer left her a long message on how terrible morale was and how the last 4 drivers they had were all looking elsewhere{well 3 there fav wasn't}....she finally called back and she totally was shocked and actually said she wished I had brought my grievances to her earlier? This is how disillusioned they are at Sysco Jacksonville{don't know about the others}pay was good only reason I didn't give them higher marks on pay is because its lumped with benefits and health ins is outrageous I grossed 74,000 last year and just health ins for a family was 20,000, remember just health not dental 401k or any taxes, an co pay was 20.00 and 1500 deductible per person.........maybe that's everywhere but its a big chunk....though I would've dealt with all that,  if they just would've answered the phone and just pretended to care....they didn't"
bad,"There is a lot of change going on with management. Management needs more training dealing with fellow employees."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"I started to work at this company and on the fist day I felt like I joined Some cult.  Management is very rude as to even blame you for their work issues.  This company will write you up every time your late or caught taking a brake.  There is no overtime, no breaks,  if the truck breaks down it's your fault,  one of my managers threw a bottle at my feet, it smashed and I got written up for breaking glass on the doc.  This position is pure EVIL .  Every Driver at this job is looking for other work to do, so they can quit this job. I have never in my 18 years of driving ever seen anything like the clowns at this place. before wasting your time filling out the on Line application, read the comments people are posting..  THIS JOB IS NOT WORTH IT."
bad,This company sucks they make you feel like your gonna get fired every day. Management is horrible . No days off   Good if u don't have a life work.
bad,awful expierence hire you at part time status to save money on benefits you often have to wait a year to get them then its with a 1000 doller deductable
bad,"Sysco is one of the largest food distribution companies in the world, however,  the branch I worked at has a very poor management culture, long hours, and a very politically driving environment. Compensation is good for the hours worked, however, management see's you as just a number to exploit for gain bonuses for themselves."
bad,"I have worked many jobs in my life. I have never felt so overworked in my life. And because your pay is based on performance, if you're not athletic, for about making top pay."
bad,I've been driving for sysco riverside for over one year. Myself along with other drivers are getting ready to get out.  Drivers are treated horrible and management is horrible.  Too many chiefs!
bad,"Get ready to have your spirit crushed into the dirt. You will work 12+ hours a day with tech strapped to your wrist and waist. Always a slave to time and your oppressive management team, you will be hoping for a break like any normal job.. but if you take more than half an hour for lunch, watch those numbers and your pay drop.. the system is rigged against you."
bad,If your a yes man type worker this is for you. If you want to have a life and spend time with your family good luck with this job. Supervisors and dispatch and routers are the worst. Apply at your own risk!
bad,New hire starts in dry then moved to companies desire location. poor equipment to work with like gloves and hot hands for cold and freezing temps. And half working scanners. Don't miss a day of work because your equipment will be replaced with  misfiring equipment ( printer & scanner).  don't do to good in the dry like a 100% in the first week or you would be sent to cooler or freezer to work for good in all attempt to say their cross training you. Poor management. Now life balance. Easy batches for special people.
bad,"No time for family . Work long hours about 16 every night , one day off (during the week) , horrible management and no one cares about you . Very frustrating"
bad,"Very unorganized and unionized.  Supervisors have no guidance, training or backing.  Drivers have to deal with very rude and incompetent manager and director and supervisors."
bad,"Employees are very hard working, long work days.Decent benefit package, but could do better. Always unexpected layoffs, heavy workloads, many deadlines to meet each week."
bad,My typical day at work included safety training and compliance auditing.  The atmosphere at Sysco was tense as it seemed that management and employees were often at odds for one reason or another.  Managerial support for safety improvements left much to be desired.
bad,You are basically a strong back with a CDL ...the work is very physically and mentally draining and by the time you get home you are too tired to do anything with your family so forget about having much of a family life and there is no room for advancement for drivers no matter how good you are at your job you will be stuck in a drivers position.
bad,"The company preaches a lot about ethics and doing the right thing. But nobody actually does, the culture is literally on paper only no one follows it at all. It is a very toxic environment a very selfish place to work, nobody wants to share any knowledge in fear of advancing other people's career instead of theirs. They always look at people's age and gender when hiring for physical jobs and turn away (women and older people) which is highly unethical someone should look into that!"
bad,Some managers do not know the inter-workings of their own department. Management does not understand or even know what their own employees do. Managers seem to not follow the same set of rules that all associates must follow. Management also does not listen or care for new ideas that could possibly help make things more efficient for the department and company.
bad,"The management has a ""good 'ol boy club"".  I was a freezer selector, one of the top in the warehouse.  The minute I spoke up I had a target on my back, dispite great performance.  The environment is very cut throat and everyone there is very selfish since your prefomace determined your pay.  The way their percentage works and the layout of the warehouse it's easy to get a drop in pay.  Be ready to work breaks cheat the system, just don't say anything!"
bad,"Poor management, very cut throat as in they will terminate you for not making percentage! This is a job for young men without any children or hopes of having a social life. Very physically demanding job!!!  The pay is good and the benefits are ok, but the way you are treated as a person is somewhat lacking."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,There was a lot of favoritism at the job in terms of certain workers getting the highest paying trucks considering the job was a production pay job and sometimes i would be sent home early short of how many hours i was told i would be working.
bad,"Management will pile loads of things on your work load and when you ask for help, they are less than willing to support. Its great building your own schedule and the relationship with my customers is amazing. I just wish management cared about my customers as much as i did."
bad,"unfair wages, management doesn’t care, my supervisor played favoritism like crazy with other people leaving early when they missed a day. you work hard for nothing in return. people are nice sometimes. team work is a must here. it’s just a paycheck. some people overdo themselves and hurry up and some people do absolutely nothing but check their phones and play around."
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for. The loads have gotten worse and the drivers are making less money. Management seems to be ok with it and have the attitude that we should be happy to be working here. Looking at taking a $10,000 cut this year compared to last year. No thanks!"
bad,"My peers were wonderful. However I can't say that about the upper management at this facility. Very negative atmosphere, not focused on truly being your customers best business partner."
bad,"A good place to work if you are willing to work 6-7 days per week. "
bad,"I have never experienced the political infighting that I witnessed in this organization anywhere including the military.  Other department heads will appear cordial until you can't deliver something that they feel is a priority regardless of cost, feasibility and current regulations.  Do NOT turn your back as there could be something sticking out of it!"
bad,"Long hours, not any consistent routes.  Cut/throat environment.  Management is difficult and rude.  Pressure to finish in unreasonable time.  The pay is incentive, that sucks!"
bad,Worked for this company for almost 19 years . Customers are ALWAYS right and what THEY say is more to company than support the employees. They treat you like slaves and always require more . Corporate ran company with zero appreciation for the driver ......... DONT NOT WORK HERE !!!!!
bad,they did not value long term employee's the only way to grow in the company if you were part of the boy's club and no women was allowed unless you were blond and a size 2
bad,"No territory protection, terrible commission structure,lack of planning by management.Lack of support from management."
bad,"Needs better training. Overall, I enjoy the gained knowledge and years of experience that have opened many doors for me."
bad,"Pay/Benefits are good,Its a strong company to work for,but no room for advancement.No set routes to start with and hours are strenuous. Anywhere from 8 to 16 hour work days. Its very physically demanding."
bad,I went to a community college to seek out employment in the heavy diesel technology . After one (1) year I knew I made a mistake. after finishing school and finding out the company did not have the state of  the art equipment to work on heavy equipment I knew I was in trouble. So I started to seek a new profession.What I do now in the pharmaceutical business is one of the best things I did.
bad,"•	Protects company property from destruction and theft. "
bad,"It is a turn and burn place to work, especially in Sales. The atmosphere is toxic. Operationally Sysco does things right. The problem is, they don't care about their employees and turn over is huge."
bad,Not a good place to work for no communication and play favorites and pay scale is way out of wack.Suppose to b a set pay but some drivers get paid way more then others if your in the click
bad,Have enough people to do all the extra work that keeps on getting created from corporate. Quit initializing new systems that dont work. Being our customers most valued partner are just words.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,All this company care about is money get yours and move on it’s that simple no need to try and make a career out of this unless u really like doing labor and having to deal with bs everyday money decent though
bad,"It starts with the pallets being built awful, you can have 900 cases on your truck but your gonna touch at least 1800."
bad,They flat out told me not to waste time with smaller accounts... Those smaller accounts wouldn't move the needle enough... I...was...floored! It makes me so made that I used them as a distributor when I had my restaurant.
bad,"Training is terrible for the amount of work load and systems you will need to use. Your constantly digging and researching to try to fix problems from every angle Constant fires. You are responsible for 150 customers dealing with problems from logistics, pricing, coordinating with buyers, out of stock items, contract compliance and special orders. Your phone rings nonstop u will get 100 emails a day and customers constantly trying to push back with u and yell at u for Evey issue!"
bad,Not many ethnics or culture in the facility they can change your routes as a new employee not knowing area no matter the conditions inadequate truck monitor equipment
bad,Company culture requires to drive sales that does not always benefit the employees. Company and management continues to restructure always changing positions. Provides great health benefits and package.
bad,"Once a great company that has been taken over by numbers. Each operating company used to be almost self-sufficient, but that has gone away in recent years, with corporate directing every job and function that takes place. They no longer care about the individual employee"
bad,Sysco is a very hard place to work. Unacceptable management if you work hard yo are expected to do the other guys work who doesn’t work hard. Very poorly managed and the pay should be better
bad,You will work seven days a week and you will not be able to take vacation. Only positive is their training program. Sysco has the best training for their MA's.
bad,Health and safety issues are a huge problem at this site. If you mention it to management you'll be fired. The contractors the have working for them are just as shady. Tons of gossipy types. Not a good place to work at all. Upper management is always blaming everybody for their own mistakes
bad,Sysco Corp is cutting costs by cutting employees. You are just a number with no job security. They have good benefits but there is little opportunity for growth unless you intend to move to their corporate location.
bad,I have nothing positive to say the accounting manager was awful she was hateful and did not treat any of her emplyees right. the job I loved just the management team
bad,Sysco allows you to work remotely and manage your day to day activities.  I've learned about many program applications to complete my tasks.  Management could be more supportive.  A good workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job is working 7 days a week with no cut offs for personal time.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being autonomous.
bad,"Not a good experience working for Sysco.  Got hurt on the job, driving in Northern NH Rte 302, hit several moose, scary scenario.  Not much of a support system after being injured."
bad,"I have never worked for a company that literally makes the schedule up as they go. Realize that when the change the schedule for one person on one side of the state it will ripple through and change 5 to 10 more peoples schedule for the week. This company feels a lot of pressure from corporate to keep cost down (employees) so they run with the very minimal number of workers. I have been lied to multiple times just so I would cover other schedules, management is really lacking. Employees literally throwing up in/out the back of the trailers and asked to keep working. Hurt, sick, family emergence, it doesn’t mater. They don’t have the extra employees to cover and won’t hire them. Almost all the high up management is in the late 50’s or 60’s and on there way out, basically doing bare minimum on the moral front for the guys, its pretty sad. In recent month it has been a struggle for them to even hire local drivers because there reputation is getting to be so bad. So if you don’t have kids or a family that you like to spend consistent time with you will be fine here."
bad,"Not for everyone. Must be willing to withstand some pretty stressful situations for sometimes low pay. Some love it, some hate it. I don't think there is much of a middle ground."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"The worst is how they load the truck. Stop 1 under stop 2,3,4,5,6,7 in a 28foot trailer. It really sucks."
bad,Poor management and absent leadership 
bad,"All the pieces are here for an excellent career, management is unable to put those pieces together correctly. Regularly routed for a 12-14 hour day, six days a week. This could be a great place but currently continues its downward spiral. Even a Colombian coffee bean carrying mule gets occasional time off. If you like your family time, this is not a job for you."
bad,"my experience working here was so bad that I rather not say anything about it. Sorry."
bad,The pay at Sysco was pretty good but was hard to earn incentive pay. Was a very stressful work environment and needed inprovment in many areas. A typical day at work can go either very smooth to rough. I learned to operate an sos unit while scaning and printing labels. The culture in the workplace could go from being friendly to unfriendly very fast. The hardest part of the job was keeping a good work pace while lifting very heaving product all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and food they would serve sometimes.
bad,"Sysco Memphis was not founded on the basis of inclusion. The sales force is comprised of 4 minorities out of 367. All decisions within the company are based on ""like-ability"" rather than are you qualified for the job. HR Dept is a complete joke and lack the competence to be engage with the employees. Cohesiveness and trust are obsolete within the company. The overall culture of the company is a antiquated and unproductive."
bad,"I thought for the size of this  company that things would be  awesome, but the re-organization of  ALL departments is a must, the  safety culture is not present and people are not convinced since Upper management are not  much convinced into safety  awareness. "
bad,it is very stressful. You have little home time. They make good money. Trucks are overloaded and you have no help. They work you like machines. Not a good company to balance with family.
bad,"Work was unrealistic and management didn't make it seem doable. "
bad,All aspects of the company are driven toward adding to the bottom line of the company.  Employees are shown little value and are churned on a regular basis.  Marketing Associate is expected to work Sunday through Friday with mandatory 4 hour sales meetings every Friday including once a month 8 hour meeting.  Employee moral is poor and politics run rampant.
bad,"No company culture.  Hierarchical structure with disinterested Executives. Lack of open and honest communication. Compensation can be attractive, based on sales."
bad,"Long work days, your workday is always on edge daily. Management wasn't the best. They always add extra work to your workday regularly. Even though we worked 4 days you was on call for that 5th day and it wasn't pretty."
bad,"Working for the corporate or business office is tiring. They expect you do be able to carry the weight of 3 people when others get fired, leave. They do not hire new people, they only divvy out more responsibility to the point no one is happy anymore."
bad,"Sysco is the largest food distributor in the world. However they have a very small market share in the Western, Pa / Pittsburgh market. They have been trying for years to gain market share and have gone about it all wrong. Instead of letting Marketing Associates build relationships in the area they hire too many sales people and they are literally tripping over one another. (They have 100 but only need about 50). Sysco Pittsburgh has been doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result and accounts are passed around far too much for anyone to really do well. If you are looking for a stability and the opportunity to build a nice book of business I'd apply elsewhere."
bad,"On-call day "
bad,The Talent Acquisition Department has a very high turnover rate. A lot of talented people end up getting fired or just plain leaving on their own.
bad,Prefer not to discuss the company per company policy. The company had great benefits and some great staff members.
bad,Terrible senior management. They couldnt handle the day to day changes let alone the big changes coming.
bad,6 day work week. Staffing was not properly handled. Work/Life balance was not there. Disconnect between sales and transportation
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Great Benefits, but upper management very poor!"
bad,Unless desperate for job and in Olympic athlete shape...job will tear your body down. Cameras in truck cab watch your every move. Driver always GUILTY until proven INNOCENT when customer calls into complain. Management play favoritism with drivers who brown nose....but in a way (you can not prove) to protect themselves. 18 years...nothing changed...finally said enough is enough.
bad,"As a mid level manager you make less than union employees beneath you. You can never do enough, and there is no loyalty for an employee who does the right thing year after year after year,"
bad,"If you enjoy food, this is a great career, if you are located in a market that is truly effected by the economy it if very difficult to make a living. You are competing against resturant depot, costco, smart n final, very difficult to match there pricing."
bad,"See summary... Pretty self explanatory. Communication within management regarding transfers, new accounts, and overall help contingent on if you deer hunt or play golf."
bad,Work hours are ideal
bad,"By the time they got their training class ready, we had all forgotten we had applied.  The trainer told us there was no way she could teach us everything, that we had to learn basically on the floor.  Then, the Supervisor would rudely say, ""Go ask one of your co-workers,"" who would answer with attitude.  The manager would belittle you if you pointed out a flaw in the system.  Rewards were quarterly, not monthly; and, was lunch with your supervisor, who was a jerk.  Christmas bonus was a bag of candy fit for a 4 yr. old.  No raises & they'd jump all over your back for the tiniest mistake.  I got fired for following company procedures.  Customers always upset because drivers were under so much pressure they'd make huge mistakes, and curse at the customers.  All they care about is money.  One customer told me he only saw his sales rep once, and after that just got 1 call encouraging him to order more.  They would substitute their brand for other brands & not pass on savings.  They would try to collect on debts 10 yr.s old instead of writing them off.  Fired sales reps with 20 yr.s tenure for not producing 'up to standards.'  Once whole area crew of sales reps left to work for a competitor who paid them more.  Downsized and forced tenured reps to take a huge pay cut to keep their job.  Typical corporate company.  Only didn't outsource 'cuz needed English speaking people to take orders.  Will treat you like a robot and fire you for the tiniest mistake."
bad,Would not recommend this job if your looking for something long term. Helps build a decent work ethic but often unappreciated. Speaking from a selectors perspective.
bad,"Solid work.  A lot of work, but pays better than most in the area.  Worked with some managers and employees that were really fun and hard working.  I would go back."
bad,"When I was employed here management would reserve certain batches for who they wanted. They would make it easier for some people to make there money. I’ve seen certain types of employees fired for having too many eras and other employees that had more eras not get fired. Management would give preferential treatment to certain employees based on who they had relationships with outside of work.  It’s not like I couldn’t do the job, I was awarded order selector of the year. Management made the job easy for who they wanted and hard for who they wanted."
bad,"A very cut throat environment. Poor management that definitely wasn't transparant or trustworthy.. If you were the DSM's buddy he would see to it that you were given accounts to work, while others received nothing and struggled to build their business..Certain Male managers constantly made lewd and sexually inappropriate comments to female sales reps. The list goes on"
bad,Worst place I ever worked. Injury rate is astronomical because you will never be good enough or quick enough. The harder you push the more they expect.
bad,"When I first started working for the company about 13 years ago, it was a great place to work. Fast forward, now the company is going downhill. Witnessed an awesome and well liked forklift operator get passed over for a daytime position in which he applied for. The position was given to another forklift operator who isn't even comparable to the guy who has been in the position longer. Could be a race thing, who knows.....my opinion. Company no longer values the importance of family as it relates to work/life balance. Christmas, of all holidays should be given as an automatic day off for all employees, not just daytime workers. The night crew are not respected and treated unfairly. Management needs a facelift,  beginning with the night shift director, by the way who hasn't been in the position long enough. Scheduling is a nightmare due to stupid ideas of upper management. A system that worked prior to the scheduling mayhem worked.  Entire company needs an overhaul."
bad,Constant change for no reason. 7 bosses in 4 years who never took the time to figure out what our department did because there was no reason to. Upper management was going to change their role.
bad,"Ok company, very little support for management team from senior management. Working schedule takes toll on personal life and not taken into consideration."
bad,"Terrible experience do not work here unless you enjoy long hours, low pay and a terrible work life balance! The leadership is only focused on making sure they get all the credit. Turnover is non-stop due to poor leadership and no accountability or integrity from the president on down!"
bad,Management has no idea what is going on. There is no room to grow and there is no job security. Positions continue to be eliminated. Pay is below most companies for what you do and don't even think about lodging a complaint about anything because they don't care and won't do anything about it
bad,"Indeed has given me the opportunity to write a review about Sysco"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Good co workers ,poor management and very petty about the little things but do not stick to their word on pay raises and is so micro managed that there is no face to face communication at all between employees and supervisors it’s all electronically done. The supervisors and managers they try and penny pinch so much money during the year so they will get that big bonus at the end of the year and the shop and it’s employees suffer because of their greediness.unless you are a part of the warehouse or delivery drivers you don’t make a good living and you don’t matter to the calera sysco house all you are is a expense to them just a money pit and all you are is a number to them"
bad,"When I started Sysco it was a great company to work for and we had great management that had succeeded in getting everyone working well together with a mutual respect for each other. When they changed the President of the company and when someone disagreed with him, he would fire upper management.  The replacement management, did not work well with the employees, and did not know what they were doing, so i found a company that appreciated my quality of work and experience and decided to leave the company"
bad,"A very stressful workplace, They care nothing about you only getting their product off of the truck regardless of how. They will tell you to do 1 thing and then write you up for doing what they asked later."
bad,Current leadership is missing the boat.  They will not promote from within.  Many tenured employees are leaving.  They have not connected with the employees.  The environment is toxic.  It's been brought to managements attention but ignored.
bad,The new manager is cutting everything including pay. The lose of customers is being compensated for by stretching the routes out farther. This creates conflict in customer delivery windows and adds a great deal of stress to the drivers.
bad,"8 to 5 ""metric"" driven, data entry, analytical  call center environment. Depending on what department , leadership, and team you work for your career could flourish or decline quickly. Sink or Swim is the motto. Workplace culture is like the game show ""Survivor"" or the movie ""Hunger Games"". Getting caught up or dragged down in team alliances seems inevitable.  You have to be in the right crowd, on the right team, in the know, in the right atmosphere, to get promoted, to get trained or just move around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with bitter, resentful, fickely tenured employees who would be ready to throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. Its the system, Its big business, its globalization and nwo smack in your face, double whammy. Truth. Unfortunately, the most enjoyable part of the job is getting a paycheck. But going to the gym and learning something new about the business from random folks outside the department is also a plus."
bad,"It's sad to say that in 2018 they are still somewhat of a ""good old boy"" network. It's not what you know it's who you can step on to get to the next level.  The pay is fair and the benefits are decent but the HR team isn't helpful - it's all offsite, managed by a third party team.You're there to serve a purpose and everyone gets a pretty similar rating for their annual reviews - and your score doesn't impact the raise that is received. If you do your job well you'll do fine and even be appreciated for your contributions."
bad,my typical day would be 
bad,Highly competitive with office politics and favorites.  Lots of moving parts and sometimes difficult to get tasks accomplished without waiting for someone else to do their job.
bad,I am expected to do the job of three because my boss doesn’t want to speak up. Other locations have two to three people doing what I do but my location wants to save money and overwork me.
bad,I provided technical support for the office and warehouse staff. I was asked to attain certifications in order to provide warranty work on the Sales Teams laptops and I would be provided a good increase in pay.. Once I attained certifications; I rebuilt 150 laptops within a month. When it came time to provide me a raise; I was given a nickel per hour. When I asked for more; it was not only denied but I was asked to leave.
bad,"Fast paced, and pushed hard no concern for driver safety very difficult work unloading the products. Good pay and benefits unlimited hours during the summer"
bad,"At Sysco, you will never be looking for work. Management does not work to keep staff,  and a high turnover means the drivers we have are overburdened. The equipment is barely maintained, the warehouse staff are overworked and underpaid, which makes your truck a mess when loaded. Your hours are long, overtime every single day. Very odd hours, you will get up before your spouse, and be home tired and in bed before suppertime. Not a family job."
bad,"This company is stranger than fiction. I could write a book about it. Sysco is the epitome of what is wrong with large corporate cultures today. I've never worked with so many passive-aggressive people. A recurring theme for Sysco is to lay-off the great, knowledgeable employees and keep the ones that causes everyone to say ""why are they still here?"" As mentioned, this company is stranger than fiction."
bad,"No work/life balance. Focus is lost by senior management quickly changing from one ""focus"" to the next. Little support from manager at district level or at OPCO level."
bad,"Although my direct boss was great, the executive team did not provided the resources needed to achieve their goals.  There have been major changes made recently that I believe could improve the environment."
bad,"Sysco is an average place to work at. People are friendly, competition is heavy. Not much teamwork. Go through a 7 week training program. Need to pay attention."
bad,"A great place to start.  You become accustomed to long hours and sometimes a 6 or 7 workweek, not ideal for a work life balance.  Great people.   Lifelong friendship."
bad,"This is a multi-tasking job that has management spouting flavor of the week tasks. They often talk out of both sides of their mouth and expect you to reach goals with limited supplies and proper running tools to do the job right."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"The only good thing being employed  with sysco is decent money and good benefits. Besides that the management sucks, your forced to work ridiculous hours, and there is absolutely no home life unless you deprive yourself from sleep which only makes your work that much harder."
bad,Horrible Management. I had 5 different managers in two years. All from Verizon Warless and had no experience in the hospitality industry.
bad,Great place to work with plenty of opportunities to move within the company.  Very demanding and rewarding at the same time.
bad,"You're gonna work long hours for people who will never care one iota for you.  However, you'll make a  bunch of money from them and have teamsters benefits along the way.  can you handle that arrangement?"
bad,"Scheduled  maintenance work and repairs hard to get done as it conflicts with emergency repairs every night as Post Trip Inspection issues would have to be resolved as fleet would prepare to leave for deliveries early morning. One mechanic gets overwhelmed getting fleet out. It would be better to have two mechanics on 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM shift. Good pay and benefits but, burnout from workload frequent. Family life can be negatively effected, as was my experience.  Hardest part of job was doing without teamwork environment. Best part is benefit package."
bad,A typical day was getting into your territory before 8am.  Cold calling at least 20 places that offered some sort of food service a day and assisting current customers in their weekly orders.  Making sure you are as accurate as possible and try to gain larger orders by noticing products that you were not currently selling to the  customer.
bad,I worked fro this company for 6 years and now I am looking to move on.
bad,"I work at this company for roughly six months. Only got two days training and was told to do the best you could. I saw other drivers get the two weeks as promised. Constant turn over rate. I saw about 10 drivers come and go. Either quit or got fired. Even saw the transportation director get canned. Poorly taken care of equipment and out of date tractors. Mine hardly ever started and I never knew where I was going from day to day. The union is a joke also. Hopefully if you don't mind working 60-70 hours a week than maybe you will last as long as I did. A typical day was between 800 to 1000 cases and 12-16,stops. Also the trucks only do 60mph."
bad,Lousy company to work for.  Management does not keep their word
bad,"This company has a strict hierarchy, average pay, and lacks modern systems and technology. It is very similar to a government organization."
bad,Good Company to work for and received discounts on certain items.
bad,"This job was not all challenging, it was more like go to customer and take the order. The customers had no loyalty they bought just on price points. The managers did not do a good job training, they were always putting out fires with customers. Most of the co-workers were not happy. The hardest part was to stay focus and get motivated for the job, you did the same thing every week. I enjoyed meeting the customers and buliding realtionships."
bad,They watch you at all times.
bad,"Work place was not fun Management made sure of that. They kept looking for ways to get around the Union to fire people. Then when they found the Shop Stuart dirty (doing drugs) they kept him. So anytime management wanted to fire someone the Shop Stuart would turn play dumb or he wasn't there until you had your hearing. then the hearing was during the day so you got the day shift stuart (I worked the night shift) who didn't know anything about your Grievance. The Business agents they don't care. The company is a great company but, greedy. They provide alot of amenities that you don't see at other companies such a cafeteria, weight room, tv, bbq on Thursdays, and a pool table. Take away that management team in the warehouse and you have a real good comany."
bad,"too much favoritism...and your work isn't appreciated  and noticed unless you make a mistake by other's lack of communication."
bad,"worked a lot of hours was hard to have a life outside of work, was short staffed and worked bad hours. pay was good sometimes felt underappreciated..."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,They say they want you home safe with your family but your forced mandatory overtime to help other drivers who are slackers and your working minimum 55 hrs a week what it comes down to that the drivers get sh—t end of the deal
bad,Managememt in the fleet shop needs help overbearing ruler. Mean person to everyone. Some hired help quit after 1 day. Lack of help on 3rd shift shop. U always going backwards not moving forward.
bad,"No work  life balance, unrealistic goals & targets. pay not good  compare  to industry  average. poor management style , no room for advancement. "
bad,"Sysco is a revolving door with their managers.  Every one they hire, is worse than the next.  "
bad,I was a fueler there job started from 2 11:30 p.m. field 150 trucks a day back and forth back and forth in and out in and out of each truck very stressful job
bad,"This position depends entirely on the territory you take over. If sales goals aren't met, your time with the company is limited. Sysco is often times the most expensive of the 3 largest companies and they rely on other methods to gain customers such as technology, menu design, etc. All these extra duties are simply more time spent for the same salary."
bad,"No work life balance at all!!!!.... When I was there the standard work day was 14 to 16 hours based on a terrible operations plan from upper management.  Upper management had no Idea of how to schedule supervisors and managers so they could be efficient without failing from exhaustion.  All Labor was driven by sales, not quality.  "
bad,"has become very corporate and impersonal new management does not value people and they pile on work you basically work 7 days a week and are just told ""that is the way it is """
bad,This would be a great place if they had better Directors who knew how to lead people. They also have very complicated work processes. I have worked here less than a year and am already looking for my next opportunity.
bad,"Sysco thinks that they own your life when you drive for them. You start between 3 and 5 in the morning, and you finish as soon as you get your route done. You have a base route, but they routinely add extra stops onto your route; however, you won't know whether or not you have extra stops on your route until you show up for work that morning. They routinely add stops to your route so you are scheduled to work 12-16 hours per day, so don't plan on being able to be able to schedule appointments or get anything other than work done during the day."
bad,"There are 3 guys that have been there more than 3 years and they bring the culture down. The supervisors show to much favoritism. The turnover ratio there is horrible never seen so many people quit the 3 years I was there. People quit because of this favoritism as did I, there was days I would work 14 hours a day and then you may work fridays as well. Shedule is sun - thursday & you have to work a friday every month sometimes twice. Supervisors dont step in when you get harrased by your co workers!!"
bad,Worked there for 6 months you don’t join the union until 20 weeks but u still have to pay union dues even though you are not given any benefit until your 20 weeks is up they are a numbers based company meaning if you don’t hit 100 percent on a weekly bases they can pretty much fire you if your not in the union there is 0 room for Growth as a warehouse employee Hr doesn’t care about you neither does management they hire anyone background checks don’t mean much to this place there people that work there that are felons they hire anyone I would say they do give out turkeys and hams for the holidays and benefits are good once you make union but I would never recommend anyone to work here. And they could never get past 15 days safe someone is always getting injured.
bad,"Management has no ones back but their own. The hourly employee does all the work but the manager gets all the credits, trips and nbonuses. The employee get not even a thank you and its a billion dollar company and you might get an 2% raise or nothing at all."
bad,"I was a delivery associate out of Victoria for 5 years. Had lots of great customers and the pay cheque never bounced."
bad,"met nic people had to create a market of my own. learning a new state took some time but all was good. Good clients, alot of choices. Training was good"
bad,"This place doesn't care about the load the drivers leave out with each morning. They have one goal and that is to get it on the trailer as fast as possible and let the driver deal with it once he gets out there. Sometimes trying to get the right product to the right stop is like playing a game of where's waldo. When you address the supervisor with concerns  about your route they could care less. Also you have a camera on you the whole time you are driving. If you brake to hard the supervisors are all over you, but addressing your  load is something they don't want to hear about. This was the worst job I have had in my life. I am still in the food service and have been doing it for 20 years. Sysco by far is the worst place to work for."
bad,The Average Salary is not taking into account out of pocket expenses. Expect to have over 10k a year in unreimbursed expenses. I barely netted 20k for the year after working 60+ hours every week. No time off at all. Only 3 paid holidays off. No work life balance.
bad,Typical day would be 850 cases and 14 to 16 stops per day with no help. Routing would route u over 14 hours per day with different stops everyday. Not enough trucks and equipment..
bad,"Initially this company was a premium job for warehousing, but as the years went by more responsibilities were added while your income shrank.  Great atmosphere with co workers"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"The company and the job itself is good and pay/benefits are great but management could careless about the employees.  Turnover is atrocious and drivers are treated very poorly. Management does not listen to recommendations or your needs, they don't follow up on issues you bring to their attention, and most of all do not hold anyone accountable for their action's so people do whatever they want. Until these things along with the favoritism changes this at this location it will be a mediocre company. They have failed to adapt to todays workforce thus the high turnover. You cant just throw money at people anymore and treat them poorly, they need and expect more."
bad,"overall i think sysco is a good company.  they are the biggest mainline food service distribution company and for some reason the most expensive.  i didnt feel like we purchased correctly and put too much equity on items."
bad,I was hired by a DSM and he was fired before I started. Went through weeks and weeks of training with no manager to report to and when the new DMS was hired with no experience he was unable to help be be successful nor did he try.
bad,High Pressure sales. Clear expectations. Good incentives for performance. Great structure. They push their sales force to know as much as possible about products.
bad,I started working for Sysco right after obtaining my CDL license and obtained a lot of useful experience. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for experience in driving or delivery.
bad,"Sysco is a great place to work if you are capable of sustaining the long hours required.  "
bad,The management did not work together with employees to benefit the production of the delivery process to customers.  They did not treat employees with respect of how hard we worked for the company.
bad,"very long work days."
bad,"the company used to be a family environment with a family, God, company philosophy"
bad,"Corporate management is clueless as to local company business.  Local upper management are unprofessional with lots of favoritism, work place harassment and bullying.  HR will favor management over workers."
bad,The company is very much just processing a cog in the system.  There is not a huge amount of support and extremely micro managed.  In general not a place I would recommend.
bad,great pay management is ok when things are going their way if you are looking for a employer who typically cares about the employees sysco is not the place if you are a family oriented person night shift is not the place their employee turn around ratio is 90% sad to say to sysco is not a good job unless you are single with nothing on your mind but work
bad,"Management is very different in warehouse than it is in the offices."
bad,"middle age drama from the management team, this is not a young persons place - too stuffy and not for the older crowd - no one lasts long enough to retire."
bad,"This company they didn't keep these promised they said after 3 months probation i'm going to be come full time with benefit"
bad,"Hours are long, the average worker has been in the job so long they are not very progressive. Not very open to new and progressive ideas. The new President of Metro is progressive, this is their only hope."
bad,"bad equipment do not keep insides of trackers clean, office skills in transportation are poor could use some people skills on how to talk to employees,"
bad,"As long as you are willing to put your heart and soul into this position, you will succeed.  It demands alot of your time and you MUST have thick skin or customers will eat you alive."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Not flexible "
bad,Had its moments but really unfair company.. Pay is the only positive.. you have some selectors putting in certain batches.. heavily understaffed your forced to load every night and the seniority is a joke. HR is friends with certain selectors so some people have it way easier than other. I wouldn't recommend this job honestly more stress than there worth.. you have lazy coworkers in dry who don't really want to work until freezer & cooler selectors help them.. they have people in positions that aren't even qualified for the position.. it's a job but yet a high school environment. Never seen so many grown men tell on each other.. look else where terrible job I promise you
bad,This is ridiculous Indeed. I am just going to type a random sentence here because this is a complete waste of time. No work/life balance and they will betray you.
bad,"Does not pay well, but expects a lot of hours put in. Benefits are pretty bad, commute is great (Cypress location). Overall, the commute and casual dress code are not worth the poor pay, benefits and work/life balance. Plus, they are constantly making changes in their processes/procedures, and moving their employees into different roles. Lots of meetings but nothing gets done."
bad,"Very badly managed company. Workload does not coincide with time frame needed. "
bad,Not the greatest place.  You are typically just a number and can be easily replaced.  Extremely competitive. Top down management style.
bad,"Sysco needs to replace the management team.Either there lazy and dont want to work.Or there rude and do not know how to treat you as a employee..From the human resource department to management,they are very unprofessional.I have never work for a company that was so unorganized .They do not value or have respect for the employees.They are neither concerned with employees needs or there wants.They all about self.Its I team,not a us team..They are all about self.The management attitude,is very disrespectful and leave a bad taste in your mouth."
bad,"Looks good on a resume.  Beyond that, hold on tight because working here is a grind.  Over managed and under compensated is how I would describe jobs here.  The food is awesome though!"
bad,"A Great place to work and advance based on your job performance until Corporate Management took over. One used to be evaluated based on sales, years of service, and account retention."
bad,"If you want no life balance, no family time, ad no more hair on your head, then go work for Sysco!"
bad,"Huge corporation that has majority of the market share, many great people within the company.  Upper management is extremely involved in daily sales goal and makes decisions on short term plan not long term."
bad,"This place was ok to work for sometime but, a bunch of hypocrites have taken over on management. The only thing they know what to do is write people up for stupid stuff. The warehouse management is up there with this transportation management clowns. All they give a flip about is numbers for corporate. The loads are all lopsided, unstraped, to the trailers last and middle stops mixed in with first stops. Sometimes stops 4-8 in front of stops 1-3. All the way to the back door violating OSHA'S requirements of at least minimum 18 inches of work space. They don't give you sufficient time to deliver at big stops, where your walking a far distance plus with elevators. Without proper equipment 97% of the time they don't provide liftgates when needed. Nor electric jacks it's a mess with management yes the pay is good, but not safe. And they will work every hour out of you in the week forcing you to work on your days off etc.. Well good luck to you and, please don't take me for granted. Because your going to find out the hard way look at their turnover ratio that should say enough."
bad,"Things have changed a lot since I started here.  I was one of the original 50 people to get the place up and running.  Culture, management, hours, activities have all changed.  Many of the original people left because of poor management.  I left for a career advancement at corporate office."
bad,My typical day at work would a full day schedule because I do not like sitting around doing nothing. A day at work should be productive. There are time to play and there are time to get thing done.
bad,Need to work long hours in order to be successful in this business. Many hours spent in your own car logging countless miles all on your own dime.
bad,"Sysco employees used to be proud of how long they've worked for the company.  Now they seem to be counting the days until they leave.  Corporate has been taking more and more control over the individual OpCos and upper management transfers in for other markets and starts cleaning house before they have any knowledge of the unit's culture or operations.  No one feels secure in there job and even performing sales people aren't safe."
bad,"Sysco Iowa is located in Ankeny, Iowa, but my district team is located from the northwest portion of the state to the northeast portion of the state.  This presented a plethora of challenges, and we experienced high turnover in the position of our district manager. This made it very difficult to receive support from upper management at the office, located 3.5 hours away."
bad,"Once a great company to work for.  Poor management has affected pay cuts, job cuts, outsourcing.  Always changing ways to make less money and commission.  Have worked here a long time and making less money then ever before.  No compensation for gas, car care or cell phones.  Basically work 7 days a week and all hours of the day, night and weekends.  No family life."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"Very large work load and an emense amount of responsibilty placed on certain employees (depending on the position), which was fine, however, there was very little administrative support made available making it very difficult to focus on, an implement, the main goals of the position - sales growth. Also, depending on the department, very poor management support which made the job extremely difficult to succeed in."
bad,"Management is clueless and is not clear who is running the company. Their practices are outdated, they do not promote from within and their is"
bad,I gave 10 years to this company and got very little back. I applied for advancement and was passed over by employees from companies we aquired. Management has no loyalty to its sales force at all.
bad,"a typical day in the warehouse floor,is always in a hurry and trying to reach a certain percentage or piece counts just to get a performance bonus $$$, but when they hire temporary foreign worker, they make it a must that your should a certain very high performance (95%) or else you'll be re-trained, suspended or terminated. maybe this is the very reason only temporary foreign worker mostly endure the job here to earn money to be sent home to their love ones. Many time we do not take full breaks or lunch just to continue the job and have high performance."
bad,Sysco offers great pay and benefit but they demand a lot. Work/life balance is almost none existant. Opportunities for advancement are only available if you are willing to relocate. They most offer opportunities to candidates from outside the company
bad,There are a lot of great people working here.  There is also a poor management system where they don't follow the corporate mission.  A typical large corporation looking to squeeze more out of you and give you less.
bad,"Management preaches that Sysco is Best Food Company to work for, if they are, the food industry is Not the place to work to make a decent living.  Compensation plan had unattainable bonus and if you do not make bonus your paycheck is a joke."
bad,"It's an ok place to work. "
bad,Always struggling to find equipment (handtrucks) needed to work because no one was assigned to it but everyone either locked it or took it with them at end of shift. Each Pallet where mixed with 4 to 10 stops which was very time consuming. Everything is seniority based so don’t expect to get a good route on the first 10 years and most of those routes are downtown area. Average stops per day was about 14.
bad,It's a hard job and not for everyone but you got to want it to work here and lose family life because they will work you hard I feel the money is not that great due to the work you do and management is not doing there job
bad,Unbalanced work load. Inconsistency with work load and stops. Not constant stops or tractors. Different daily. To many chiefs that you have to report to.
bad,"They do pay for your workload but it sure doesn’t feel like it. Very poor work/life balance. Great if you want to work yourself to death and have a broken down body in ten years. Some can handle it, my body couldn’t anymore. 18 years in and I got forced out because of mobility issues."
bad,"Constant Pressure from all directions. It is a good place to learn and excel at the same. I am a smart person, Sysco challenges you to get better everyday. Our Motto at Sysco was and still is ""Continuous improvement""."
bad,Best part of the job was pay day. Culture was very Cut throat. Hardest part of the job was trying to rest up for the next day. Management were all flunkies no morals no principles. Only Goal was to over work the drivers. Enjoyable part was getting off for 34 hours.
bad,"Company has great benefits, they match 6% 401k and 15% off stock purchase. Management is awful, constant back and forth changes in the company. Every district has one or two sales reps with a good territory and are there for a long time (they are part of the company). The other 5 or 6 sales reps are there for one or two years then quit or are fired because of the awful territories they're assigned. It's extremely hard to grow your territory, Sysco is usually known to be more expensive than the competition. You will drive 300 to 400 miles a week visiting  your accounts and prospects and will not get paid milage. Weekly + monthly in person sales meetings 5+ hours long, one hour is productive material and information the other 4 or 5 hours are useless. It's obvious what changes need to made but company refuses to listen."
bad,"The work environment is very stressful. My particular job is a central component to the whole of the company which puts quite a bit of pressure on us. Given the context, It is very rare that we get any praise for a job well done considering how much we have to juggle on a daily basis. My department is poorly managed and does not have the discipline to carry out day to day activities let alone the goals for the future of the department. "
bad,"Management only cares about themselves with no regard to the regular worker.  Its all about pushing employees to the edge with no rewards to the workers, no bonuses, no incentives, come on Sysco actions speak louder than words.  They say they run legal but they honestly push their drivers who fear job loss, management only cares about themselves, supervisors run a warehouse by screaming at you, Worse company ever"
bad,"First, we need to follow the instruction of the quality control before entering in the warehouse and all employers need to proceed correctly without risk of contaminate the production room."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"The pay is decent for the work you do. It sucks putting up with the truckers. It starts to catch up to you, on your stress levels, and physical body. I’m glad I threw in the towel a second time, in under a year."
bad,"Great pay, great benifits. But once you hurt your back they get rid of u. Cutthroat. I would of stayed. I didn't mind that the job was super hard. But soon as I hurt my back they got rid of me. Would never want anyone to go through that. You will have permanent back problems. Not worth any kind of money. They get u bye throwing money at u so you work harder an carelessly so u make the numbers."
bad,"Take orders"
bad,I would not ever recommend working for Sysco Corperation.  I was a driver there for three years.  Every aspect of the job was horrible with the exception of the pay
bad,Horrible communication not geared towards customers only geared towards numbers. Great union truck drivers and some supervisors overworked and under paid.
bad,its an okay place to work at but i have a family that's growing and i have been here almost going on 5 years and have not seen no advancement tours my position. i have seen other people that's been here a shorter time then me with the same education level moving up and its come to the point that this job is not making any sense for me anymore. like any father would love to give your family the world and update in life i cant working here.
bad,Very difficult place to work for a sales person.  Commission only and  you must meet a minimum order to be able to be paid your commission.  Also responsible for collections and Sysco will cut your customer off without a second thought.
bad,"Its literally impossible to do the thngs management wants in 8 hrs. They discourage ot for this position. You are responsible for temping cooler items, you have to check in and return, cooler, freezer and dry while weaving through the order selectors. It seems that every week they try to add a new task on you. Pay is 15 an hour but after insurance, its more like 12. There is only one other person working this position so if they call in sick, you will be expected to fill their shift which means youll be coming in at 9 or 10 am instead of your scheduled, 1 2 or 3 pm. Management needs alot of help because they have no direction. Its a good job if youre single and have no kids. This modesto faciility is always hiring because theyre always firing. I was let go for too much overtime"
bad,"You will need to give them your life to work for this company.  If you are a single person with no responsibilities, it may work for you but it requires 70 hours a week if you want to make any money.  It takes 5 to 10 years to make a decent living.  If you have that kind of time, it may work for you."
bad,Decrease salaries poor supervision on making decisions on problems. Very unsafe stops management listen but want make changes
bad,"I learned the administration and supervision of the materials used for building model houses."
bad,"Typical day includes up at 1:30am with a mim 10 hr work day.average14 to 16 every work day.I learned DOT rules and health department rules were not the# 1 priority.I have no comment on management,due to lack of being approachable.My coworkers were some of the best iv'e ever worked with.drivers relied on each other.The hardest part of the job was the reverse stacking of product that worked against the routing.The best part of my job was our customers,every delivery was a good delivery."
bad,"to many hours. not for the person with a family. management is no good. they will promise you the world to get you in, then when you start you get none which was promised"
bad,"I work at the Harrisonburg warehouse,this place is without a doubt the worst managed place I have ever worked.tTo become a manager just learn how to say YES to everything upper management has to say, our management team were truck drivers,they are consistently cutting pay and finding ways to terminate employees and do it with a smile,there are good and friendly people here but are leaving daily.you can ask a question and are passed around and around until someone finally comes up with an answer.I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS SYSCO AS A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.If you don't need pay raises and love cuts this is the place for you."
bad,"I worked at Sysco for almost a year and during the time found the Office culture to be very good, however, the upper management at Sysco Corporate for IT is out of tune with their employees. While the benefits and compensation is good, the work life balance is horrible and when you start in a job there, you are setup for failure. Adding to that, I was also cheated out of one week's pay by Sysco."
bad,This job is definitely not for the first time order selector. Very demanding and fast pace. Employees get no time to be trained generally. Production is time and cases per hour based. Good luck!
bad,"A typical day at Sysco is long at least 10 hrs usually 12 or more.  Its a fast paced race track where everyone is racing for their life or should I say job.  A lot of lifting, bending, stooping, and reaching. The co workers were friendly but not much time to know them because everyone is always on the move.  Hardest part was trying to make your time in the warehouse the pay was the best thing about the job."
bad,"Driving was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Faced pace work environment that could be a fun and wonderful job. If your looking to make good money and not have a life with your family then this is a job for you.
bad,"Salary is good but the constant pressure to perform and sell is immense. Also a lot of unnecessary computer work for a salesman"
bad,was like a family environment.  every day was a learning day.  management was great and co-workers were top notch.  worse part of the job was the hours.  and the best part was helping associates succeed and move to the next level.
bad,Good company but upper management seems to be disconnected.
bad,sysco is a great company work for. great advancement in the company.
bad,Just like any other order selecting company but pays better. Only down fall is the production standers is wayyyy to high. I done this type of work for other company before so I know what I am doing. I seen my coworkers skipping breaks and lunches to be at company standard. In less than 3 months over 10 injuries from experience workers with shoulder and back. Its ridicules to see a company where it long time employees struggle to be at standard. LONG HOURS and after probational period you will work 6 days a week 10 - 12 hrs a day. Also the Whole management team has less than 3 years exp so most of them are clueless to the pace the work has to be done.
bad,Worked with some great customers. Liked being a partner with them and help them with their growth.
bad,"Very heavy workload."
bad,"Under trained employees are expected to meet extremely tough requirements without proper training, in addition to the fact that employee feedback is not headed nor cared about. But hey, they pay well."
bad,"Early mornings, family oriented, but being a corporate environment most of employees are very non-chalant with their work ethic. very non-chalant with paying process."
bad,"No chance for advancement, unless you are part of the (click). Management very unprofessional and very underhanded. Department Managers have little or no knowledge necessary in their positions. long physical and thank less hours everyday. No support from Operations but constant harassment wanting to know why you can't meet you delivery windows, management is extremely lazy."
bad,"I pretty straight forward job, not difficult to learn. However, if you can't work hard and work through your breaks and 1/2 your lunch you wont make it. "
bad,"Poor management, favoritism, little regard for customers or low end employees. Only concern seems to be about efficiency(numbers) & not the safety/ well being of the worker. Inadequate training with regard to operating systems. Unable to approach managers with safety concerns or job related issues. Unreasonable expectations in regard to work performance or ability. Unable to understand I.T. personnel who seem to lack the ability to speak the English language & offer little help/support. Warehouse too small to accommodate pallet jacks. Some aisles too narrow for safe fork lift operation. Cracks in warehouse floor & leaky roof are hazards for pedestrians, pallet jack & fork operators. If you're looking for stable, long term employment with little or no stress, then this is not the place for you!"
bad,"Great flexibility in schedule, not enough new business avialable to advance salary and career"
bad,"Productive places to work at, but not much room for advancement without seniority."
bad,Drivers under pressure to get out in 30 minutes. Trucks are overloaded can’t get equipment inside truck.Equipment is old and not maintained well. Coworkers are very helpful and supportive. It’s all about the numbers but the numbers always don’t tell the whole story.
bad,"Working at Sysco requires one to terminate their personal life and enter into a world of darkness. Ok, that's a little much, but starting at midnight and working until approximately 2pm leaves little time for anything else in life. Although many hours and overtime are offered, living in California, the more you make, the more they take. Topped by forced union dues you are looking to only get about 2/3 of your paycheck."
bad,"500-1100 cases on a truck. 8-18 stops. Have delivery windows impossible to adhere to. Not uncommon to run 2hrs behind everyday. As a newbie youll run overflow till u get your own route. Alot of long 10-14 hr days in texas heat RUNNING to make time. Digging thru pallets is the worst. Nonsensical and time consuming. A long time sysco vet told me  ""the work is terrible and it will ALWAYS be terrible. If u can get past that youll be alright"". Pay seems great at first but considering the toll it takes on your body it doesnt seem worth it overtime."
bad,"I worked as a loader/order selector and it was ok for a while but when I moved to loading they expected me to have a high percentage as far as speed goes when I was loading the trucks. One thing they didn't understand was the order selectors sometimes don't stack the cases right and I had a hard time loading the trucks and it made my time slower than it should be, basically its cutthroat and only for young guys."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,I was the daytimes receiver I would unload trucks sometimes using triple pallet jacks and forklift then I would have to identify make sure it was the right product and not damaged then check quantity and do paperwork
bad,Very competitive and hard on the body. The equipment is poor but works. Good pay for young legs. Heavy lifting 50 to 75lbs.They were honest in asking.
bad,"When I started at Sysco in 2008, it was a great place to work. but the last couple of years, the corporate office took more control at our OpCo, and work became very stressful."
bad,It's all about the $ with Sysco. They have great pay and benefits but they dont care at all about their drivers. They're  just 2 legged miles in the companies eyes
bad,U have to use ramp that trailer has to offload the stuff and u bave to roll it to the store by cart a lot of physical work and stress. Menagement is wors same as dispach people they dont care about u they care how many skids they can fit in the trailer and mostly u end up with no safety zone that u can start ur work
bad,Most cutthroat place I've ever worked management is the worst I've ever seen all they are concerned with is making their bonuses the pay is great but not worth the BS you have to put up with the micro managing is way over the top BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!!!!
bad,"Current employee, been with the company for 6months. I like a physical driving job because it keeps you in shape but this company will push you to your limit daily. The workload is overwhelming!! They can’t keep help because they work the employees they do have to death. They expect you to do your job correctly while overloading you to the point that you barely have time get your stops off. The routes are very inconsistent and change about the time you start to learn them. The trailers are loaded like garbage everyday so you spend a lot of time digging for product. The management is decent but they talk down to you as if you don’t realize that what they are telling you is a line of bs. They just say whatever needed to get you off the phone when you call for help or with a concern. Pay is decent but should really be a little more for the workload. Benefits are good."
bad,"This job was extremely difficult and stress-inducing.  Sysco is a fast-paced company however because of the nature of produce and food, the nature of this position requires a high level of pressure and you are on the hot seat all day, everyday."
bad,President brings his own people in and they are not qualified. The company and moral is at a all time low. I hope the new EVP takes over. They current president blames everyone and knows nothing other than cherry’s and core lettuce.
bad,You will only work nights because it's all by seniority. Almost every night will be 10 hours. It's a Union job and management is anti Union. There is a definite management against employee atmosphere in the warehouse. Warehouse and drivers are excluded from office Christmas and other parties.
bad,"My experience is awful because of the poor leadership and extremely demanding schedule.  Work/Life balance is unheard of.  Worked all holidays but Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.  Leaders are not trained on today's business climate and love the ""way we always do it"" attitude."
bad,"I learned a lot as my first sales job. Training program was very well run and organized. Very good product line. Had to learn how to play the game. Management had there favorites. Learned how to take care of customers, cold call and prospect."
bad,If you interested in making decent money with benefits Sysco is ok. They demand a lot of your time and don't care about family time. You have to debate with management just to use your earned PTO. They have poor equipment and don't mind sending drivers
bad,"This company has solid pay and benefits if you were working 40 hours a week. Because you are salaried, you never get any time off because you are always on call with the clients. Very stressful to know that even though it's the weekend, you can get the call or text at anytime and have to deal with more client problems like late trucks, order problems. The company should really invest in a weekend staff to handle that but they didn't!"
bad,If you like working your a@# off then this is the place for you keep your mouth shut do your work and you will do great dont call off even if you have time if you  use the union that you pay dues for watch out they dont like that they will find someway to get rid of you
bad,I loved the work itself and dealing with most of the salesmen but the offices are full of drama and if you are on the wrong side of one of the people who can do no wrong they will work for years to try and fire you.
bad,Union division.  Management is very bad.  Don't care fort employees or customers.  Only concern is bottom line.  Very political.  Very departmentalized with everyone trying to blame others for problems that arise.
bad,Good people to work with but management doesn't treat everyone equally. Different deals for employees who have the same job title.
bad,"good for the money to work for but you gonna work the whole day deliviring to restaurant, hospital, hotel and etc. the best part you enjoying about this job is dealing with costumer"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"The environment wasn't the best but it was doable. Like I said you'll received mandatory overtime, which is a plus. But you'll twist, stand, bend, for 8-12hrs."
bad,"There has been a mass turnover the last few years. They have gone through to VP's of operations, 2 directors of transportation, and multiple operstions supervisors."
bad,A potentially great place to work with good pay. But not for those who take pride in what they do. Management across the board lacks conviction and common sense.
bad,"Very high pressure employment.  Big company, very little consideration of the small business owner.  Very corporate driven, hels accountable to shareholders."
bad,"Looking for something closer to Evergreen CO relocating, Category Planning is a high stress high anxiety position, management holds planners completely accountable for numbers and their own success as individuals."
bad,"*Typical night- Selecting product from dry/cooler warehouse, operate pallet jack, stack product on pallets, drop off pallets in loading dock."
bad,"A closed communication & non supportive environment"
bad,My typical day in Sysco Devt Corp was an early meeting with sales staff. Give instructions. Discuss the closeable accounts and how do we do about them to be able to close them soon as possible.
bad,6pm to 3 or 4am
bad,"I enjoyed the Job I was supposed to do, Logistics, so much so that our first Period of this Fiscal Year was at an all-time high, LEI was up 37%. However, as with many companies, they are so focused on head count and numbers they are overloading employees with other responsibilities to the point their main job functions cannot be fulfilled as it should. The position I was in had to report to corporate headquarters in TX and also to the local Sysco House but neither one knew what the other was asking of the employee. I learned a lot while I worked there and most was an invaluable experience. I will truly miss calling it home, especially after nearly 23 years. I am deeply passionate about my work, i'm a very ethical person, but it just came to a point that I could no longer face coming in to work knowing before getting there that I could not get to all the job tasks waiting for me so I felt compelled to give my 2 weeks notice, even without having another job lined up. A lot of good, caring, dedicated and loyal people are leaving. More changes are coming, it always gets worse before it gets better."
bad,Working with customers everyday is the best part of the job.  Really no vacation time as you have to find coverage and it is hard to do.  For sure a fifty to sixty hour a week job.
bad,"Management did not allow me into warehouse and check product, then accuse me of not buying fresh product when warehouse does not rotate it."
bad,"So far in my experience, there is always a lack of functioning equipment. Wether it be e-logs, scanners, tractors, trailers, pallet jacks, ramps, two wheelers. New router is not good, I have nothing positive to say about him, management seems to not mind so I assume it is acceptable practice. He makes it a miserable job. The way the trucks are loaded via the warehouse are either manageable, or atrocious."
bad,The job is not terribly difficult but it is very stressful and current management does not seem to care. But pay and benefits are very good. There just isn't enough off time to rest between shifts.
bad,"Typical day if entering invoices for three different opcos."
bad,Company not ready for such changes.  Keep pushing but not ready.  No common sense. Not able to sample properly.  Sysco has raised all the sales cost so they can make their numbers.
bad,"Sysco does not care about there employee's when it come to driving in snow or ice. "
bad,"I have done every job at Sysco outside any office position. You can make a good money here if you want to work 60 hours a week and do permanent damage you your body in the process. Very hard job physically and is definitely not for everyone or anyone who wants long time employment. Management does care about you or your safety, all they care about is if the customer gets their product, all else is trivial to them."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,"12 years at Sysco and they promote from within who they want to promote. The people in charge of the transportation department are not qualified to do the job. They were selected by a higher up that liked them. Guys are promoted more on the buddy buddy system vs actual qualifications. Huge lack of communication between departments. Drivers are always the last to know what is going on, trucks are loaded poorly. You will touch the same box 8 times before you deliver it. The pay is good but you are underpaid for the actual work you do. There are better jobs out there that pay less and have a better work life balance and are easier on the body"
bad,great pay at loss for life outside of work. over worked at fast pace with expected high performance with high injury job duties error are able validate and new employee have longest wait to climb the ladder with this company better for young single ppl. not many African american employee
bad,"They tell you when you walk in the door that the job is not for everyone. It was frustrating to be working hard and not making my quota. Then I'm easily working 10hr days, 6 days/wk. It was like swimming upstream. For a younger guy driven to make it his career, go for it. I'm not interested in stressing over hitting my numbers and skipping my first break trying to do it. They sell you a line because honestly they're desperate for people, so of course they sweeten the pot, but it's a whole lot of disillusion that occurs for some a few months in."
bad,most of the time you are just trying to keep up. Most of the managers are not very knowledgeable on how to manage their employees. This is a union shop their so no advancement unless some one leaves
bad,"Long hours. A lot of drive time. Company didn't cover any expenses."
bad,I was a shuttle driver and I got really sick and was only to work 8 hour days not 12 the let me go i also needed the ins they could care less now i work for the city so sysco did me a favor.
bad,"I work 10-16 hours a day 6 days a week. I am forced in on my days off to work. I have had a back injury since working here. I am supposed to be on ""Light duty"" but yet I am still subjected to harsh grueling work that is tearing my body apart. Hardly get any time or days off with my family, the money is good but hardly any time to enjoy it. Great benefit, but this company doesn't care about your body whatsoever. They will work you 70hrs straight, HARD WORK and wont let you have YOUR day off!! If you dont work 6hrs on your day off after putting in 60+ hrs in 5 days, they will WRITE YOU UP and even fire you.. Think that's fair? I dont"
bad,"Was able to learn a lot about the food industry, and was able to work in different departments to learn the business inside and out. Loved the people the environment and all the different jobs I had there. The management often times did not communicate responsibilities very well."
bad,"Worked with some great people, surely would work there again.  Good management team, but I would suggest they work on their culture diversity. Really enjoyed working for this company."
bad,Sysco lures you in with fake promises.  The workload is excessive and the compensation is minimum for such a large billion dollar company.  Do not expect good things from Sysco.
bad,"Sysco will run you into the ground. At night you will get a call from the dispatcher between 8-9 p.m to find out your start time the next day. Most time they would want you in at 2-3 a.m so off the bat your running on low sleep. Clock in pick your route if your on the extra board and go out the door to get your tractor and hook up your trailer. Most routes average 10-16 stops and 550-1000 cases. Routes can average 10-15 hours. Got 3 zones of pallets dry, cooler, and freezer. Pallets will have 2-5 stops on each pallet so you will be breaking pallets down and organizating all day long!!!! Loads are always jacked up, falling over, and breakage galore. This job will work you all day everyday if they need you except sundays. Work all holidays except thanksgiving and christmas. Think hard before you apply here, if its worth the money and benafits and your willing go ahead, but of you have a family you like spending time with STAY AWAY! They dont care about your family, they want you in that truck when they need you and no excuses! Glad I left one of the worse jobs I had!"
bad,great pay and thats about it. job sucks. typical day starts at 4 and ends around 4. back breaking but like i said money is good and this a great place for those who need money.
bad,"Fremont, CA location has apparently gone through many changes in the past year.  Upper management seems disconnected and just looking to fill holes.  Workers given very little training before being sent off on their own.  Very negative opinion of workers by management."
bad,"If you want to know what it feels like to be a modern day slave, then join Sysco as a order Selector. This is my third week and my supervisor is expecting me to run at 70% or higher everyday. I work 12 to 15 hours daily with no time to really recuperate from the previous day of work.  Every muscle on my body aches literally.  Hourly reminders that if u don't select at the rate they want, u will be let go. I can honestly say the only thing keeping me going is the money, but even that is not worth it. Be prepared to ravage your body!"
bad,"Listen what the employees are saying....stop all the surveys and start reading them!!!! Do not show Elmo singing about 5's so you  think that will influence people to choose 5,  do you really think your employees are that stupid."
bad,After your face to face orders you will spend the rest of the day prospecting. This is a commission based job so if you don't sell you don't eat.
bad,The biggest problem with Sysco is the way the people in the wearhouse loaded the trailer The Warehouse help was paid by the pice and not by the hour So they did not care about how the trailer was loaded You would have fifteen stops on a trailer and on every pallet you’re first stop would be on the bottom of each pallet so you would have to tear down each pallet to get to what you needed
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,You work 12 hours 5 days a week and you come home and sleep and go back to work you don’t have time for family during the week or even anything you want to do for that matter. The pay is really good but it depends what you want more in life money or family
bad,Great pay laboring work extremely fast paced 12 to 14 hour days high turnover rate paid weekly management improved and are doing great job. If you like working like a machine this if for you
bad,"I was recently laid off from the company due to down sizing. I started in May and was told in November that I would be provided a severance package that started in March. Half way through February I was advised that their was a lack of communication and even though they said in November I would be paid (6) weeks severance and (2) weeks of vacation, I would actually be receiving none of that. We were not able to use any time starting in January to look for other jobs (i.e. go to interviews) so with (2) weeks left until the job is complete,  I have been left high and dry with only being provided a ""we are sorry""."
bad,"Lets just say I strongly recommend looking in another direction for a positive career. This job does provide good health benefits and a pension if you can make it..Your day starts very early AM! You have to Scan all the stickers on the truck and trailer, load a hand cart , do all your paperwork and be out of hub site within 15 mins. Then upon arriving at your first stop, good luck finding all the product . You have to dig , dig, dig cause all pallets are mixed up. The load isn't made to be delivered by each stop, you have to break down and touch every case on the truck. Seperating the product for each stop as you go thru your miserable day. The average route has about 700+ cases and when you first start out, good luck trying to separate cooler, dry and frozen products. Another fun part is digging all the freezer product out of the freezer side door, while standing on the pull out side stairs. then going up and down these steps to load your hand cart multiple times. Then you go to the back of the trailer, pull out the 20 ft steel ramp. Which you will be running up and down all day long, which eventually will ruin your knees. Cause if you want to finish the super long day, you best load the hand cart up. Then you may get done in about 12 hrs, you can only hope. Now you have to run your Butt off, cause you got to pull, push, that hand cart up stairs, down stairs and it just really sucks! Then in every truck theres in cab cameras, which record your every move. If your caught touching any electronic device phone, gps, or whatever. They will Fire you. don't think the union will help"
bad,"Will run and work you to death,  1 day off per week, communting to Lincoln from Omaha and then running a 14 clock. Management very cut throat and will throw you under the bus any chance they get."
bad,Communication within the department  is horrible.  The group as a whole doesn't work cohesively together.  Upper manager disregards lower management and never communicates the vision to Team Leads.
bad,"This place is great to make alot of money, but it does come at a price, you'll be working a lot of hours, and definitely a physically demanding job, it's something to definitely be prepared for, if your willing to sacrifice your time to spend with family and etc then be my guest, might as well live at work. Also managers don't really train there employees correctly too, they leave out a lot of stuff your supposed to be prepared for in the future,  they just train you only 1 to 2 days and your basically on your own from there on out."
bad,"to much to do and never enough time to do it in but management continues to keep adding more on to our plates with out getting more help, it is  overwhelming!"
bad,working 60 to 70 per week and u might get one day maybe one day and half and u resting on your day off to get back and do it again
bad,"Was blessed to have the opportunity to experience several positions at Sysco. When I began my journey Sysco was the type of company one could grow with. Now it lacks job security for any position there. The more money you earn the more at risk you become for your services no longer required. Regardless of your knowledge or years of service. It's unfortunate that the company decided to downsize staff with many years of service and knowledge just so they could rehire other people at a lower wage. So now many positions are based at a lower wage that certainly does not match the work volume and expectations. Some positions that use to be full time are now classified as part time.  The company decides to focus on numbers than employees. On paper they look great and cover all the required basis, but struggle to practice what they preach. If you love to be micromanaged this is the company for you. This is a fast paced environment that struggles to maintain teamwork among departments. They say one thing and do the complete opposite. Sink or swim"
bad,Company is run poorly by Young Supervisers who don^t know what they are doing. There is nothing hard about working in a warehouse to me. My coworkers were good to work with .
bad,Sysco is a large corporation and sales driven.
bad,Failed to provide full disclosure of position requirements during the interview process. Did not follow through on agreed territory after hire. I am not compensated as well as projected during the interview process.
bad,"Est. 68k a year 1st year NOT 82k "
bad,"Sysco has a fast paced work environment but offers inconvenient work life balance. Workplace advancement is based around the union, making it very difficult for newer employee (under 5 years of employment) to advance at all."
bad,"Management of the Warehouse has lowered the wages of Warehouse employees, increased production, fired those who attempted to Unionize and have kept all the money for themselves. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to come here under current conditions."
bad,Sysco is a good company.  They will work you without mercy as a driver.  Prepare to work 60 to 70 hrs a week.  The loading of the trailers is terrible.  You will spend A LOT of time digging for cases.  When you are finally done with a route you have to call and hope they do not send you somewhere else.  That is ridiculous.  When I empty the trailer and worked 12 hours it's time to go home.  They will call you relentlessly like they own you.  Navigation in the trucks does not work!!! You have to use your own but you are not allowed to touch any device while in the truck.  How else are new guys supposed to find out where they are going??  They hire but look for ways to fire. The union....I'm just not a fan.  Good company but too many rules to keep track of.
bad,Good 401K up to 6% participation match.  Healthcare benefits are through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois with a number of plan options.  Also stock options are competitive.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,A typical Day starts with a huddle of the teams to discuss any updates of job duties and the company.  Opening Emails to view and verify any callbacks to customers for urgency. Follow up on daily phone calls and etc
bad,I enjoyed working for sysco. Being able to be apart of something. The work was hard but it helped me gain a good work experience and ethic. I learned new things and got good at what I was doing
bad,No job security.  Ware house always running behind.. they write you up for everything little thing. You'll be working very long hours but you'll will make good money
bad,"Company as a whole is not bad, internal bickering and nitpicking amongst upper level management does not bode well for warm fuzzy feeling and feeling of belonging in general personnel."
bad,"terrible night shift. team moral is usually pretty low.management requires you to pick the same amount of pieces each night. If youre having a slower night, they,ll assign you picks to bring your piece count up."
bad,Not a bad place to work.  10 weeks to get production for ppl that haven't done this work before is a little rough but only downfall is they write you up for any and everything.
bad,"A typical day at work can vary during the summer , when in season things get very crazy .Mangement doesn't respect their employees."
bad,The most challenging part of the job is the need to drive efficiency while the historic culture of autonomy to the individual business units.  Drive for this efficiency will be difficult to realize.
bad,"They work there drivers extremly long hours and push the dot logs to the limit. They treat drivers bad, and insurance takes 10 months to get. So beware"
bad,Cablaggi quadri elettrici generali per ferrovie dello stato in piu montaggio e cablatura monitor a led di segnalazioni
bad,"Consumes way to much of your time for little pay.  Not the same job it was 10 years ago.  The industry has become commoditised.  Lots of micromanaging, cronyism, backwards thinking."
bad,Great company to work for but Very demanding job at times.  You're home everyday and that beats being over the road.
bad,The job was ok but too much turnover of Marketing Assistants.
bad,"Very busy usually, lots of phone work, hardest part of my job is telling my accounts no, the best part is talking to all of my accounts."
bad,Best part of the job is the customers.  Worst part is company direction.
bad,supervisors made things easy long hrs being new usually on call
bad,Well a normal day was me taking orders over the telephone and have to take care of customers for what they were ordering for there companys. my co workers were very good at showing me any new things that i needed to learn.
bad,"Sysco  has good employees that work there that sacrifice there time and hard work. The management and dispatch is horrible, there expectation is ridiculous it's like they want a rookie to go out and perform like lebron James. They be all over your back when u don't get things done in a certain amount of time overall I was miserable and I wouldn't go back."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
bad,Say goodbye to your family. Say goodbye to your body. Say goodbye to your sanity. Sysco brings out a level of stress that only the thickest of skin can take.
bad,A typical day at work would be an average of 700 to 800 plus cases 13 to 17 stops sometimes even 19 and 20 seen some drivers with 22 stops yup it’s crazy especially if you have that many stops and cases on a 28 ft trailer!.. and on busy season forget it you will leave the warehouse sometimes an hour late even more!.. why because there’s no equipment for the routes you’re either waiting on a truck or waiting on management to figure out how there gonna get trailer for the route so yeah it’s kinda crazy down here sometimes but hey it’s food service so if you know you know!..
bad,"After 14 hours I still had quite a bit to unload, I called and asked for help. They told me to break federal law and just get it done.  After 16 hours I took the truck to the yard, and let them know the keys were in it and don't call me.  They pack as much as they can in the back of the trailer and say good luck!  The pay was awesome,  but you couldn't pay me enough to do that job. This job is rough! I I only"
bad,"The job is awesome. But the people are not. Because it is a production based job. Everyone is for themselves. No one works as a team...and it may just be me but it seemed like managment is looking to fire. It would have been better for a 24/7 operation if Sysco had a 1st 2nd and 3rd shift...now way they could loose, that's coverage all the way around. But instead. There is no set off time. You will work till the job is done."
bad,I worked in a very unorganized department.  Manager was never around.  Very little training and had nothing in writing to learn by.  I wanted to get my foot in the door and was planning on transferring out of the department after the mandatory one year commitment to the department.
bad,"During a typical day working at Sysco, I clock in at 7am and begin working on my tasks for the day. I have a fairly routine list of tasks (recycling cardboard, assist maintenance and other general warehouse maintenance). I am currently managing a new employee, which includes training, supervising and reporting to my manager about their successes as well as areas for improvement.The most enjoyable aspect of my job is my flexible schedule which allows me to work independently while also working with a team of employees."
bad,"N/A work life was not good, no time off. long hours, pay was good. if you like to work 6 days a week and never know what time your going to get off this is the job for you"
bad,"My job is being outsourced, with Sysco.   While I do not agree with this move, I will hope and pray that the folk that made this decision had the best interest of the customer's *(internal and external) in mind while making these very hard decisions.   I have loved working for this company and I have made life long friends and life long relationships that will never be broken and for that I am blessed."
good,"Sysco gives no support to the contract sales team . I was laid off after 14 years, It was called a head count reduction! There was a high turn over rate in sales . Sysco I thought was a great company to work for turned out I was wrong"
good,"Working at sysco, one thing is for sure! Their managent is wrecless with the lives of those who make the company ( warehouse-delivery) I worked two sixteen hour days:Tuesday and Friday, the other days were no less than 12 hours! "
good,Highly political environment in which most everone including management is primarily concerned with protecting their position and avoiding and conflict with senior management.  Favoritism is the norm and clicks exist at all levels.
good,Sysco's customers are amazing! They are why I get up in the morning. Management is dismal at best. The work life balance is impossible given the work load put on its employees.
good,"This company works 24 hours a day 365 days a year, very long hours with no brakes.  Pay is low to the work the company only needs a body to work and does not think of the person."
good,Good place to work was doing installs of beverage equipment and good employees that help when they were needed. Good working conditions some outside work when we installed equipment in customers facilities. Very friendly atmosphere to work in. Most work with a men in warehousing. In the year I was there never heard any negative talking. My department was closed do to down sizing and was outsourced to a small company.
good,"During my tenure here, I've learned a lot about myself. Most iof the shifts are at night which was uncomfortable for me. I don't recommend this job to a single mom."
good,"Openess is not fostered, but fear. Speak up and expect retaliation. "
good,They were very stressful company to work for it's not good for your health. The Pay used to be well they lowered it to make more money for themselves always overworked and underpaid
good,I worked athe the plant city ware house and it was so unorganized and we were forced to either take a day off because there was not enough work or we were working another day in that same week 12 or more hours. We had many people be hospitalized and could not function correctly a couple days later. We were penalised for useing our sick days that we were given. They worked on a point system if you went over a certen amount of points you were fired
good,"they care nothing for their employees. They have lots of promises that they don't keep. they took my district and dissolved it, taking all the accounts that I opened, gave them to some other salesperson and threw me out to the street with no compensation whatsoever."
good,"Great people to work with, management wasn't great.  Pay is based off of incentive per case/truckload, quicker you finish the higher the pay, but my schedule was poor to where I'm waiting for 1-2 hour for delivery that lowered my incentive.  Stores open late majority of time so a lot of wasted time.  85% there's problems with warehouse mispick and misloads.   Notified management nothing changes.  Benefits were okay they offer legal services BUT NOT legal services for employment I.e cdl has traffic violations they don't cover the legal service they offer just for personal coverage nothing for employment.  They take care of their old timers but give really bad routes and schedule to new comers even if your a hardworker.  Overall it was a good experience but I wouldn't recommend it"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,If upper management is displeased with you - look out. Took the new VP of sales 5 years but he finally culled me. Horrible direct manager last 5 years
good,too much work to little time to do it 
good,"Up in the morning problem solving for customers util the end of the day 5.00 PM. "
good,I will not say either good or bad as it is up to each individual to construct his or her own opinion. challenging and can be rewarding all at the same time. Each branch is run on its own accord
good,"Management needs an overhaul big time. A manager  shouldn't tell their associates that the new associates have to be taken care of over everyone else. No encouragement from management unless you are a buddy. And a veteran should not be told by New Management that they're thinking about how they do do their job too much, if we don't think about how we do our job we won't have customers which is why we are there."
good,"they needed junior admin but hired a very senior systems engineer, the work was well below my skillsets, i was very bored 99% of the time. they had me supporting legacy enviornments while permenant ires worked in the migrations to new technology"
good,"High volume, always busy . Management was friendly and professional. Not much job security"
good,"they are moving in directions i strongly disagree with, if you have a family this job will add so much excess stress, however if you are single and without children this job is great!  great potential to make good money and the benefits are really good compared to some of the other companies i have worked for"
good,camera watching all you cant talk on the phone no blue tooths or headphones leads to immediate termination loads are loaded poorly at least 65 percent of the time poor communication soon as something goes wrong on the drivers end they want to blow your phone up ask a question no one knows nothing get into accident no one will ask if your okay they only care about their trucks
good,This is a job for a young man with no family.The work is hard the hours are long the pay is good but you're gonna earn it.If you can stick with it you do get better routes but you get paid less because they are easier. Pay is based on the difficulty of the stop estimated travel time etc.
good,Good company to work for with a lot of opportunities. Its a demanding position. Long hours and hard work. A person has potential to make money.
good,"Time is of nature with any business, warehouse pick orders are very important. Company is very time and accurate co-ordination oriented.   Union based and not interested. My skills made me look elsewhere."
good,"If you are looking for a job and have a family, Sysco SBS is not where you want to be. The shift that you given is not one to balance with a family and you get points deducted for everything."
good,"I stuck there for 5 years for the money, no communication and favoritism infested work place. Fault free management. I saw 3 vp changes and 2 warehouse managers and no improvement."
good,"If you have a family, you will have limited time with them because of the hours"
good,"as a local support technician, I was tasked with monitoring, updating, upgrading and overall maintenance of call center solution, SAP BCM 6 & 7 (now named SAP Contact Center 7), it's peripheral equipment and the carrier services such as T1.5s, 100 MG circuits and network for VoIP.  I learned to various platforms in service of the SAP BCM such as SQL, some Python coding and direct interaction with SAP.  "
good,"My daily responsibilities was insuring my accounts were taken care of and I was expanding my territory. I learned true customer service by insuring every issue and problem was my problem...if my customers had an issue, then it was my issue."
good,"When i hired on at Sysco things were different. Soon after i got hired the vehicle allowance was cut, commisions were cut, the pension was cut. All of the things that made the job attractive when i got hired were all cut 4 months after i got hired. I would not suggest going to work for Sysco."
good,"bad atmosphere, uncaring management, willingness to discard employees"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,-Non-Stop
good,Delivery driver must work and have a great fitness pace unload boxes and moving inventory with different  restaurants and private companies etc day cab trucks
good,"Pay is very good, but do not expect anything else. Very hard labor, very long hours and no support from management. You are on your own. They will see how much you can do and then keep giving you more until you quit."
good,Good money very stressful a lot of digging for cases always tired and sore very hard to squeeze tractor trailer into a full parking lot with out hitting anything
good,"There was no fun at Sysco, all work. Dealing with union workers made everything more stressful do to they got away with doing so little or not doing anything that was asked by managers or supervisors."
good,They treat you as a number not a person. i did enjoy the training that was given in the beginning. The management was not as supportive as they could be.
good,"Sysco is a good company with their resources and product quality but they have lost sight of their quality people.  They were asking us to do things that were against my moral code.  They really treated their people great in the beginning then lost site of what great people they had working for them from the front office, warehouse, drivers and sales people.  It was truly sad."
good,"Great to be on the road daily meeting with customers.  Great sales and training resources.  unfortunately, you have to collect payments from customers which means you argue with the Credit Dept weekly.  Micromanaged greatly on everything you do.  Work 6 days per week plus holidays.  Pay structure is ok, but very difficult to make a great sales salary"
good,"Hardest part of the job is becoming friends with your co-workers, just to see their jobs eliminated.  Jobs do exist with Sysco but often times requires relocating.  Huge need for truck drivers and warehouse personnel."
good,Mentally nd physically  otherwise it'll destroy you and they don't train you properly so you gotta make it on your own they don't care trust me so jus
good,"Poor senior management at the West Texas Opco. If you are not part of the ""Minion Group"" you are not respected and ignored. When you are told you do not know how to ask questions, you know there are problems."
good,It’s a fast paced job and you have to have your numbers up to keep your job. They start you off in dry and once your numbers go up they stick you in the freezer or cooler where it’s doom for some
good,"Some things are really great about the core of Sysco, like the branded food items that they sell. They are concerned with safety and quality at the heart of that program."
good,"It started out as a great company to work for. The hourly wages have not kept up with the cost of living. Therefore, leaving the company in a poor position when trying to fill short positions. The benefits have been good as far as insurance, vacations, personal time off, etc."
good,very tough place to work management only care about production and not safety. Pay is great but you have to work extremely hard for it if you are a driver or work in the warehouse.
good,"Working straight nights, no room for future growth, I am looking for employment with future growth.  Management going in a different direction, company had several changes"
good,The favouritism limits your income. No room for advancement. They say it's a 5 day work wk but every schedule puts you for 6. Your set up for failure.
good,"heavy lifting with no time for family, just sleep. you will receive a lot of  overtime working 11-14 hours a day. they have supervisors coming to check on u as well"
good,"Dayshift employees are the best that I have ever worked with. Honest, caring and decent people. I would recommend anyone of them as I had several years working along side them."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Job was not that challenging and there was no position for advancement.  Training was not adequate.  This position was relocated to Corporate Office in Texas.
good,"Depending on the department you were in, you had long hours and the pay never matched. "
good,The job is a steady pace. The people are good people to work with. It is a cold work area. They give you the gear to do the job. Work is uselly steady pace. 40+ hours a week
good,"-Inbound/Outbound call center."
good,Sysco Virginia could be a good place to work. I didn't fit into the new plan of flooding the market with sales representatives so no one person could make money.
good,"There is a serious lack of trust regarding managment, Managers do as they wish in complete defiance of contract. Expect concerns to be ignored and treated as a ""disposable asset"". Turn over is extremly high and most new hires last only 3 months."
good,"The company is in transition, its probably not a good time to work for them. It could be a great place to work,but to many uncertainties to believe in your job."
good,"The benefits are great, if you work your tail off and catch a break early you will be benefitted. If not, you better hope you have a friend in high places."
good,If you value having a life then don't work here. The hours are way to long. Your often short staffed with no help from supervisor.  Their is two different pay scales and the new hires are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to pay
good,"Outside Sales position typically involves collecting payments, dealing with credit issues, and managing tasks that should be delegated to an inside sales rep"
good,"Coworkers were very helpful and pleasant. Very fast paced environment in which you are also micromanaged.  Corporate changes policies frequently and policies that are enforced change depending on the circumstance. Overall work moral is not good and a lot of turnover. A lot of daily duties required of you and not reimbursed accordingly. Human Resourses Dept. lacks in portraying correct information. Internal issues with deliveries and creates loss of business."
good,"I started four years ago but that has changed dramatically. Its an ordinary place of work, nothing special. People come to do their job that they are paid for and go home. I was very excited when"
good,Sysco is not in sync with the modern world low pay and poor management do not help this company live up to its full potential.
good,"Wouldnt want to work for sysco again. in the arizona location, the heat was pretty rough and there was a huge change going on with the us foods merger. once the merger didnt go through, alot of lay offs happened."
good,"this was a very fast job, you always had to look around to make sure no code worker was walking in the warehouse area where you was unloading boxes. they didn't have good air conditioner at the time I was working there so it could get really hot sometime."
good,"I was a delivery driver for Sysco. It started out great at first until I showed them a schedule to let them know that I was in college. After I told them that they said that they would accommodate me. WRONG!!!! They started giving me long routes so that I would be late for my 6:00 pm classes. The customers SUCKED!!! You had to kiss management's behind or become an Uncle Tom to work at that horrible place. They also attempted to merge with USA Foods but USA Foods decided not to merge with Sysco!!! I don't blame them!! I also complained to the management team about how terrible the truck loaders loaded my truck every morning. Guess what?? The more I told management the worse the loaders loaded my truck making it difficult for me to find the customers orders!! Oh, and they don't mention that you are timed on your route and you can possibly become in violation everyday if you are late delivering because of traffic or an accident etc. When it snowed in Jackson MS March 5, 2015, they were the only truck company that had their trucks rolling instead of issuing a delay. They have no regards for the drivers safety!! They hire temp secretaries that don't know what they are doing have the time. I feel sorry for the sucker that gets hired to work at Sysco!!!"
good,"one of the most stressful job, The people that ran this department did not know what they where doing. I had never worked in a work environment that was so dysfunctional."
good,Very hard work in a fast paced environment. The employees are forced to increase speed every few years. The pay is awesome but it comes at a price. You will be living to work not working to live.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. Enjoyable and very hard working cultural.
good,"To be entirely honest, the management sucks, co-workers are the only thing that keeps me going back there. Good people to work with, always laughing. "
good,"Very intense competition on the streets with very little loyalty in food service. Often dealing with competition undercutting. Sysco is very ""Corporate"" and has too many rules and regulations that often interfere with the selling process. On the territory street side, Sysco does not care enough about the customer unless their is potential for major expansion. Territory street sales focus on the ""mom and pop"" business, but all too often, the M&P are not big enough to deliver to. "
good,Not family oriented at all..long hours and lots of yelling from management
good,Excellent company.  The SAP implementation was pure hell due to understaffing and too large of scope.
good,Excellent training but the prices you are made to sell at will not let you be competitive and make you commissions.
good,"Beginning at 6 M I went over the daily reports to establish any possible issues.  I entered orders, solved problems (which ever they may be), and worked on new concepts with my clients during the day with face to face interaction.  I prospected new accounts, prepared detailed product listings tailored to each of their individual needs.  I introduced brokers to customers that I thought would be a good fit for the locations specifications for additional help.  At night I would update our data base on all of the particulars of the day, finishing around 9 PM."
good,"Top management is horrible. Lower and middle managers under severe pressure and constantly being shifted around and moved to other positions. Commission structure has changed so in the past couple of years that sales people are making 30-50% less than a couple of years ago. My last year there, I didn't run into any employee their who was pleased with the way things were going."
good,My days consist of balancing cultivating new business by cold calling and penetrating existing accounts. Making sure that my customers accounts are up to date. Managing and providing impecable service to my customers.
good,Chez sysco il y a toujours du travail et des heures supplémentaire a la tonne et a temps et demi donc tres agréable de ce coté. Mais travaille physique tres difficile et intense beaucoup de manutention pour les livraisons dans un reefer a -40 pas faite  pour tout  le monde.
good,"There is a lot hype of what you can make (100,000yr) but reality is after 2.5years I was still just making base pay. They make it nearly impossible to make good money. You start out with accounts no one wants because they dont make money. Only way to get good accounts are wait until someone leaves or gets fired, even then you are fighting others to get more accounts."
good,"Good Company but not room to grow in the IT field. People in this location is great, however, they are trying to reduce staff which makes hard to fulfill the workload"
good,Working for sysco was good at first. We had a change in our selection process. And the pay scale was supposed to go up .it never did.so that's why I'm seeking employment elsewhere.and I need to know my family is taking care of.
good,"I really hoped to finish my career with Sysco but"
good,"Max hours(DOT), Max work wheeling (dolly and ramp)food products. Tight window times to get done before you run out of hours all to do it again as soon as your 10 hour reset is up."
good,"I loved the job at first when I was still single I ended meeting someone and have a family and it was very hard to raise a family and keep up with the demanding shifts at Sysco. On average I worked 12 hours a day and being told the shift would end at 9 hours but since the next shift has a heavy workload they want to keep the previous shift on for a few hours to help that shift which is fine helping the other shift but shouldn’t be a requirement when it happens every day, working 12+ hours everyday when it wasn’t voiced in the beginning of my interview that overtime was mandatory would of been nice to know."
good,"Typical day is not too bad if you can work really fast "
good,"Blindsided,I was let go without any warning or notification. After two months of intensive training, you are led to believe that you are going to have two years to to fully develop in your territory. Then one month after an experienced MA transfers into your district you are told "" you are approaching your six months and we will not be continuing your employment"". DID NOT SEE THAT COMING! What I really don't understand is why a company would invest over 26K and then let a DSM represent Sysco in such a manner???"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"The money not worth the hard work, long hours and stress of this job."
good,Team leads are not the most knowledgeable . Review policy is poor requires employees to negotiate raises and apply for promotions. Requires next level work but promotions are non-existence.Has employee rewards program does not use it.
good,"Sysco has a vision and mission which they strive to accomplish; however, their leadership team lacks the drive, determination, and knowledge how to make that happen. They terminate and hire mid-level management nearly every 6 months and can't figure out why nothing changes; changes aren't overnight and after a few cycles one must admit it's senior management. Overall, the job is not horrible; you simply want a management structure that supports it's bottom line employees and provides quality equipment and support to accomplish the mission."
good,"Long nights in a freezer set at 20 Degrees pulling orders. equipment break downs are constant the working conditions are cold ,management wants your pulling % to be at 90 to 100 on a nightly basis."
good,"unorganized work environment"
good,"If sales is your thing you love, Sysco is great for you.  I'd never been in sales but decided to try it out.  Sysco is a good company as a whole, however sales is not for me."
good,"Started out great, but as the emphasis was put more on e-commerce and less on interacting face to face with customers job became hard to get excited about. Add in the lack of compensation for gas or car allowance and there were too many things I would have to do during the week that did not impact my paycheck in a positive way. "
good,"Very physical job, sometimes compensation isn't worthy of what we actually do. A blind eye turned by management when certain things are brought to their attention. Overlooked for  promotions because upper management don't like you personally, regardless if you're a good fit for the job and you're doing your job properly. New guys get preferential treatment over the veterans which the way I see it all employees should be treated equally. Unfortunately this is not the case"
good,on your feet all hours of ur shift. management give you routes that recommend 85% or above in short time period with is insane to me. the pay is not great till after you join the union.
good,"Sysco SBS was great to work for as a new company, management was part of the team and were leaders."
good,It's really hard to get used to this place. It's by far the biggest warehouse that I've ever work for. 12-16 hour shifts  5 days a week with 3 15 minute breaks.
good,"Company micro-manages all aspects of your life, not just sales. you become the face of Sysco and therefore for everything, including company mistakes."
good,The money you can make here is really good just be prepared for uncertainty and long long hours. Always carry overnight bag you will layover
good,Working at Sysco was an experience the pay was good and it has the potential to be a great place of employment. The days are long but it's a pretty smooth job.
good,"Once you are hired by Sysco they care about one thing, and one thing only....getting the groceries delivered to the customer. Your personal life does not matter."
good,"There was very little communication, hardly any credible organization of the tasks at hand and most of the drivers were ignorant idiots."
good,not possible to balance work life.     Great potential to much is asked fwith a poor manager to lead.   my experince with the company is poor but due to my manager and not the over all company
good,"Company still holds nice events (Picnic & Holiday Breakfast) for the associates and their families."
good,"Sales six days a week.  You are basically on your own. The majority of time is spent putting out fires.  Problems with orders occur daily.  Items out of stock, prices too high (compared to the competition), Items being left off the order, tech difficulties, drivers not showing up for work."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,i realy hard work in my company..any troubleshoot it will come i can solve immediately..i have not go to any places in my working hours
good,"Was exited to work for such a large company but soon came to find out that I made the worst mistake of quitting my job to work here. No training and God forbid you make one mistake your fired on spot, They set you up for failure. Someone gets fired and the entire dept knows why. Very uneasy feeling about working here. Looking to put my two weeks notice very soon not a stable place to be at. At least in this dept. Manager look at you like your stupid when you ask questions."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in at 7 p.m. then doing intense physical labor for anywhere between 8-13 hours in heat, cold and freezing conditions. "
good,"i currently work as an order selector in the warehouse in halifax, the company talks about safety all the time and training seminars, but in the 6 months i've been there we only did 1 little short training session, and that was only because the system went down. The management does not care about they're employees at all. They only care if you get your numbers, if you dont then they will fire you. I started in september 2014 and since I've been there they have fired 5 people because of theyre numbers and 12 people that started after me quit because they couldnt hit they're numbers. Sysco does not give you a chance to advance at all, they tell you they will train you on the forklift but they never do, the only perk of the job was the paying of incentive, but they changed it so much in 6 months that i was making 400$ extra a week to now i'm lucky to make anything becayse they want you to pick faster, scan more product labels, and not have any short on trucks. All in all sysco halifax employees have referred to the job as a slave movement, management takes takes takes but does not give anything in return."
good,Fast paced constantly changing environment that provides a challenging growth vehicle for a career. Days can vary but usually require quick adjustments to rapid changes.
good,"If you work hard they will work you harder. Always give you more work after finishing route. Makes you work your days off. Dangles bonuses to get performance then takes it away and make half of what your used to,"
good,Started as a good place to work. Became so demanding on workers because there were not enough people. Cant keep people because they expect way more than most people can do.
good,its okay....... this department doesn't advance ppl as often as they should and they micro manage
good,"Multitasking and Highly Political"
good,It is a job.Youre cold most of time and the management lets you know theyre in charge.
good,"Work Life balance would be great"
good,"A typical work day was hectic, but there were no egos between co-workers. We would all pitch in to get the job done, in hopes we could all leave on time."
good,"The company pays well, but doesn't care much about the low people on the company ladder."
good,Pay and benefits are fair. Management's dedication is to bottom line results most often. Workload often exceeds unrealistic timelines. Collaboration and communication are often lacking.
good,"Pay is best around. Great benefits. But the only shift you can work is the night shift. Shifts are long and your running hard constantly the whole time. Management has no help for you but is always stressing the tempo at which you work at. Job starts to consume your whole life. I would recommend this job to young people without children or other daily obligations. "
good,"While Sysco definitely offers excellent pay and above average benefits, the work/home balance was the toughest I have ever encountered. Two cell phones, constantly plugged in, and to be honest a lack of appreciation and inclusiveness from management."
good,"All the freedom you could want, but the pressure of hitting sales goals can be overwhelming.  While there is a lot of support available if you don't ask for it,it won't come to you.  You control your destiny."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Hard work but you get use to it. Make great money but no life outside of work except you get Saturday off every weekend. Have to work in different areas (dry, cooler, freezer)"
good,"Promotes from outside when quality is already in the building. Would love to finish career there, but my career bike is a huffy and not a nautilus...."
good,A great benefits and people however the upper  management does very little to help new employees become acclimated to the “Sysco way” of doing things.
good,"Long hours, physical work, Great pay. The biggest problem is the guy routing either had to much to do or just plain dont care. Yes they pay you to deliver but sometimes your home life is worth more than the money."
good,Appears upper management team does not embrace commodity buying.  Want the pay out but not willing to take the exposure nor pay for the correct team members.  Would like to see a revamp of systems and how commodity items are priced and offered out to sales force / customers.  Lot of internal change and ideas going on but still not willing to be the leaders in the industry.
good,Okay place to work but often felt left out of the loop.  Lack of ability to see outside made it a bit depressing.  No where to eat or walk outside.  Free lunches and snacks were a nice perk.
good,Fast-paced and strong sales environment; not suited for everyone.  There are some great leaders in the local company.  There does need to be a culture shift and that is one of the biggest challenges.
good,"It was once a career. Now its just a job."
good,When first starting it was a great fast paced place to work. Soon enough corporate took over and it wasn't as personal any longer. Most everything is done at the corporate offices
good,"company is attempting to change too much, too fast."
good,felt this company was a male dominant organization. Cult like environment. if they didn't like you were chastised. this happens especially if you are a female.
good,Good people at Sysco.  Solid company with long history of growth and being the largest purveyor in the world.  Work load is high and leaves associates feeling guilty when they peel themselves away to go home knowing  tasks were not completed.  Compensation is humbling for high expectations.  Resources limited.
good,"The company itself is great but working there in the office was terrible. There was so much back stabbing and gossiping. If you didn't belong or go along with the right group of girls, they would make your life miserable. Management was just as bad."
good,The problem with Sysco is that they take the time to train you for the job but then have no follow up when you need it.  They set expectations w/o support to achieve them.  If they truly wanted to reduce turnover and grow their business they would have spent more time with the new hires to ensure they were successful.
good,"Sysco used to be a great place to work.  Now that they have decided to make more money they have outsourced putting people out of their jobs."
good,This company is a very fast paced place to work. For the stressful work environment and lack of training the pay does not match the work load. The company does not take care of their employees after an injury and does not allow time off until after 6 months or more.  They do not explain their online system very well and technical issues with their equipment makes it hard to keep up with quotas.  Your breaks are included on your timing for your daily scores and at times you don't even get breaks.
good,"Many of the workers have been here for at least 5 - 10 years with many at 20. For an average person working here the compensation is the same as any others. The benefits are not drastically different. For management roles, the compensation structure is dramatically different and is quite rewarding if you're at this stage in your career."
good,it was stressful at times and also not being able to see my daughter and the hours were very unpredictable. It has great benefits and oppurtunities. This company also has options as far as moving up in the company.
good,"Don’t do it. You never have “time off” because a customer or manager needs something from you. You put a lot of miles on your car without getting paid mileage. Morale is low and whatever you do isn’t good enough. You will never make more than $900 a week, and for that go elsewhere where you will make more money without the hassle and the stress.  "
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"The work there as an order selector was very fast pace and the equipment that was used to scan had a lot of lag, making it hard to make quotas and then the driving and unloading was just as hard as you had to drive threw many busy place with had to find parking."
good,The job is not suited for a work / life balance.  the demands and goals are lofty.  The environment was toxic with office politics at the forefront.  The training is excellent allowing an employee to work for competitors successfully.
good,"Always shortage of drivers because of treatment of current drivers. Overworked and no appreciation from management.Besides the pay, I have nothing good to say about Sysco."
good,"Overtime knows no limits at Sysco! Pay is high, but at the expense of a personal life. An average work week for night selectors can be up to 50 plus hours!"
good,"Long hours and working 6 days a week, "
good,"The company is great. But some managers did not provide their staff what the needed. The job it's self was fun, really like it. Would work in this kind of job again."
good,"You're either on the ""in"" or on the ""outs"". Not many are in between. It doesn't have to do with how hard you work either it's how well you play the game. Good Luck!"
good,"corporate influence had eroded morale, lower commission, constant changes in personal, it was a ""revolving door"". used to have a small company culture with family like atmosphere. very corporate culture when I left."
good,I enjoyed my job . I enjoyed coming to work and working as a team .  i would lime to work for a like minded company with better management and organization.
good,I worked here for a summer while i was going to school.  I liked the longer shifts and how there was lots of hours available.  It was fun  driving the electric pallet jacks around when loading your skids of food and produce for the orders you got.
good,Long work days not a good balance work to Home per day management seem to make it hard for drivers truck loads and route orders not to good a lot of searching for products you need for the stop you’re at
good,Big company in process of changing. Territory sets the parameters of success. Opportunities to strive a limited. Drivers were very professional and efficient. Distributor price fluctuation has trained the customers to play one against the other - bad for running a business because price becomes more important than innovation and sale professionals can not afford to spend time helping the owner reach their goals.
good,"I enjoyed everyday that I arrived to work, the work load was challenging and I enjoyed every bit of it.  The supervisor was awesome.  The environment is warm and welcoming."
good,early AM start times. heavy lifting and lots of walking. based on seniority of work so if you at the bottom then you dont get the good routes. worked only four days per week. so little overtime. call ins are on a point system. drive cameras in every truck .
good,"money to hours worked is terrible. 65-70 hours to  hopefully get your work load completed"
good,"You have to call in each night around nine o clock to find out what time you work in the morning. could be three a.m could be five a.m. paychecks looked very nice, but you work 70 hours a week."
good,Sysco was a good place to work. Management was great until Corporate came and Terminated the good managers and letting go of senior employees. cutting any overtime
good,"Management lost focus of workforce, management became focused on bottom line and forgot to ensure the employee was paid to keep production of the bottom line"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"I enjoyed my time at SYSCO Food Services and the diversity in my job duties on a daily basis, I never knew what to expect. The positions in my department were eliminated with no notice whatsoever, the day before I was to receive an award for the performance of a special group that I was responsible for training and developing. No job security.  The management that was there when I was hired was excellent, but as things changed, the new management was not quite the same caliber as was the original."
good,the company has decent pay and great benefits for you and your family the company use to do a lot for the driver now it is almost obsolete and they have there picks
good,"Sysco is a large company.  The pros is that there were great insurance benefits, vacation time, FMLA, etc. if needed.  Client oriented was another positive.  The cons is if you are looking to form friendships or warm working relationships you really won't get that family vibe.  It's just too large and busy.  Human Resources was great."
good,I just wanted a job where I can show my intelligence and brains. Sysco is just boxes and trucks. I see more out of my life then a warehouse forever. U have to be a beast to work here.
good,Sysco is a good company to work for.  Highly competitive work environment.  With potential to earn 6 figures. Love their dedication to service and systems for their customers.
good,"stress,on making delivery times ,cameras in trucks watching everything you do,almost always 12 to 14 hour days just enough time to eat and go to bed and do it all over again.the pay is good,benefits,are fair.just no family time.and just my opinion i think they got there priorities backwards, think they lost sight of customer relations or customer satisfaction,its all about producing its like they want you running all the time."
good,"As a Marketing Associate, an average day would consist of 10-12 customer calls.  It was always a pleasure to show new products to help the customer with new and profitable menu items."
good,Hard manual labor job unloading a tractor trailer with the use of a hand cart for 12 to 14 hour days.  Going into work before the sun is up and returning home after the sun is back down.  Very little family time and poor quality of life.  Pay is better then average but could be better compared to the physicality of the job.
good,Union contract is very company biased. Union policies are more strict and anti-driver than company policies.  Supervisors etc..are difficult and unresponsive to concerns. Co-workers are lazy and non professional.
good,"Interacting with restaurant owners, helping customers improve their business using various methods, sampling new products, lots of driving in a defined territory, good pay.  Recognition program."
good,Good pay.  Tough atmosphere.  Voice is not heard by management.  Too separated from higher ups.  No opportunity for advancement.
good,"YOu get thru the class room, must unload trailer via handtruck of pallet, training is ok, you make good money but they are all about speed and efficency,. if your slow or take your time they will let you go. Overall the money is great there. they work in all weather, they dont care if its 16 inches of snow you must come in to work on time and expect to go out. zero tolerance."
good,I am a very great delivery driver but to be honest i believe id like to work for a company where we could make the deliver and let the sales dept deal with any issues that might come about with customer.  Unfortunately company's that deliver when customer is present usually takes everything out on the driver. Drivers can not control mistakes made by warehouse or sales but have to resolve there errors and listen to the customer which takes time from the route and  put other devilries pending behind schedule.  The thought of working for a union was a positive thing for me after working for the company it is the reason why co workers don not work together because  everyone is too prideful about there senority they dont allow new comers to be comfortable.  I like to concentrate on my job and i am not very talkitive sometimes people might take that as a bad attitude but when i come to work its time to work and not there to be the most like or whatever.
good,Great flexibility with in the position in the job.  Unreliable ability to count on income.  Company is in a tough transition on how to bring more income and not lose complete touch with employees.
good,"Horrible employee Moral."
good,Extremely fast paced work environment.  Good Company to work for but they don't turn temporary employees into permanent ones.
good,"Very relaxed culture - jeans, sandals, large cube setting, great teamof people."
good,"Be ready to work from the designated start time to whenever everything is done. Which means there is no actually daily end of work time. You may get off early on one day and the next day is different. You have to be strong and fast if not you will fail at this job. The pay is great but you'll miss out on your personal life style. Be expected to work 6 days a week, and also be ready to lose a lot of weight."
good,"I wish I could get back into one of the Operating Companies.  The people are REAL!  Not like at SBS or Corporate.  The OpCos' deal one to one with the customers and know what is really going on! "
good,"They are constantly writing you up for every little thing you do. They hire and fire like I've never seen in my life. They will fire you for anything they can!! They hire 10 warehouse employees a week and about 1-2 will actually make it. 100s of workers have come and go"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Company  does not promote from within - when you are in the hining phase, you are told there is a lot of potential for advancement, but once hired, the company tends to keep you in your current position without giving you an opportunity to advance"
good,"Average benefits with an average 2 -3% increase annually with LONG Work hours. Don't look for anyone to notice you or give you praise. Always new rules being handed down from Sr. Management, you never know what to expect next."
good,Pays well but the management is hard to work with. good co-workers hardest part is managemnt
good,I was in accounting a/p and a/r departments. I also worked at vendor distributions. I did bookkeeping and driver check in and special events for the vendors. The co-workers were nice but spread out and unaccessible easily. I loved working with the company and when they moved the distribution center to Lewisville the rules and leadership changed. It was tough but a very nice job. I loved the work and management. I deeply enjoyed working with all the vendors.
good,You have very little family life due to hours and Very poor management unless you are a favorite.
good,"Day to day isn't all that bad, cold calling on customers, taking orders from current customers and dealing with any issues that may arise. "
good,I believe there should healthy environment in work position.It motivates employee to go further otherwise distracts from the work.This is human tendency peoples work should be appraised and awarded.
good,"the hardest part of the was the lifting and sorting items in a pallet. percentage is unreasonable. but if you love a very physical job this is for you,"
good,"A typical day was starting work at about 2PM at bacon plant where I inspected the quality of product being shipped."
good,"Its good but limited."
good,"A typical day at work consists of stretches followed by announcements.  After announcements everyone heads to their triple jack and begins.  After 7.5-11 hours of stacking boxes (with two half hour breaks) everyone packs up and goes home."
good,I enjoyed my time with Sysco.  It is a great company with many great employees.
good,I started working on night shift back in Sept of 1999. I held several jobs while in the shipping dept. I took a job in the maint dept back in 2004. My primary job was to work and service equipment such as forklifts and pallet jacks. Often I would be asked to help with building maint. I would work on dock doors and dock lights along with resurfacing the floors. Whatever was asked of me I would do.
good,you kinda did your own thing here the pay was bad mangers wore bad as well 
good,"Pros: good bunch of coworkers, great money, great benefits"
good,Lacked sufficient training to ensure comfort level for a newly hired employed.
good,"Managed vendor agreement accounts, performed weekly reports and performed other assignments."
good,good place to work but takes up most of your time
good,"I work mid nights and a typical day is 10 hours. At first the job seemed promissing but i have reason to believe that after 1 year of employment. I will be terminated regardless of work preformance, Working 10 - 12 hrs a day 6 days a week is the worst part because i dont get to spend much time with my family."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"no advancement, good flexibility, management is questionable"
good,The work was fulfilling. Unfortunately the leadership structure was far too secretive.     Nepotism the wrong people were given greater opportunities.
good,"The job was very fast paced. No time to even look at clock. I really didn't like how they acted like safely was number one priority, it really wasn't. All they cared about were numbers the ""bottom line."""
good,Hardest part of the job was the excessive overtime each month end  I learned many new systems I have never seen before Sysco.  Most enjoyable was the great people I worked with.  Many levels of Management.
good,"fast paced, and i learned a lot. from picking to stacking , to replenishing stock. i even learned how to work in the freezer. with proper protective gear of course."
good,"It is a place where you have the opportunity as a driver to make a lot of money. You can be home with your family every night."
good,If you have the opportunity to work at Sysco foods you should take it. You will have the ability to train with the best people in the food industry. Every day you will learn something new. Great place and good people.
good,"It could be fun, was a very highly competitive field that i enjoyed.  I got to interact with a lot of interesting people, as I made multiple calls a day."
good,The job is interesting on a day to day challenge stand point. Never the same issue comes up or how you end up having to deal with it. The bigger problem is the fact that there is little direction on how to correct larger problems like staffing or teamwork issues from upper management.
good,"Once they want to get rid of you, youre gone. Everything seems great until you get the job once they have you. youre just another body. and they make that known!"
good,"A lot of hours. decent money, hard work. normal day is about 12-14 hours. there is a bunch of turnover in other areas which directly effects your job and how it gets done."
good,I have loved my job.  There are just not enough people to cover it all.  Too much on my plate. Work too many hours and still don’t have time to get it all done
good,People were not very friendly and the hours were bad if you wanted to have a life. The managers were not very helpful due to the union workers. Overall Sysco is not a bad company if you don't mind the hours and work environment
good,Great work environment. Team work environment. Over time pay is generous. Uniforms and safety shoes provided at no cost to you. Occasional cook outs and company celebration. Friendly coworkers. Company benefits are on level and competitive.
good,A lot is moving to the corprate office in Texas. Management is alright but there are some that are difficult to work for. The culture is alright can be a little mixed vibe at times.
good,It's extremely hard to maintain production levels with really long hours worked. Oh and make just two mistakes for the week and loose out on all of your bonus money. Once that happens you won't wanna work very hard knowing what you could of been making. This job will break your body.
good,"work was hard but there if you wanted it. overtime was available, coming early or leaving late was fine.  you will get a ham and a turkey for thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,Good place to work evenings and nights with good pay. Hard and fast paced work. No set time schedule. Get off work when all orders are selected. Overtime is usually a guarantee.
good,"Sysco is a good company that generally treats people right. However, there is also a lot of room for it to improve and get up with the times in terms of benefits."
good,"Tough job with long hours. A lot of heavy lifting of cases to and from stores. Very busy. Good pay and benefits, but not a good work-life balance. Typical day is 12 hours."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Worked there for 3 years on the sales desk. Things were okay in the beginning until some of the core staff starting moving on to different departments, instead of filling their spots with reliable skilled individuals they either increased the course load on the rest of us by A LOT - suddenly we were doing tasks outside our job descriptions and doing the work of multiple people... or they would begin to hire people that didn't fit the job but rather just the ""image"" they were trying to achieve as a company - clearly skill set started to not matter. In result this created a high turnover rate near the end of my time there. "
good,"It’s a hard fast paced job but if you can do it it most definitely pays well the benefits are awesome,management isn’t good one bit you will feel like a robot there it’s all go go go to get the job done,you will work a lot of hours every week for sure"
good,Driver moral was very low. The company was very fast pace. The drivers and management didn't always see eye to eye. For the most part the work days were very long.
good,Do you want to give up your life for a company that treats you like you really don’t matter? How does being plugged in seven days a week sound? What about not being able to take a vacation out of fear of inadequate coverage?
good,"Stressful job, work too many hours, very hard on your body, needs a better management team. Needs to work on structure inside the warehouse and need to be more team players."
good,Was a great company to work for things changed with budgets and the economy Got told they were letting go upper management and we had nothing to worry about our jobs were secured. Come into work with HR at my desk my manager didn't even know they were letting me go as in laid off. I asked to go to my desk to collect my personal belongings was told no and I wasn't allowed to say good bye to anyone. I would not recommend Sysco.
good,Sysco is a leader in the industry but has challenges with keeping some employees for a long time. I wanted to retire from this company but wasn’t in the cards. Excellent training ground for food service experience.
good,"Disipline is key, start times are from 02:00 - 05:00, four day weeks, 14 hour days. Unloading 10,000 pounds to 20,000 punds of food by hand cart by yourself. If you enoy physical hard work, then this jon is for you."
good,"I’m a long term employee (over 15 years) of Sysco and held several different leadership positions. Working for the company continues to get more and more demanding as they continue to require more time and energy from you. In turn, they become less flexible with working schedules or any type of comp time.  I am salaried and it never ceases to amaze me how one can regularly work 50-60 hour per week, and when you decide to take a day off you’re expected to use a vacation day. When you return to work you have to work even longer to catch up from the day you were off.  Work life balance sucks with this company.  Coworkers in my area and our business partners at corporate regularly send emails at 10pm, 2am and all other hours outside of our ‘normal’ work time.  Where is the companies compassion for their associates and their families?  I don’t think it exists. "
good,Pretty much made your own schedule it was your business to maintain. Communication between management and associates is on a need to know basis and played favorites with select employees
good,Sysco doesn't appreciate their long term employees and have a reputation for letting employees go after 15-20 years.  They do have great benefits and I loved my job.
good,Always walking around on eggshells … turnover extremely high for drivers and management   They don’t  make the majority of the drivers or management feel like their part of the team which in turn creates low moral.
good,"Corporate Office: A ton of emphasis is put on ""following the process"" and hitting rushed timelines regardless of whether more time/focus needs to be spent on a task to ensure that it is thorough, correct, and makes sense.  Very much a ""check the box and keep moving"" environment where things often resurface because the time and attention was not put into the task on the front end. Senior leadership does not create an environment for career growth - there are opportunities but you are on your own to discover and pursue them (with the exception of a few good managers) - promotions and lateral moves can be blocked by senior leaders. Workloads can be hard to manage - still not 100% centralized so a lot of your annual goals and targets are out of your control and up to the field to execute and carry out."
good,Worked many hours a day and holidays.  No work/life balance.  They did not care about family time for their employees.  I hope it has changed over the years.
good,"Business to business sales of food service products"
good,"I’ve been reeling in 60+ hours every week as a packer and for the last few years I’ve been with sysco, 1/3 of the time (recently) we’ve been well understaffed and corporate just tells you to pick up the workload like ya nothing to them. We’re all burnt out from the 11-14 hour shifts... on top of that sometimes theyll tell you you need to speed it up (our performance) but in reality these are sales people. Sitting at a desk and answering calls all day. All 8, maybe 10 hours a day. It always starts with one guy calling in too. That adds about an hours worth of work for every guy that calls in. And our Opco is short almost 10 guys. There’s about me and only a handful of others that reluctantly stuck around this last year. It’s really brutal on your body and if you’re a “gamer” and not like a natural athlete, this job may be too much for you."
good,I would work in the freezer. Get my forklift and get pallets of food down from big rigs. Then seperate the food in the order the food store wanted them
good,"it was quite an experience to work with, learned how handheld scanners worked and to keep working hard till the duty was done, I liked the heavy lifting of the work any labourer work I enjoy doing."
good,"if your not willing to work hard and at a fast past then don't apply its not a job for folks coming from a relaxed or slow past environment , pay is by how many trucks is unloaded daily"
good,the job is good job overall but not hard to balance work and social life due to hours. management team is very fair and co workers are friendly and helpful.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Good people and good company. Very good benefits and the stock buy option is great.  Pay is a little low but they feel they can get away with it so they do.
good,Hardest part of the job is working on sundays compulsary. I learn to read and check precast drawings before production. Checking of quality of quality of precast before delivery to site.
good,"Nothing is ever good enough, once you hit a goal or even blow away a history, nothing is ever done and you are to continuously grow that fast at all times. Living in a small community that kind of growth isn't possible on a regular basis. There has to be some falling. This isn't tolerated all and if you don't grow you are gone. Management only cares about their numbers and not how they can help you with yours. "
good,It was a very different experience that I did enjoy very much. It was very fast paced which it kept me very busy. Team work was essential for all the many changes and challenges that came about due to the transition in corporate taking over most of the Contract Compliance Department.
good,"The job is very stressful due to the sales growth expected every month.  Sysco does offer training especially in product knowledge.  They want to ensure all associates have the proper knowledge to succeed in selling to current and potential new customers.  The benefits are wonderful and the pay is competitive with the industry."
good,Typical day is all over the place from chasing trucks on routing to chasing money from customers. Constantly doing busy work. There is not a real balance between work and family life.
good,"Everyday, we are challenged to grow our business.  The job takes teamwork and consistency.  Doing things right the first time helps to build trust with our customers and sets us apart from the competition."
good,Longterm model for retention of employees isn't very good.  Work-life balance is optional.  Lots of competition from other companies that make job extremely hard. Money is what you make of it.
good,"Typically you will work 12-16 hours a day driving a route that will be assigned to you that day. "
good,worked long hours as an order selector onto palletjacks...loader of trucks...forklift replenisher....pay is top of the industry but working 5-6 days a week 10 or more hours every day takes its toll
good,"Fast pace"
good,"Great benefits. Good working conditions and flexible time off. Wonderful people that work at Sysco. Sysco is always striving for more business. Sales is a big part of this company,"
good,"My trailers were delivered to me, I was rural. The loads were terrible. Pallets tipped over, damages to products, which drivers have to pay for unless called in, as with shorts. Pallets loaded top heavy.  Management don't really care about anything, no matter how much you tell them about loads, don't expect anything to be done. The plus side, I had great customers, most would accept damaged boxes, as long as products are ok, nice runs in the country. I got fired because 2 pallets tipped over, and needed a dock to fix it. Top heavy load."
good,"Excellent work culture. Great people. Direct managers were located in another city, so lacked support and communication. "
good,"Bad management if i was you i run , no growth in this company when deal didnt go through with u.s food. Sysco just say forget about of us and took money away from us to make up for what lost on the deal that didnt go through"
good,"taught me how to work hard no matter what the condition were. good customer service skills. great company to work for, management up and down when it comes to communication with the delivery drivers."
good,Get plenty of rest and eat your Weaties. 12 to 16 hr days. Lack of communication in upper management.Rules are being made and changed on a daily. If your a new driver you will be put on different routes daily with little assistance. Most trailers are loaded to the gills. On the flip side great group of coworkers and lots of teamwork.
good,"Being in Sales for Sysco is challenging and can be rewarding.Great pay can be achieved very easily, however the market is so competitive that your working for a pay check every week."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,They do not care about their employees they only care about how much work they can get out of you.  They will work you the maximum hours allowed.  Do not value you.
good,"Job stability and benefits are exactly what you would expect from a company this size. Very hard to get fired unless you do something really stupid or just don't show up. Insurance is good for the most part although Obamacare has increased premiums on healthcare."
good,Decent job it paid the bills. Taxes took out a good chunk. You work long hours. You do get a hour lunch. My supervisor was ok. You do get to meet amazing people.
good,"Overall, working for Sysco has been a good experience, with great flexibility, decent compensation, and a stepping stone for my professional career. "
good,"Driving around to all of the Restaurants within a 50 Mile Radius.  Selling Food to Kitchen Managers, Owners and Food Service Personnel.  Very Challenging and Fast Paced.  Long hours including weekends, not much Family Time.  Great Pay and Exposure to many people."
good,"Good starter job, if your flexible and adaptable to constant change. The Company is growing and expanding, but the challenges around that can be developmental or treacherous depending on who is leading you."
good,the job was okay. The good outweighs its bad. The money is good but its intense hard work. It's not for everyone.The hours are long.Management is laid back. For the most part they follow all DOT regulations.
good,hard place to work but once  you get use to the pace of everyday loads you'll be ok i liked it because i didn't have to work out after work hated it sometimes cuz neva had time for my daughter
good,"Working nights from 4 pm until everyone is done. About 2 am to 4 am.The pay is good if management doesn't screw you over to where you default ( make base pay, lose about $7 an hour). The job is expected to be hard. Moving cases constantly for 10 to 12 hours. But thats not the problem. Its all management that creates the worst work place. They dont run the crew right. They single people out and give them the hard work and cause them to make less. The more you know how to do for this company the less you make. You are better being a new person and dont learn any other positions other than order selecting. Thats where you will make the most. The company does promote within. But be cautious of what position you move to. In particular positions on the night shift."
good,"Workers are provided good training and on going training. Management is good at what they do."
good,"When being hired Sysco was under process of converting all US broadline companies to SAP.  There were a lot of growing pains along the way and effective 2/29/16 they are doing away with the SAP platform and moving back to their old OS.  There was going to be growth and opportunity, but now they are laying off again (a lot to do with the failed merger with US Foods) and underway with an aggressive 3 year business plan to cut administrative costs by $500 million company wide.  Have always heard great things about Sysco prior to being hired, but unfortunately was not able to see what I heard."
good,"Former driver for 2 years out of Central Florida, one of the largest.  I loved the fellow drivers, and challenging routes.  Must work nonstop fast and be very organized to break down the pallets for all the stops.  divided into 3 sections: Freezer, cooler, and dry.  Pay is excellent, but beat tired at night, so need understanding spouse. Each stop timed, if fall behind get ""help"" from a supervisor, who will only write you up.  Drive cameras also record you all the time.  The physical challenge and brainwashing micromanagement ultimately lead to my leaving, miss the 1500$ a week though."
good,Most enjoyable part of job was working independently. Drove tractor trailer delivered food to customers. If i had any issues it was an open door policy with management. Everyone at the company was great to work with had no problems with coworkers. Hardest part was working in all weather conditions and very long hours 65 to 70 hours a week. Made great money just not much time at home.
good,"Fun work place at times but mostly about the numbers. Push management team to meet numbers at all costs. Personal growth and development is a high priority. Big corporation with moderate amount of red tape and politics. At times, feels like its most about the numbers, and not the employee."
good,"- Sempre a mesma rotina, e as mesmas atividades."
good,Enjoy team members and Team lead have learn a lot from management and lots of perks for employees. Environment is very enjoyable.
good,"Great Place to work,  Very laid back.  The work is rather easy and the people there are great.  This place will always look out or you,"
good,"Great coworkers. Under paid for what you do. Continuously rolls out new policies but fails to train staff on how to implement them. ""Who you know"" plays very heavily into advancement."
good,"A typical day at work was making sales calls on customers.  Fun, fast paced, performance-based environment.  Enjoyable customer-relationship building culture."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Good company with great co-workers.  Advancement is very limited and so is compensation.  Set your own hours as long as the work gets done.  Upper management lacks support for field employees.
good,"During my tenor with Sysco I have learned to implement various sales techniques, worked with a broad range of clients attended educational seminars and trade shows. its a good company to work for."
good,"Fast paced company with large workloads and the expectation of working long hours and possibly weekends. Sales Force is very favored all around, office staff does not get much recognition for a lot of hard work. Nice people with good pay and benefits, opportunity for advancement if you are able to meet the right people."
good,"Maintain pricing for assigned Sysco suppliers. I have learned Supply Chain functionalities, costing updates, and internal bill-back system while managing dual systems. Management is flexible and often hands on. My co-workers are team players who take the lead when assistance is needed. I often struggle with pricing not updating properly due to system problems which have been known to delay pricing. The most enjoyable part of the job the relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Sysco is a well balanced employer, with ethnics and structure."
good,very productive place to work. enjoyed the fast pace.keep me in shape.
good,"I feel that employees should be listened to more and not just by other people Managers like.  I learned grreat customer service skilss and loved working face to face with them in the will call offce.  I feel managerment could work a bit more on the department they were incharge of.  By working more one on one with to see how we did things and let us know what we could improve and what we do great on.  Not pull you in with three other managers to get on your case about one things.  The hardest part of my job would be getting into trouble all the time, while other could do the same thing and nothing would happen.  The most enjoyable part would have to be working with everyone in the Will Call offce, and having that face to face contact."
good,"I have worked hard at my job.  A typical day at Sysco is every changing.  Credit is there to collect money but also to work well with the sales representative.  "
good,A typical day in the Accounting dept could depend on the date. Extra busy during month end but very slow during the other weeks.
good,The perfect high paying job for a young individual with no college degree.
good,Complex job with many daily highs and lows. Frustrating and rewarding at the same time.
good,"Worked swing shift. Not very good shift for a family. Never home at night, missed a lot of after school activites"
good,Work is very busy and can consist of 200 plus emails each day. Hard work is rewarded for incented group but only if you make your profit plan
good,"Not much to say about this company. Long days and a ton of pressure. Be sure not to leave you cell phone home on the weekends, because you need to be at your customers beckon call all day everyday."
good,"- The hours can be difficult to adjust to - there are shifts that run into the mid-afternoons. "
good,"I am currently employed,I have a suspicion that this post will be wiped eventually. This company is a hot mess. "
good,"The pay great, benefits are great, the job is hard, but they are too strict with there policy’s.  Especially if you use your phone while driving.  They will not give you any warnings, they will fire you on the spot."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,the owner op. program was and is the biggest scam ever.Its riddled with kick backs and corruption they listen to b.s. rather than common sense and experience.
good,"Descent pay .the more you do the more they put on you.love the work just no home time.up and down stairs,lots of alleys so be good at backing. And in winter shovel customer walks before you can even deliver. Most customers are great ."
good,"Compensated for hours and level of dedication put into work. Long days not typical for a family life. If you are young and single with no children, facility has everything to help build yourself financially and physically for the next phase of your life."
good,"Great people "
good,for my first job in the administration world I the experience i have gained at this job has bee fantastic. great benefits and food perks. location in not the greats and I drive for over an hour to get t work everyday.
good,It is not a bad company to work for. The supervisors and managers that controlled Grand Island to North Platte area. Are very good very hard-working guys they're there for the other guys and I believe that they do their best at their jobs. But they can only do so much ..before...their hands are tied their hands are tied
good,Sysco is behind the times. They are working on it but way behind for a huge corporation. The CEO is making changes. Senior managers are the worst. Need to clean house
good,"I had worked for a Sysco Operating Company and moved to Texas specifically to work for Sysco Business Services and Sysco Corporate.  Over 9 years I moved through 7 roles with little to no training in each of those roles. "
good,"Company benefits are great, the management staff are 50/50 supportive and helpful.  You must be willing to commint to having no life for the 1st several years to even have a shot at building a descent terriory and making commission and bonuses.  Tons of micormanaging admin work to do every week.  Highly competitive environment and as with any sales position you must be able to withstand an onslaught of rejection."
good,"Sysco is a great company to work for. If the culture around the warehouse could change, that would make Sysco the greatest company to work for. They compensate workers nicely but 1 off day is all that is allowed at the moment"
good,I did not like there style you never when you were going be off or when you were going to work schedule you for work for 3:00 am might be on standby until 7or 8 am then take you on a route your day may end 8:00 pm right back to work at 4:am to much chaos.
good,"Very hard work, lots of lifting, early morning start, high stress. Equipment breakdowns frequent,  management not easy to work with, hard to get time off."
good,Good place to work. Have a lot of good benefits. Steady pace work environment. Work hours are good. Convenient location for travel. Good portal to receive and update information.
good,Good place to work at.  Face paced. Good people.  Friendly environment. Enjoy the competitive nature of the job.  Trained to work in various positions.
good,"Sysco is a well organized company to work for. They have good processes, policies and procedures.  A safety focused culture who care about their employees. Great opportunity for starting your career. Not much room for advancement."
good,"Deliver food products to customers, Its a fast paced job if your delivering. Not so bad running shuttle, but you work at nigh. I had two lay offs, they work you until you make to much and then lay you off and hire back on at starting pay."
good,Overall it was a decent place to work. They need better communication all around. The employees in the warehouse seem to get looked over and not noticed for their hard work.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Sysco was changing before I left, greatly increased Micro managing. Lots of driving, and prospecting.  I learned how to do menu engineering . Management could not be trusted. It was a rough work place culture, out of 200 sales reps. there was only 3 African American's, and 2 Hispanics. The hardest part of the job was going to the monthly meetings. The best part of the job was the promotions for prizes."
good,I want to work for a company were I can grow and is up to dated with technology. Sysco is a good company to work at for most people not for everybody.
good,Very long but productive days; yearly positions cut but the same work load; extremely outdated and very slow systems (you sit and wait while workload is growing). Customer oriented organization (customer is always right). Nice people to work for.
good,"POOR  management AND THEIR LEADS ARE BAD"
good,It’s a great career if you don’t get fired before you make Union. Pay is phenomenal but management is out to get you. You can’t slow down. There is never an excuse to be late
good,if you like a face paced never slowing down until your done then this is the job for you. delivering food in and out of a truck non stop until your last stop. pay is good but they will work you to death. faster you become the more stops they put on you.
good,Good company.  Very hard job. Overall the company is a good place to work. My skill and ability are being wasted doing a delivery job. I enjoy the customers and satisfying their needs. No where to move up as a driver. The job is for no one over the age of 40.
good,The new team lead and director are both micro management. They push down tons of work to senior accountants. Work is great with new technologies.Employee turn-over is too high but they refuse to take responsibilities.
good,Truly the experience would be based on the team you work for and where your territory is located. My territory was new in part and located 2.5 hours from our warehouse. I did not receive the Manager or Office support that others did.
good,Sysco is a very large company with a fast-paced culture. It wasn't a family-focused as I was a custom to. The company that I worked for before they were bought out operated much differently.
good,"Sysco is a place where you can have some longevity. However, because of people staying in the positions so long, it is hard to move up. The diversity in my particular department in management is non existent. The salary was not commensable with my experience. I do like the people but I need the finances. Also, you only get one week of vacation your first year.Yolu also get one week of sick every year and it does not roll over and 3 Sysco days."
good,Use to be a great place to work but not anymore human part equation was taking out. Understandably it's about the bottom line dollar but I don't think they care about their people anymore
good,I worked for almost 16 years and the first 7 were absolutely outstanding.  With a combination of declining restaurants and compensation it became a very stressful place to work.
good,"Sysco is a great place to work for the money and benefits, but they lack a team atmosphere, are constantly pushing new sales initiatives  and programs to keep the stock price up and say that they are customer first, but really do not care about their customers at all."
good,Is a fast paced environment which is updating itself. New programs and processes are being introduced on a regular basis and a person needs to adapt quickly.
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to manage my own sales territory. Income opportunities were unlimited. "
good,"Union job, but the union is in bed with management.  They really do nothing at all but negotiate contract.  Recently lost huge Tim Horton acct to another company and layed a ton of us off and closed a warehouse over one acct.  Wish they had opted to keep people on and look for another acct to replace it.  If management wants to get rid of you they do so on stupid technicalities."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Come in and grab your equipment, Select for 10-12 hours with a 30 min lunch,  run over 100%, 0 Errors. Senior Selectors help a lot if you play your cards right and show you can move. Save your Money!"
good,"It was an extremely tolling job, made more so by the overnight schedule. The job paid very well, but a certain level of job proficiency was expected very quickly. Would recommend for the pay, little else though."
good,"I was making decent money and working 12-14 hour days. The loads would be consistently loaded wrong. Stop 1 being on the bottom of the pallet, etc. Management was ok. Not a bad place to work if you don't mind long days."
good,Overly hard work. It's a two-man job but only one man is doing it. Some of the supervisors are kiddish with overbearing Egos. Supplies to do the job correctly and effective are scarce.
good,We won haul of fame several years in a row. set new standards for accountability and set up new pay scales based on performances. This job exp was off the charts . I handled everything from inventories to account payable's to receivables. productions and schedules on night crews. Trained and hired employees as needed. Team work building and accountability from all departments.
good,"Good old boys club, It's all about who you are in bed with. Sysco's size is a blessing and a curse. Large broker community at your finger tip, however products are price above market which ca be problematic in competitive situation"
good,Stable company eith decent benefits. No opportunity to get promotion or to move to another shift. Good pay. Good location. Shift hours are a little much when working in the freezer.
good,The company gave me the opportunity to enter into the sales side of foodservice after having a chef career.  They had very good training and good products to sell.
good,"Many wrong decisions have been made costing the company tons of money, so now to try and offset the loses they did a 2% workforce reduction. So many of the benefits have all been taken away.  Health insurance is not cheap. Heavy stress in all departments.  Pay is not competitive if you work in the office they do pay the drivers very well."
good,Expectations are high but good experience. Most everyone is nice to work with. Hardest part of job is staying on top of everything that is expected.
good,Sysco is a great company to work for but for the sales side it is stressful because you are always competing with previous years numbers regardless if you had the business the previous year - you make your numbers and your safe but if you don't make your numbers regardless the reason you are dismissed - sales side you are only a number to Sysco.
good,"My day started ad 6 am with answer emails, work on emergencies that need immediate attention. I have learned how to prioritize the work, learned about different culture. To believe in my work and stand 100% behind it. Working with the co-workers that have the same believes as you have make it more fun to work in a team together and easier to help each other and push each other. The hardest part of the job was to handle an already full plate that grew almost weekly."
good,2nd into 3rd shift....Long hrs and little to no home life. if you are single this is the job for you. if not then I would move along.
good,"A lot of hard working people work at Sysco who truly want to do a great job.  The majority of the management team has no idea how to increase morale.  Let people who have worked an number of hours leave early once in a while and allow exempt employees some time off when they come in to work on a Saturday, it makes for a LONG week when you have to work 6 days a week to attend and work an employee event which really has noting with completing your job duties and yes the event is REQUIRED, however, some favorites get to skip the events while the rest of the us work,  Being friends with your VP certainly helps with ""special treatment:."
good,"Very much enjoy working here, being a great experience, flexible hours, not a 9 to 5 job. met some incredible people who will be life long friends. Middle management is difficult to deal with, because great MAs don't take the DSM job because quite often it's a pay cut to take a promotion."
good,"Sysco works hard to create a positive enriching work environment, however there is little to no training for lower to middle management.  These managers are often promoted as a next step in their career but lack the necessary skills to lead a team to excellence.  "
good,Good company with lots of opportunities. Has added some new leadership in I.T. that has a different perspective on how to stay on top.
good,"Sysco is a very attractive employer with good benefits and stability.  Marketing Associates should have experience in hospitality or culinary operations.  First year pay is respectable and commission program is very complex."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Only Looking for a different work for 1 reason my first child is on the way.I really like working here because i get to come home ever night and the guys are easy going,but soon it will only be myself working and i will not be able to cover all the bills with this job.job. I'm not getting full work weeks,and really need the money"
good,Decent place to work that was close to home. The people for the most part were great to work with. The atmosphere was friendly and the work life balance was ok.
good,A productive and safe environment. But needs better management. The new union is okay but not understanding to everyone needs and issues.
good,"Management makes you feel unappreciated as an employee, as if you are not an asset to the company. Company was very unorganized, lacked strong management personal, and was not a team player environment."
good,"Working on a self motivation, has been very good in learning to push youselft  to do the work faster and better then others. management has treated me with respect. the hardest is slowing down and knowing i could have done more"
good,"Incredible company to work for however downsizing hindered job security greatly."
good,"Work at your own pace... fast"
good,"A typical day at Sysco North Texas is basically covering your assets. If you have the experience when you start with the company the only thing there is left to do is take the computer courses to enhance your skills and possibly learn something new to take to your next job. "
good,Sales team was great and supportive.  Built new product lines to $3.8M annual sales. built great customer relationships
good,good money long hard hours well manged and understanding staff good clean work environment
good,"is a good company, is just some of their policies doesn't make any sense."
good,"Great training program & comprehensive benefits. Sales is all about obtaining new business which is the lifeblood of the corporation with regards to sales. Depending on the market, territory and competition surrounding you sales can be lucrative."
good,"Great place to work, with great incentives and pay. Benefits were outstanding."
good,"Elitist attitude by Management, Micro Management"
good,Loved it day to day I was busy from time in the door till time out. Picking orders management was kind and would work with you on questions and concerns you had.
good,"update laptop @ 0630 with sales program and market mover program. Go thru accounts that will be seen today. Run off accounts specials sheet (specific to account) and accounting report to pick up monies due. Meet first account normally about 0900 (depending on day) with last account seen about 1600. When with account input order, transmit to insure all items allocate for sale. Ask probing questions to generate the following weeks special sheet. When I get home I bring up 360 sales tool and input notes for the day. I scan checks collected during the day. Wait until routing comes thru at or about 2100 hour and then leave message for customer (depending) on what time truck is routed for delivery."
good,A typical work day is a constant race to stay ahead of the order selectors by replenishing product before they need it. I learned to be successful you must stay focused and help others. The team is only as strong as its weakest link.The management needs improvement in several areas. The co workers are a diverse group personality wise and you just have to focus on your job to be successful. The hardest part of the job is the hours of the shift and the number of hours you spend at the facility. The most enjoyable part is by far the paycheck as Sysco pays far better than anywhere else for the same job.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Hard work pay good "
good,They care more about hitting numbers than making sure you succeed.  No support from upper management. The division president only cares about making his bonus.
good,Sysco international was good employer to work for but the warehouse got outgrown needed bigger facility. Some of the management needed to be replaced would of made it a lot better
good,"Sysco Cleveland is a great sales job as long as you are beating your numbers from last year. As in most B2B hunter sales positions, new business is EVERYTHING. If you have contacts in the industry and you can learn their systems quickly you will do well for a few years. Most successful sales associates move up or out after proving themselves on the street. It’s a 6 day grind. Lots of pieces."
good,"Sysco has helped me advance my skills and knkowledge in the workplace, just feel wore out from the overnight shift, and i am seeking a change in pace."
good,All about the pay...if you don't like working loooong hours at night then don't bother...top pay. They feed you sandwiches but a hot meal one day a week. It's extremely hard so you've been warned.
good,Able to work remote when I had to move.  Decent benefits. Work can be fun and interesting. Always more to learn. New processes are sometimes implemented too quickly without proper instruction.
good,If u want to work hard and physically this the job. It has great health benefits for you and family. You work for 4 days at 1st and then they will start focusing you on 5th day .
good,"Great pay. Tyrannical management. Long hours every week. Extremely hard. Arguably the hardest warehouse you can work at. The proof is in the high turn over rate, and all the new employees that come here saying they’ve never experienced work like this before in the warehouses they’ve worked at. Or it’s the same work but 5x the amount"
good,Responsible for selection and loading of food items. Shifts were over 12 hours long. Good training but not enough man power for the amount of work required.
good,They changed Management in my area and he played favorites and was not fair to others.  I loved it until he came and pretty much ruined my career.  I finally saw it wasn't getting better so i had to leave for my sanity.
good,"Satisfactory work environment when I was there, as with any job, it depends on your necessities for employment. Being that I am no longer there, I cannot speak on things as of now."
good,typical work day included answering phones emails and assisting client with gaining access to their designated areas. It was a very slowed paced working environment
good,"Well paid but managements new ideas dont go over well. Union job that the union doesnt really stand up for workers. Hard work, hard on the body"
good,"Unfortunately as good as it was to get a job with Sysco, it was not a place that was for me in almost every aspect.  It was hard to adapt to culture of the work place."
good,"Sysco was a typical job. Not much advancement or movement into the company. I was more a guy who could do both sides of the logistics inside sysco i maneuvered well within the company. As per it being a place for advancement, it wasn’t."
good,I worked nights Sunday to Thursday night with overtime my night would start at 530pm and I would stay most nights to 4am or later all in all compensation was the best part they were alittle strict on some minor things but always trying to better themselves
good,You get paid really well. The harder you work the more you get paid. The hours are long. No lunch breaks. Co-workers are easy going. Training is awful. Management don't communicate well.
good,Wake up at 3:00 in the morning and start throwing boxes. First couple stops are usually the bottom of the pallet. You'd have to touch everything and wheel food in. All the public schools where the worst because you have to do five or six of them before 11:00 a.m.. and then you'd have to do all the restaurants.  the convalescent homes were sucked too because you have to park a half mile away and wheel the stuff in.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"I was lucky when I worked at Sysco. My direct supervisor was an ex-driver that was newly promoted. He was still trying to find his way in the management realm, but wasn't quite there yet. He related more with drivers, than he did management, which made my job easier."
good,"It was a good training for other distributors but you were just a ""what have you done lately for me"" mentality. Good 'ol boy network when trying to advance."
good,Work days start as early as 3am sometime 2. Preloaded trailer has to be unloaded by driver at multiple locations-sometime as many as 12. Scanner is provided to ensure the driver is delivering the right product. Trailer can be loaded up to 1200 cases. If luck some of which would be skid drops. If you don't mind physical labor and early morning then this is the job for you.
good,"Overall a good company, leadership can change quickly and can be inconsistent from one to another. "
good,"Hard, fast paced job. Very stressful but good benefits. Management never sees eye to eye with employees. If you can get passed that: sysco is a big company.  Some employees don't agree with the workhouse environment and work there for the benefits. (Especially those that have large families) But if you don't mind hard work it could be the job for you."
good,This is a corporate based business meaning they are looking out for the bottom line and share holders first. Good growth opportunities with average salary's. Training is good.
good,Had to open nee accounts on continuous basis 100% commission  Ne reimbursement for any expenses.  Promoted with in company provided laptop for job benefits were excellent manager was always available
good,"Behind the competition when it comes to benefits, particularly related to vacation time, maternity/paternity leave, and flexible work hours. "
good,Sysco Seattle has great people to work with.
good,"There is some problem to communicate between employer and employee. Only that is problem in Syscon. When some employee present his opinion and correction report, CEO hate to hear this report."
good,I like working there it help me pay my bills manager pretty cool I just need more money so I can pay bill I will recommend people if they need a job come to Sysco
good,"Micromanaged from above so everything you're doing is being monitored and recorded."
good,"Sysco pays great and their benefits package is through the roof but for me the work life and home life balance was way too off for me. I don't mind working the hours but the start time was usually really early in the morning until well in the evening and you were given just enough time to go home , shower, and eat some dinner and a few hours of sleep before you were scheduled to return to work . That coupled with the level of work required  being driving , lifting , unloading all products by hand was too much for me ."
good,"An active day to day work load. Very nice people, that are willing to help and work with you. The work load was simple and consistent. The systems they use are easy to operate and the information presented by them are easily explained and simple to understand."
good,"Not so friendly staff, supervisor was helpful only worked there for 3 months. Was told I was working for a lady that went out on maternity leave. Once she was return my assignment was over."
good,"Things on the transportation side started out great then the director left and cleaned the place out of good people, that area became a train wreck at that point. I was hired to do a job on the fleet side but my boss wouldn't let me do it because he was friends with a few of the mechanics. He had the tail wagging the dog"
good,This company was okay. benefits were good and the pay was average. large corporate sheep environment. Okay for some but not all. Management was very poor.
good,"In the normal course of business I was able to meet with a variety of chefs and discuss, develop ideas for new menu items, costs controls, new product ideas."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,I enjoyed working at SYSCO. The only challenge was the support system was never implemented . Decent communication throughout the company. Could offer more field training then given.
good,it sound very interesting at the beginning but lack credibility within the top managers.. flexible place to work and very hard to understand workers as everyone tend to be pretentious and hypocrite to new employee
good,Sysco delivery drivers can work long hours. Overall great company to work for but can be very demanding with family life. Work hours change every week with only only set day off.
good,long hours don't have much of a family life. other than that you have a chance to make a ton pf money if you can hit the incentive. but for me that doesn't make up for lost family time
good,"sysco food is very good for a person looking to go in and work independently getting your job done and going home. very competitive wages, but have to be prepared to work the hours."
good,"Management and policies change constantly in the past few years.  Employee Benefit has been reduced in the pass few years."
good,Sysco is a great company to work for. The benefits are great and the 401k plan is like no other. You are going to work alot of hours. The pay is pretty good
good,Regarding the seafood category - Sysco has a lot to learn and will adjust over time.  The understanding of demographics and each Opco's footprint is essential.
good,"Very corporate, but not a bad company.  Good place to learn sales if not really experienced.  Have to show initiative and good people skills, organization, etc."
good,Working with people who only ever will make 10 hr. while you make 16hr. Because of citizenship can be hard for all the workers here. But it still goes on with a us against them mentally.
good,Sysco was one of the most challenging companies I worked for. The workplace culture was one of low moral. The focus was on company margins and many times not in the best interest of customers. While I earned a good living at times it became difficult to go work some days.
good,No tips Sysco was a fast paced warehouse were the oppurtunity is there but the pay does not add up with the work load and there is no job security for the job.
good,It paid very well but the managment sucked and the co workers were not welcoming and had alot of attitude ...the warehouse was just under horrible managment.
good,"Como el gran mayoria de las empresas....siempre hay personas, que hacen un mal ambiente laboral."
good,Working here you are an extension of the machines. If your not working as hard as the line is pumping your not working up to pace. Have to be fit and ready for a challenge.
good,"It was a good expierence working in different environments such as dry, cooler, and freezer. Very competitive work. Would have been better if company provided better freezer jackets."
good,"Sysco Business Services is a great place to work, specifically accounting/payroll, if you are fast. Hitting deadlines is most important. Accuracy is second. Technology, software/hardware and IT issues are a constant challenge. Pay and benefits are decent."
good,"It is an overall nice place to work, if you don’t mind the cold. The management is very involved and likes to ensure it’s customer satisfaction. Although there are some hiccups in the system, they are on a person to person belief."
good,"busy busy place.  keep your cool and you will do fine.  listen and learn, once you are out and about things get more comfortable.  be yourself you will be fine"
good,"Create New Business and Maintaining current business"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"A typical day was getting in the car and calling on accounts."
good,"The company allows bullying by other employees and management will participate by trying to push out a good employee who meets all metrics, minds their own business and comes to work on time.  "
good,Not a bad place to work but home time is the sacrifice for advancement. Good people but will require some get used to if you are not.  Overall decent place to work.
good,"Sysco was a great opportunity to work in a large scale environment within the Food and Beverage industry. A fast paced environment where I strengthened my decision-making skills, communication, and teamwork."
good,Sysco is a stable company that offers benefits but the pay is not competitive. Hard to advance within the organization. Sometimes advancement depends upon who you know and not your skills.
good,Sysco foods of chicago is in des plaines.  Sysco foods is a heavy labor job in the warehouse it has 3 departments dry cooler and freezer.  You can make descent money there.
good,Sysco is diving deeper into the ecommerce world. This transistion is causing uncertainty about what role sales people will have in the future. The sale position is now an entry level job that someone should only stay at for 5 years or less. It use to be something a person could strive for as a career.
good,"Great company, crazy customers, never a dull moment or an average day. They are the leaders in transportation and delivery. Deliveries are timely and complete."
good,Pressure needs to be on what restaurants really need rather than the products and initiatives that only fit a few to be a better partner in the industry.
good,There is a transition period happening currently with a new sales coverage model mirroring what US Foods has done 5 years prior. Unfortunately we are concerned more about margin than case growth as the restaurant landscape has dictated
good,I enjoyed my time with Sysco. Unfortunately it was at a time when there were restaurants closing daily and there just wasn't enough to go around for the new people that had recently joined the sales team.
good,"no work life balance...customers call you non stop. they only way you make money is by screwing customers.  Not the best job in the world, but its not the worst either.  there is no commentary"
good,Less career growth opportunity but got lot of learning experience. Not a competitive pay and benefits. Overall a good place to work. Work/life can be balanced.
good,Great place to work. People from all walks of life. Great workers no supervisors. Can be stressful at end of quarters but not more so than any other distribution company.
good,"Nice people"
good,"Good company. "
good,"Everyday work was productive, the culture was diverse and exiting, management treated employees fairly. It was definitely a learning process interacting with so many different people."
good,"Wasn't there long enough to make a good judgement call.  "
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Great pay and benefits. No room for advancement, or ability to change shifts.  Night shifts is primarily the only shift you can get when applying for the job."
good,Good experience for individuals who do not mind a climate control atmospheres. The workplace and facilities are good for the flow of traffic so they can maintain a balanced work safety environment.
good,"Not exciting, but a solid company.  Changing management has made it not the same company it was built on.  Sound company, but hard to see where opportunity is."
good,This was a good place for me to come and learn the basics of my job. The people where great and the management was ok. The only thing I didn't like was the fact they would work you half way to death and they outsourced almost all the positions that would pay well.
good,"Sysco is a great place to work but there was not much job security there. I would encourage Marketing people to apply."
good,just very unorganized now and are going through changes in the logistics department. good work place and great friendly people to work with and good benefits.
good,Fair compensation. Benefits are lacking. Need to be able to relocate to progress into management. Large turnover in staff. Food is a tough business to get into. Sales reps can make good money if motivated.
good,"Long hours, with little to no family life"
good,"You need to thrive to be the best by being highly productive and innovative about what you to. In simple you need to work smart than hard. "
good,good money hard work freindly atmosphere ok supervisors human resources are pretty good at handling things like vacations sick time the work is very hard
good,"To secure a long-term position within an organization in which my talents can be used to attain our mutual goals."
good,"Great Experience, highly motivating work, extremely competitive. I'd recommend working for Sysco, just make sure you fully understand the what they expect of you. Weigh that against your personal life and forget your personal life and that's your answer."
good,The benefits are great. the days are long and I miss out on a lot of my personal life because of the hours. The employees are great and I had a pretty understanding boss
good,Working as a delivery driver required a lot of long hours and not much direction. Warehouse associates were not held accountable for the way they loaded trucks which made some deliveries longer than needed due to the fact you had to dig for product. Management played favorites and if you upset someone your daily routes would be cut and given away.
good,It was an okay job but definitely not a job for a student who hasn't has much experience in the janitorial field. I learned how to clean things properly though something I might not have learned if i hadn't taken the job
good,"Intense and focused are the two words that describe a must to work here, having a memory like an elephant and the temperment of a lion. Patient and agile"
good,"Very fast paced job , tight schedules high expectations for great customer satisfaction. Very early days usually starting at 2am going until 1or 2pm ."
good,"*Responsible for general duties involving the physical handling of product, materials, supplies and equipment. Operating industrial power equipment, restocking and replenishing when appropriate, performing general maintenance and ensuring compliance with regulatory and company policies and procedures. I also covered other positions as needed performing general warehouse/production/cooler and freezer service duties. Excessive bending, kneeling, lifting 50+ lbs, and climbing."
good,"Being A sale associate was not for me."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Decent  workers that made it nice. Manager was alrigh set emed to care about the workers.  Tried to be concerned about what was going on.  A few months before I left it seemed to be that he had trust issues with me not sure why.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance - satisfactory"
good,"As a Supervisor you are given a group of drivers to watch over, you need to train them on delivery methods, speed, where to park, you need a Class A CDL to be a Supervisor and you will be on the road/field a lot but also work at the Operation Center, long hours."
good,The company culture is a little hard to understand but the benefits are great.  Working there was quite a learning experience on so many levels.  Lots of employees have moved up through the ranks and are in positions that they are not really qualified for.
good,safe work place nice atmospere overtime i liked woking in the cold storage i worked for Best loading as a lumper at sysco before moving out to california .I may apply soon
good,"physical work keeps you busy makes your day go by fast.  environment changes from cool, dry, freezer on where you will be working but overall good place good pay hours are decent"
good,There schedules are consistent but with large volume fluctuations. The people were good but the culture changed dramatically over time. The hardest part of the job was the amount of physical labor involved. You have find and dig out every piece of product and deliver by hand.
good,Loved working at Sysco foods. the best. I only lived 5minutes away from work so I love the travel time . the hours of service was great as well . Start time is at 2:30 a.m  M-Sat. all Sundays off.
good,typical days are like 10-13 hour days. have to maintain a 90% daily performance and 100% weekly which makes no sense.  management is not very good no structure
good,"Sysco overall is a good place to work. However, the work is challenging and very demanding. If you handle stress well, it can be a place to learn new things and gain a better understanding of food distribution. I learned many things such as time management, deadline completion, and tips for efficiency. I enjoy the challenging work days. Although, I think the company asks for too much from the employees in one work day. Not many can complete the daily tasks due to cuts and overwhelming workload. At least, this is the case in my department."
good,"learned a new way of ordering which I had not done before, new experiences are always good -- sometime very stressful but learned to multi-task in several different ways which will help in future work places"
good,"In and out of a freezer all day long putting up product in very cold temps , it would be about 13 degrees below zero and not enough reg ignition."
good,Long work nights for selector. A constant pressure to increase production because of dipluted crew. Tight work areas and sub freezing tempartures. Only upside was the possibility to make 37.50.
good,If you work 60 hrs a week you can make good money. The management here is very hostile towards drivers they want you as close to 70 hrs a week as possible or they aren't happy even if you do your route for the week they still look down on you if you don't work Saturday's. They don't care if you have family. Their incentive pay is a joke.
good,"great benefits"
good,"not bad, management is great. Learned to work with rf scanners, training is great. Co-workers were good to work with. hardest part was being away most of the time from family during the days."
good,Company doing great things--implementing new systems and processes to support the continued growth.  Takes stock in developing talent for future opportunities.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Never know when your are going to work until the night before.  Might start work anywhere between 0200-0600. But are unsure untill 1900 the day prior. Forget about lunch breaks, those are only taken while driving from one location to another."
good,It's hard work but you make real good money as long as you don't mind working for it. You get home most the time unless they stick u on a over night. So if you have young kids you want be with them every night.
good,You will make lots of money as a driver for sysco working 50-60 hours a week 12-14 hours a day. It is extremely hard and stressful so you will need thick skin to succeed. It can be done but its certainly not for everyone.
good,"Every house will vary in regards to loads, routes, treatment of drivers.  Work is physical and requires patience when dealing with customers and with the load itself."
good,the job is okay not bad okay pay not  bad benefits keeps you with work long as you come on time  company discounts good good good
good,You typically work 10-14 hrs. a days. Management Is okay. Good co workers. Unloading the truck with a lot of cases and a lot of stops. The end of day was the most enjoyable.
good,great paying job. Very good management and supervising team. great company overall but and i prefer a forklift there i drive a 3 leg pallet jack. hardest part of the job is the standards employees have to meet.
good,"Working here can be fun, everyone is supportive of each other."
good,Sysco is a challenging and fast-paced work environment with a steep learning curve.  The skills I have learned have made me an asset.
good,"I found it hard to resign from the organization. But the company is not providing the exact salary or salary benefits what she offered. I love my job and interested to work for the organisation at any cost but my family hood also a matter of concern. Interesting job, good coworkers and high officials. Learned many things like how to improve efficiency, how to save time etc."
good,Sysco is a fast pace environment.  Must be able to multi-task.  Friendly environment.  Sysco does not offer much in the way of training and advancing growth.
good,See the previous post for a good overview of the type of company your dealing with. Just filling up space to have enough to get out of this required review.

good,"Great Company to work for. Driven for results, and creatively creates new initiatives to help drive business growth. Would prefer to see a more structured selling method."

good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"My position was created to develop school business.  I didn't have a job description and the goal was to secure school bids.  I was able to secure 20, which was double the goal. It was a great learning experience, but we didn't have much success.  Once the business was secured we weren't able to coordinate all of the departments in time to satisfy the schools as far as delivery time, commodity draw down, inventory, marketing, merchandising, pricing, billing and customer service.  Our website wasn't user friendly either.  We were in the midst of a merger and consequently my position was eliminated."
good,"typical day at work just continues order pick ups ,i learned to be totally organized, mangement wise is pretty fair, my co-workers are awesome, difficult part of the job is when we get difficult orders with lots of quantity  like about 50 or more of the same product with the weight of 50pnds and you have to do it in like 2-5 mins.the most enjoyable is when work is done."
good,"the drivers had delivery windows they had to meet no matter what... the loaders had to make sure everything was loaded no matter what..."

good,"Got skills to work under pressure and managed to master sales techniques in Dubai and CIS countries!"

Check the Customer Service email & voice mail, process all orders and requests from sales people and customers. Confirm all orders with both customers and sales people via phone or email. Open our Task Manager and check for new sample requests. Enter new sample requests and email brokers, vendors, and Marketing Associates to confirm their requests. Check the Customer Service inbox throughout the day to complete and process all requests."
good,It was a great job in the beginning until they started hiring inexperienced and lazy workers. This caused the experienced employees to work more and carry all the weight. It got worse as the years went on.
good,"Sysco, is a fast paced environment.  On a typical day I was in front of 5-8 different existing or prospect customers. We were resposible to retain and grow our existing customers case count.  New sales were key."

good,"Average workplace. Much transition and changes in Management. Transition to an SAP environment delayed."
good,"Each day was met as a fast pace jumping to what was needed at the moment. Keying orders for vendors, sales team members and brokers. "
good,"If your considering Sysco Corporation as your next move you should consider that this is an ever changing organization.  Opportunities for learning are good and trending better.  Advancement opportunities are available but dependent on pedigree, perception, exposure, and performance."
good,when i first started at sysco it was some in the atmosphere that made u want to come to work from the coworkers to supervisor and manger sysco is a company that will help u out long as u get the job done right they will look out for u
good,Decent environment with a fast paced work day.  Must be on your toes all day to deal with multiple issues.  Must be able to learn as you go as training is hard to come by.  Nice to be always busy all day makes the days go by faster.
good,"the union part about it is you have to wait until people retire to get it otherwise you pay dues with out having the benefits the only good benefits I like about the job, is they offer free ham, turkey during the holidays and have the option to donate it to families in need. The other is overtime is paid by the 8 hour shift, so anything over 8 hours is overtime for that day."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,This job can be very stressful to most it is very hard physically and mentally. Delivering the product is the hardest part according to your route. The hardest part about this job is the physical work but the best thing about it is how they compensate you.
good,Dealing with the customers and having a good personal relationship with customers. Being out on on the road is like being your own boss.
good,Good starting career opportunity. Provides good customer relationship building experience. Also provides good experience in self management and discipline.

good,learn so much great coworkers daily task consist of enter invoices reconciling gl accounts summiting claims to corp sorting mail
good,Solid place to work. Trailers would be cude out on a 28ft trailer. very long days. management didnt care too much about drivers unless you were their pet.
good,Training is VERY lacking. Most positions within the company you are on your own when it comes to learning your job. Employee recognition is scarce. On a good note there is room for advancement within the company and great benefits.
good,"nice place to work, human resources can use some schooling on how to handle issues when conflicts arise and what to say and not to say to people."
good,"Order entry, up selling to better brands, and dealing with restaurant owners most of the day.  Downfall was collecting money and dealing with ever changing management team."
good,Fast pace busy schedule. Work about 90 hours per week.  Great compensation if you work hard.  Large turn over rate in management.  No expenses are taken care of.
good,"A typical day requires you to be able to adapt to changing conditions.I have learned working at Sysco that the food industry can be as challenging as any industry."
good,Picking and stacking items on a pallet to the batches was complete. I learned that with good teamwork you can get the job complete. My co-workers are great people which became family. The hardest part of the job was the hours cause you definitely will miss your family. What I enjoyed the most besides the pay was the laughs I have with co-workers and quitting time so I can get to the reason I work so hard and that's my family.
good,"Sysco as a company is great but the management is horrible. The hardest part of your day is not unloading the truck its having to deal with the them. People wonder why they have such a high turn over rate and it is because the management. They give away loads to other drivers that they buddy buddy with and then when drivers come in they just tell them "" your route been cut"", which is a load of b.s. On the average you will get there at 3-4 a.m. and then you might sit until 7-10 in the morning waiting to get a load or until they just tell you go home. They don't have enough equipment for the the drivers so even if you get there early enough to get a tractor, scanner, and hand truck you might have to turn around and give it to a driver who has a load, and then IF you get a load they have to cut another driver lock and chain to get more equipment, which needless to say when that driver comes to work they wondering "" where is my equipment"". Overall until they get better management for the drivers its just going to be one big revolving door."
good,"worked for dairy, produce and meat buyers for Sysco in san diego. managed shipment and tracked deliveries as alternate transportation manager. assisted buyers in meetings with local producers and worked with diary to lock in pricing on products."

good,"Former employer hitting 60-70 plus if you don't mind working 6 days a week and hitting 18-20 stops a day and making $80,000 plus a year then this job is perfect for you my 1st year at sysco as a delivery driver I hit $96,000 but it wasn't easy"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"A challenging evironment, vendor and customer focused company."
good,"It was a really great place to work, with great co-workers and environment. Couldn't trust upper management, and in the end, they sold all of us out. They outsourced to India, and then couldn't figure out why the quality of work went downhill fast."
good,Sysco is a good company if you are selling to large accounts.  If you have a bunch of smaller accounts they are treated with less regard for service levels.
good,"Accounts Payables Associate"
good,Traveling from different customers for their food orders. Worked alone and met a lot of new people.
good,"busy"
good,when 911 happen a lot of my sales accounts went out of Business

good,"Must adapt to change, Sysco is changing their process to become One Sysco. "
good,Great company to work for.  Great benefits and great pay.  You must work fast and be accurate.  The work is hard but pays off if you can handle it.
good,Sysco is a fun place to work with people from every background and walk of life. We all share the common goal of satisfying our customers with the best of service.
good,I learned alot about the inner-workings of a Fortune 50 Company.
good,old fashion company. overall is a good company to work for.  strict hours 8-5 with 1 hour lunch break.
good,"A typical  day at work includes handling customer service related issues, driver related issues, assuring on time delivery of products, interviewing potential employees, managing drivers and supervisors."
good,"Not applicable to my career."
good,"Enhanced my internal skills working with Sales department.   Management is supportive of daily task, and co-worker's work together to complete tasks."
good,"Hardest part of the job is that everything falls back on you, you make the wheels spin and you are the target for both good and bad outcomes. Vacation is never really vacation, phone is constantly ringing off the hook. High expectations, lots of changes, little reward. Not the ideal career for people with family life."
good,Great job if your single and have no kids. Very physical. Great pay.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,In charge of Shipping and Receiving. Employee training. Employee discipline and rewards programs.
good,"Restaurant food sales and consulting.  "
good,Best part of the job was the pay. Routing never looked at a map and the warehouse needed a lot more practice.
good,"Establishes relationships with SBS vendors;	purchasing for SBS and Sysco Dallas (i.e., office supplies, mailroom supplies, break room items, building maintenance items, software licenses, etc…); researches invoice discrepancies for resolution; request quotes from vendors; continuously improving purchasing and new hire  processes; manage inventories and utility spreadsheet, including a pivot table for easy look-up; provides spreadsheet to HR, and one to SBS's Sr. VP; processes incoming New Hire’s; manages and creates SBS badges and badge processes. "

good,Managing the distribution of products to my territory customers along with continuously growing new business and penetrating current.
good,"The Food Service Industry is the largest & fastest growing industry in the Country. It is projected to grow 4.7% to 342 Billion Dollars! It is a very exciting industry that is packed with new experiences everyday. There is never a dull moment, everyday you find yourself fighting to manage your business & fighting to steal your competition's business."
good,Sorted and prepared mortgage loans
good,Cold Calls/Account Management/B2B Sales/Consultative Selling
good,The job was very hands on and involved safety first. The hardest thing about the job that it was mandatory overtime every night.
good,"Lacked friendliness, uptight work environment, not very helpful when came to answering questions."
good,"A day at work included checking in with the dispatcher to get paperwork on orders to be selected, then to get orders pulled in a timely manner to maintain production level, operate various forklifts, maintain inventory levels and load trucks and deliver to customers."
good,"Good people to work with, great products and a huge commitment to customer satisfaction."
good,"eight to twelve hour work days. ive learned how to identify, stack and ship items with high accuracy. management was excellent. co-workers helped out even though incentive based. the hardest parts where the long nights in the freezer then switching to another department to help finish shipping. the most enjoyable part was clocking out after a hard days work."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"fast paced work , very physical, upper management was very in tune with entry level people and seemed to care about all employees by knowing their first name and were friendly to all."
good,Sysco Food Services of San Diego was a challenging company to work for because of the management in place. Management seemed disconnected from the rest of the staff and communication from the top down needed some work.
good,"My responsibilities in my job are to make sure the product leaves the building in perfect conditions, take temperatures, weights of the product and make sure the employees are working safely."
good,Great job for great pay management isn't up to par but the money makes up for it you will deal with more and get paid less the culture  is slave like seen and not heard but again the pay is excellent
good,Pulling orders in the freezer was hard and cold and eventually gets the better of you.  It is a good company but lacks good management and supervisors.
good,Overall good place to work. international company. several locations around the world. opportunity for advancement. good culture. diverse community overall.
good,Company is pretty good but recently gave us all these great numbers and then the next day we had layoffs.   I didn’t like the way they handled that really in professional.
good,"Horaires difficiles, temps supplémentaire obligatoire. Bonne paye. Employés sympatique."
good,If you’re looking to make some money go for it. The teamster Benefits and pay are solid. The overtime is there. But it could be way better if they learned to have fun. They focus way to much on production then how their actual hardworking employees are doing. They should learn that management needs to get reviewed just as much as the drivers are watched. Reverse pyramid would help this company but they probably could care less.
good,Sysco is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. You are always welcomed to return as most do from my experience. Sysco is all over the world and is a large company but currently they are struggling with AMAZON's GLOBAL Conveniences for the consumer. More layoffs than ever due to logistics/trucking mostly.
good,"it's okay to work at Sysco. Competitive and fast paced atmosphere. Would recommend to those that are strong willed, driven, and business minded. Other than that... You judge for yourself..."
good,"Great support team "
good,"They have a inner core of younger, capable worker who are their own group."
good,"This company preaches that customers and employees are #1. But actions speak louder than words. It comes down to the bottom line and meeting Sales Plans, no matter who they hurt along the way. We are all just numbers. Plus, with the recent push of e-commerce, computers will be replacing majority of the workforce very soon."
good,Great people but long hours. Worked with great people that really tried hard to perform there job to the best of their abilities. Most employees work an average of 10 hours a day.
good,"this was a very technical and service oriented business, there was very little customer loyalty and the company was very rigid in product demands and pricing,"
good,"SBS is a very good place to work.  I learned a lot about working in a large organization with many departments and entities.  It has a very collaborative culture and a healthy mix of fast-paced, transactional accounting; and slower, research-based process improvement."
good,"Good benefits, great facilities, management is not aligned, which makes it hard to deliver to value proposition. No clear lines of responsibility, change in direction every 6 month"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Good job with high pay, benefits, etc but physically demanding, they put new drivers on a different route each day where driver needs to know where to park semi, what door to enter, where to put order... 26,000 lbs of food delivered by hand, with truck driving between each stop is hard work"
good,"Working for SYSCO has been challenging in many different ways that I enjoyed in an everyday basis. SYSCO gave me a chance to learn many different ways of performing my work the best way possible in which I learned to drive safely, communicate with people, and altogether to grow as a human being."
good,Decent job if no kids or kids is grown. The pay is good plenty overtime. . Good schedule most likely to get consecutive days off. Busy season you will get forced in on your off days. Everything I seniority based.
good,Sysco Foods is a great company to work for if your looking to establish a career. Working as an outbound selector was a very hard and fast pace work enviorment and consisted of wearing a scanner and printer and going up and down the warehouse isles scanning and pulling customer orders in a timely manner to reach the loading dock in time for the trucks to be loaded to ship to the customers on time.
good,very difficult but pays well. good job for the young. i dont feel its a job to get in your later years. the physical demand is crazy. but if your healthy and strong go for it.
good,Sysco used to be a good place to work but became too consumed with micro managing.  A vast majority of seasoned veterans have left to look for work elsewhere because the current work environment became too stressful to be worth twice the $$.  Poor management decisions placed undue stress on the sales team.
good,"account management"
good,"Work in Trans and WH definitely a product of who is at the top of the pile. Can be a very good place to work though a bit heavy on the rules and regulations area. With most recent management changes there seems to be more of a focus on being friends with employees but as has always been the case, the honeymoon will be over and hopefully they can get back to doing the job right. Entirely too many games played with no explanation of the rules of the game or even knowing what the game is. Other than pet peeves however, it is a good place to work with good pay and benefits."
good,"I was able to learn a lot of information about food, and products used by chefs and owners. I really enjoyed being able to use my qualities to sell and assist customers on a weekly basis. I did not like the size of Sysco and felt they were way too competitive and did not make time for the little restaurant who was just trying to make ends meat."
good,"not the same company I started with 3 years ago, being run by shareholders and CPA's. Sales force has been lost in the shuffle with less time to sell and more emphasis on administrative duties"
good,"As a marketing associate you expense your own car and cell phone. In an outside sales position You write your own schedule. If you don't want to leave your house then expect to not grow. "
good,Very hard work and very physical. Loads are very inefficient. You always have to break down pallets to find what you need. Company is very dysfunctional.
good,"Visit current customers and create new customers."
good,"A day at work for Sysco is usually great as we go in, load our truck and head out for the day to do our deliveries. Things get hectic and disorganized at times which cause stress and makes you irritated."
good,a lot of movement long nights learned how to use a pallet jack and how to stack cases For the route drivers always a fast pace just a lot of movement alright
good,one of the most valuable things I've learned at Sysco is time management.  We are given a certain number of tasks on a daily basis.  And how you manage your time is key to how you will get paid.  Given different incentives over the years and made me manage my time efficiently so that I can make the most amount of money with the daily tasks.
good,In my previous review both jobs are very similar. I still have good friends that work at Sysco Sacramento and still see them out in the field and at restaurants we share.
good,"Going into work at 4:00 pm and leaving at 2:30 am hurt my personal life and relationships. Most of the co-workers were nice and friendly but the turnover rate was too fast to get to know anyone on a personal level. My manager is a good man who cares for his workers. Higher than him, the management became uncaring and unknown. The job required the back-breaking lifting of heavy boxes and other items and monotonous job of putting on Arabic labels to products that needed translation for overseas."
good,A typical day is answering phone calls and helping customers. I have learned how to work with others even if we have different ideas and thoughts. Co-workers are great to work with and are willing to help out if they can.
good,I'm very hard dependable worker..ive held many awards at sysco ...been with company foir 10 years...its good company to work for...very hard manual labor with good pay
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"In my opinion, Sysco  spends money for software applications and platforms that are not in the best interest of the company"
good,"Long days of work with very little room for mistake, management did what they could but they told me i would move up in a year and it never happend"
good,"great benefits learned a lot of different jobs,received a lot of experience from them."
good,"Extremely challenging work environment."
good,I learned a wealth of information in the food industry and additionally acquired further customer service and administration skills. It was an enjoyable career with an excellent team environment.  Management however did not follow protocol in our department with employee relations and pushed many good representatives out the door. Sysco is a global leader and reputable company as a whole.
good,"They got out of their way to hire employees that share the missing and commitment of the company.  Interviews are behavioral based and not on what you know.  Management does micromanage, however, at the end of the day, it provides great stability and an exciting day."
good,The compensation is fair and the chance to grow is outstanding. Leadership at times can be very unrealistic. Mentoring is non exsistent in the enviroment.
good,"Great training, great pay, didn't recieve no uniforms or the proper equipment. Truck and trailer (if new) was for the ones who been there the longest and the ones they was (working on) or in ""bad shape"" was for the ones that came out of training. Dispatcher was terrible and management was terrible after you get hired on."
good,New to the company. Great potential for movement within the company. Pay is average. Work life balance is cool. Insurance coverage is rather expensive
good,Making that the work area clean and santized to USDA approval.I do my job than go help coworkers.Hardest part of job is trying to finish job when product is not in stock.While i was there i learn to cut all kind of specialty cuts of meat.
good,"You start your day early, you never know where your going. Employees of 8,10,12 years still have no idea of where they are going when they come into work. Warehouse will put 1 item for your delivery on the bottom of the next pallet so you have to break down the entire pallet for the one piece. Management will tell you... I don't know why they do that but will do know thing to make changes. The only thing they see is the truck cam back empty, so it must not have been that bad. Co-workers will help with instructions on how to make deliveries. Hardest thing about the job is trying to wrap your head around how poor the warehouse can do their jobs. Most enjoyable part of the job is working your last day for Sysco."
good,"very diverse, overall company is growing. Enjoy working with my coworkers."
good,"Always able to work, but the company didn't mind to over work you if needed.  Not a good job to have if you have a family."
good,Co-workers are very helpfull. get to drive and help custimers.
good,"Working in the warehouse can be fun if you like it and if you don't mind literally standing for eight hours a day and have very little to no contact with anyone else in the warehouse. There was much data entry to the job and a person working there has to have good recognition skills of the product the company is selling or they will not do very well. All in all it wasn't a bad job. There were a few things that I enjoyed and a few things that I did not enjoy but, so it is with any job. I learned how to input products into a computer system, run a piece of warehouse machinery, and experience what the life of a warehouse worker was for a period."
good,"great paying job, no life out side of the job. there is not moch room to grow."
good,Job was driving a 6ft. pallet jack with hard controls  with three pallets with thight corners where you can barely turn have to stack and sort items which can get too 7 ft. tall. Drive around stick labels try and wrap it up too be loaded on the truck. You only get a sorten mount of time to pick. It was UAW so everyone there was trying to stop you get into your way or not trying to help you make your time.
good,"Great company!! I wasn't tied to a desk and my days would seem short. I love to cook and eat, which made vendor demos worth the stress."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,The company offers a great deal of professional resources for their employees and customers.  I try to utilize these resources as much as possible and find success through team work.  I enjoy helping our customers realize they can be more profitable and showing them how to do it.  It is very frustrating when customers do not seem to care about their business and reject obvious solutions to challanges. Recent cuts in commission and an increase in micro management has caused a decline in moral.  
good,"The atmosphere and the people are great at Sysco.  As a supply planner II (buyer), you are very busy and the day goes by fast.  The hardest part of the job is that things are constantly changing and responsibilities can fluctuate at any time.  I continued to learn buying practices and added to my SAP knowledge.  "
good,I learned many useful skills in my 12 years at Sysco. I thought it would always be a place that I would possibly retire from. The company changed in many ways over the last years and decided to start centralized many of our company duties. The goals of the company and the way things were run began to change. It was no longer a place that many people wanted to stay at for the long term. The compassion for people changed and it was all corporate focused. No longer a place I really wanted to be.
good,"Energetic and productive day of inventory control and customer satisfaction of order process and loading trucks. Team spirit was high, but pay structure brought down overall team morale. Hardest part was the physical labor; most enjoyable part was the collaboration of man-power and team work to see a job well done."
good,Management needs help. Most supervisors expect you to do work they either cant or wont do. They use write ups as a threat to make you over work then fire you if you get hurt citing unsafe work practices caused by you trying to keep ip with their delivery schedule more set up by routers that have never been in a truck ir to the delivery sites. As a former driver and marketing associate there i have experianced this company from multiple sides and would say if you are going to do foodservice work it is probably the best to work for out if all of them but you should look for a better career elseware.
good,"Was terminated for a reason that my RSM gave as ""not a right fit for Sysco"", this after opening 6 new accounts in 5 mo. never really got a ligit reason!"
good,"A good stable enviroment to work in, very work/life friendly"
good,Hardest part of here is knowing if I still have a job for my family. Management seems to forget what their roles are when you ask for anything. Anyway
good,non-stop. good family environment; great benefits; focus on customer satisfaction; works well with professional/work life balance; great tenure; good pay
good,"I would like to start off by saying I’m going to be completely honest on this post. If you are shy to working hard and busting your tail, need not to apply to Sysco. They pay extremely well, because that’s the only way to make you show up tomorrow. This job is by far the toughest job I have had, but the most rewarding. You will start any where from 11pm-6am, deliver 700-1300 cases, 8-20 stops with a handtruck, pallet jack, ramp and your good ol pal determination. If you have never done this line of work, you will suck! Don’t give up, it will seem impossible but it gets easier as you grow in to a case moving machine that Sysco gives you no choice but to be. Great pay, my opco is union with full benefits for my kids and wife. Anything over 8hrs in time n a half. Do it! Come work for Sysco, but stay away if you can’t handle a heavy workload!"
good,"The people are nice, but the hours are long and its fast paced, heavy lifting. pay is competitive as you get paid production, not hourly. Overall its decent, but not a forever job."
good,"Great pay/benefits here and always job security but this company is a slave house.... first off you are using a triple palletjack and each pallet has multiple stops. After you pass probation you will be working 5-6 days a week with excessive overtime hours. Warehouse Management System here is a wrist scanner; you have to label every case, work very fast paced to meet demand. This company is a"
good,As a supervisor you are the middle person to Upper Management and to Employees.  You have to show the employees an fun way to work.  Sometimes we are there for 10-12 hours and I do not want them to feel like it just all work.
good,This was my first warehouse job. And I love it's fast pace and energetic and the manger are great  the only issue is my sister just get a job at Walmart center distribution and they pay $17.30 hourly and my location is pay me $12.24 hourly so   I a little confused because I can just  to Walmart for that much. But I still like my job🤔
good,The 26 years I worked for Sysco my wage consistently went down.  They need to keep up with the cost of living on wages.  Too much favoritism.  Dedication into company not taken into account.  They didn't try hard enough to keep the good employees.  I would have never left Sysco if they would have just came up with a solution for my pay declining month after month.
good,"It's a good job but the loads need to be loaded right. Your route is set up to run backwards. This is a physical and demanding job. It's long hours and can be stressful. It don't help when you're solo and have to unload 750 to ,,800 cases by your self and no helper."
good,"I was a street salesman whose job it was to grow the restaurant business and to meet and exceed company goals."
good,Drives a long hour every day and company does not provide any  reimbursement for the  vehicle and the gas. Overly short stuff to support the sales team. Very messy wear house situation has mistake on packing and delivery almost daily.
good,It is an ok company to work.  They could improve on compensation and the amount of work you do.  Some people move up with ease and others cant.  It is not base on ability or skill set
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"love to sell but unfortunately,I'm not fun of travelling. I did enjoy selling and meeting everyday with different clientele and different challenging."
good,I was exited to work at the Sysco at first.  After working there in Wilsonville Oregon I was told at first I would have proper training and it would  take 9 month to 1 year to learn the Contracts at first received training then people were quitting in my department a lot. When I asked for additional training because too many contracts were given to me that I was not familiar with I was told by a co-worker to figure it out myself. Tried to go to management but did not get anywhere.  The stress there was too much then I found out later that someone that started way after me was paid over $4.00 more per hour.  Not fair for same work
good,we work at 6pm- 3am and our sleep cycle is pretty annoying. you have to get used to it and the overtime which is almost every night for the rest of your life there
good,"This is a face paced job, and not for someone that isn't looking for a challenge every day. I would suggest this position for someone who is not afraid of knocking on doors and being told no."
good,Fast paced and sometimes long hours. Must be very proficient to survive the work industry. Overtime hours are there if you like OT. Night shift was a plus.
good,"I stared at 7:00 am, picking up the money from the warehouse to reconcile vs documents and make the deposit to be send to the bank."
good,"fast paced demanding well payed job, all the hours yu can stand good working environment great employees. management had its ups and downs.. work hours were the worst part"
good,If the food is not moving we are not doing our job for our customers. I had to make sure that from our material handing equipment to the fleet is properly maintained and PMed. That the maintenance budget was on track in keeping us running. Making sure my teams safety was always 1st when conducting work on the equipment or the building.
good,"Good company overall, management is good, corporate goals are extremely high and there is continuous pressure to meet numbers. Very stressful at times"
good,"It was really hard work which is fine with me and I did good throughout my training period, but once it came time to meet the 100% rate I just couldn't get into the rhythm. Some people did really good at selecting, but the work and third shift hours just were not for me."
good,Solid company to work for. Good pay and benefits. Advancement opportunities are limited at best. Due to constant short staffing and employee turnover hours are long and at times difficult than need to be. 12-14 hour work days are a normal at my co-op.
good,This company was ruff to work for. I could be way ahead of schedule and then not be able to find a particular product . That product could be on some other pallet in the trailer . Sometimes taking a hour of longer to find.
good,The job consist of very long days sometime.Im scheduled 10 hours but could be there 12.The management  needs some work on people skills.The hardest part of working there is the climate change working in the freezer
good,I only worked at Sysco briefly and just decided it wasn't for me. Very fast paced and time deadlines must be met when selecting orders or you may be let go either way. The pay was decent and the coworkers were nice for the most part.
good,"Great pay with great benifits, overall good company and they have high expectations in a physically , performance based warehouse"
good,"a typical day at work is getting all sales reps lined out follow by checking call from over night and responding, have at least 5 appointments set to help close sales deals, afternoon briefing on meeting sales quotas, have solid plan for following days to achieve goals for team."
good,"Aprendi a lidar melhor com as pessoas, fiz amizades, tive uma ótima supervisora, um ambiente agradável de se trabalhar."
good,"Great pay hard work! Being a new employee sucks! You get the worst trucks, worst routes, always will work on your off day. Routing is horrible!!!!"
good,"Food service sales, unfortunately, the furthest territory from the office, and I lived even further outside that area created an almost unbearable time and mileage requirement daily.  My departure was based upon my own situation, not company related."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Very fast paced place to work, behind on the safety aspect of a work environment."
good,overall very good company to work for......lots an lots of perks.
good,The work place was fast moving and never dull. Unfortunately they later asked me to work hours that conflicted with my school schedule. Promotions are frequent if you show skills necessary in higher management positions. Friendly and generally decent people. Some of the more difficult parts of this job were things such as the heavy lifting and climate changes as you may end up working in the freezer one moment and dry dock the next.
good,Lots of hours.  sometimes over worked.  People who loaded trucks did not do their jobs correcty resulting in damaged product being delivered to customers.
good,"Productive and fun workplace with table tennis table.Fast,pace and productive environment."
good,"data entry/heavy phones"
good,They let u work at your own pace.when you start pulling orders throw out the shift.
good,"Rapidly changing, technologically advanced environment, but the stench of ""good ol' boy"" is still in the air. Although, for such a large facility, everybody knew everybody."
good,"In my 3 years of working with Sysco, the most memorable moment was experiencing the thorough training process. As my time working there expanded, the company's flaws began to unveil. It was starting to get short-staffed."
good,"Delivery of cool, frozen, dry foods to restaurants/fast food joints, all hours of the day/night, place delivery in appropriate area, up and down ramp, in and out freezer compartment, scan each food item prior to delivery, sort customers order from pallet containing other customers orders, get your asss kicked!"
good,"Great workplace. To much multimanagement. There are to many corners cut. And people pass accounts down to you as a ""favor"" but its really a joke. Make sure you know your numbers and stand up for your self. "
good,Sysco is one of those companies where if you don't like to work it's not for you at all because it's a daily work out to work there picking 160 to 250 plus cases per order isn't for everyone at all and yes you are timed as well they do have a certain rate you have to pick at a case and half per minute in order to stay on top of the pick rate for the 8 hour shift .
good,This Job gets you in Shape Diet and being Physically fit helps with your performance.This is a delivery job so going up stairs and downstairs happens. You work 50-60 hours a week. The Pay is great Summertime is hectic. 80k-95k is the salary
good,"A sub-par operation that thought very highly of itself. Had many good individual players and even some spectacular ones that were saddled with inadequate leadership. Action for the sake of action was prized at this company as was a cutthroat dynamic. Cult of personality is strong, but evaluating substance is not. Very flashy ad high levels of confidence but not accompanied by any sense of ethics or personal responsibility. Always comparing themselves to a nearby sister company but what was said did not match what was getting accomplished. Very high hopes but many have flown the roost so as not to languish in that environment."
good,Work is tolerable and at times enjoyable. Most people are friendly to each other. Great benefits. Upper management does not communicate down the line. Change in rules left people without raises they were promised. Union dispute still lingers and brings uncertainty of the future.
good,"Worked for Sysco for almost 11 years. It is a very competitive environment and also very stressful. I enjoyed the people very much, however, management was my issue. I received a recent promotion and relocated for it. Current management only focuses on negativity. There's no positivity and no support for the learning curve. I'm a firm believer of building your people up not tearing them down."
good,super competitive industry - you need to learn all about the many products that are available. it really is amazing that a customer can place orders by dinner time and have them delivered the next morning.
good,"Company culture has changed over the years. Great company, constantly changing, must be able to adapt. Management style in each department differs so it is likely your personal experience will as well."
good,Very clickish atmosphere. The production people were great. When I was at another Sysco facility we all worked together to make sure everyone succeeded. I have noticed in Florida employees do not work  very well as  a whole team. It more like this is mine don't even try to help.
good,Great company for benefits but the pay is low for the work you do! Loads are almost always messed up as loaders and pickers bury products under multiple cases so you handle the cases multiple times before they can be delivered.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Typical day would be to clock in on time, start working requests in the domain assigned, go to 9am meeting, then continue to work requests. It is very routine and not much change. In order to stay in game, you must be best friends with management or get the boot."
good,Sysco is a good strong company has its ups and downs. It will grow to be largest in world. Lots of changes to come with staff. For 19 years I called it a 2nd home
good,"Good Work Place, Great Benefits. Friendly atmosphere, lots of perks. Customer Service department is weekend and Holidays. Must be willing to rotate weeks and weekends."
good,"The company is a good company with good benefits, but very poor work ethic employees.  Employees are very jealous and envy of each other.  Management doesn't monitor employees work ethic like they should."
good,"I believed I would retire from this company, but was abruptly laid off. I ask what I did wrong and was told ""absolutely nothing...it was a corporate decision.""  But I would return if given the opportunity."
good,Liked working there.great experience for a young guy .fun working on different cars. Fast pace work enviorment and fun people to be around
good,"great place to start your sales career.  Extremely challenging and competitive-this is not a sales job for the weak."
good,"Trucks are loaded for the drivers, but not well organized. You frequently have to tear apart whole skids to find one piece."
good,The company is a good place to work for - great co -workers! There is a lot of deadlines and you must be able to time-manage well.
good,This job opened the door for me to become a Federal Employee. On a typical day we were always busy handling the many fires that arise in a large organization. I learned that hard work does pay off. Management was ok for the most part. I traveled across many states and overseas which was both a challenge and exciting.
good,"Great place to work, except outsourcing many  jobs to India. Great benefits and management. Morale is low because of layoffs and restructuring. I would say probably my favorite place to work because of the job challenge and amazing co-workers."
good,"I work there for almost 12 years an I finally left! But I didn’t won’t too but they force me to. A never could advance my skills there until I turn my 2weeks notice in an than I got offered another job their, but it was to late so I left to better my skills"
good,"I enjoyed working for Sysco, the only downfall is that the company out sourced the Accounting department. Many employees was forced to retire or receive a packing to resend."
good,"I worked for short time in Sysco and it was a good experience for me, The paid of this kind of job is low because it's a really hard night job and during my short time work there I saw a lot of people leaving from the first day, I believe they have to raise them paid more, so people can stay and the company doe's have to spend more time and money in training."
good,Company is well known with relaxed work environment. Good stepping stone for experience and benefits are good. Just depends on your individual lifestyle if it's for you.
good,"During my working experience in this company, I have learn some other civil works because I handle surveying and also road networks activities which include to my working experience in construction."
good,"Some of their management needs to know the meaning of diversity! You do not make comments of people because of the color of their skin, religion or their work ethics."
good,It's a good company to work for especially if you are in management.  People are nice for the most part. Sometimes you can move up in the company depending.
good,"This is a company that is going through lots of changes at the moment, but is till managing stay stay on top of its competitors and is in a goal for saving money.."
good,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed my job, co-workers, support staff, basically everything about the company, their overall agenda was not something that I cared to explore any further.  "
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,I worked a Sysco since April 2005. I loved the environment. My co-workers were patient and management was very involved in helping the workers to be successful.  I love to be a team player so always volunteered to help others when I was not busy.  My days seemed to go by pretty fast because I always stayed busy and always stayed on task. The hardest part of my job in the beginning was learning the systems. The most enjoyable part of my job were the cookouts in the summer. I was flexible and volunteered to work overtime or stayed after hours to make sure the job was done.
good,A company that likes to have fun. Culture council are always finding ways to engage associates; they make you want to be apart of the company.
good,"A typical day would be 10 hours of contacting current and prospective customers"
good,"Great benefits"
good,Management is pretty hands off if you're doing your job well enough  The work/life balance can be a drag because you're required to work at least one weekend day per week without a day off during the week as a trade off.
good,"Fast paced and long is what my days are like."
good,If you like to forklift and take home roughly 1700 every w weeks than this job is for you. For selectors is where the money is. Just dont tell them you know how to forklift bc than they will make you do it and you will loose money
good,I was let go due to a restructuring. The finance function was centralized and outsourced. I had a GREAT boss who was very flexible when it came to getting the work done. My plan was to retire from Sysco. Unfortunately that didn’t happen. Sysco is slowly centralizing everything so unless you are face to face in dealing with customers be Leary of working here. Benefits are great though.
good,"Its a good company to work for,good pay good benefits, no complains but i quit because it was not for me. I move on and I will find something else.  Its ok"
good,Start your shift around 3:00 am deliver an average of 18 - 20 stops 800 - 900 cases daily. Most of your pallets are combined with multiple stops which may be time consuming when digging product out for a specific stop.
good,"Work out!!! this job is not for a lazy man!! this job makes you use every muscle ,if your lazy..fat.. this is not for you. You have to be fit and understand that if your not  quit before you even fill out the application"
good,"start work at 5 pm ,learn from other employees to work faster , management help new employees feel at a safe work place, the hardest is the last couple hours of work , and the most enjoyable is that you can work freely with nobody to tell you how to do youre  job"
good,"It was a split day, Cashier in the morning and A/R in the mid morning until the end of the day. It was a relaxing place and friendly people to work for and with."
good,"good place to work good supervisor and management "
good,very little down time. enjoyable work environment. very little team building and hard work is required to succeed. self motivation is a must but very easy to do in this environment
good,This is a good position (marketing associate) to be a part of if you like sales.  You have flexibility and talk about food all day.
good,Decent work environment with mediocre pay. Co workers are very upbeat.
good,To check all monthly invoices and make sure they were compliant with the pricing. Coworkers were great and very helpful to each other.
good,"A typical day at work would be to check emails every morning and working with suppliers and vendors in order to streamline productivity. I have been working with disputes and analysis where extensive research is done. What I have learned on my job assignment is how pricing is involved with each supplier/customer and their produce. My co-workers are very knowledgeable and we work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is making sure that pricing is correct in the system (SAP) and that pricing and contracts are adhered to and not deviated from the deal. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers/suppliers and making sure that pricing is correct and I have done what is expected."
good,hard work. how to order pick .my boss was cool.co workers worked hard. learning how to 7 tie stack . the work out u get u wont need a gym or a pair of weights
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,No review just dont like the work. It has very cool mangers and the environment is cool.
good,same thing forklift ect and hevy mechine opr. ect daily working with these items
good,"Pros"
good,"The work was similar to other custodial jobs.  I made sure the"
good,If you enjoy working form your car ninety eight percent of the time this is for you. Spend most of your time alone in the car and cold calling. Lots of problem solving needed for this position.
good,"Very little support from upper management and a very inconsistent place to work when upholding rules and policies.  Management is barely supported by the Human Resource department and this is the biggest mistake Sysco makes in my opinion.  The company tries to make everyone happy, but in reality that is impossible and creates a worse environment."
good,Great co. Workers and team environment.  Management. Could have been more involved and people oriented. Average work day flowed but very strict about hours and overtime.
good,"Upper Management is solely about  "
good,"Sysco is very driven to be and remain the market place leader in food distribution. Their focus is on profitability and high profit margin."
good,not a very good place to work at all poor leadership no comarodery and give it all to us attitude  six years of looking over your shoulder every day brings you to the breaking point the warehouse is controlled by the union and their continuously trying to break them with no success  what a joke
good,Great company with excellent benefits but there is no trust with their determination of commissions paid.  Autocratic.  They will allow a new District Sales Manager to keep their position regardless of the fact that he is disliked by all his reports.
good,"The corporate office is a good, but not great, place to work. The people are very nice, but management lacks focus which translates to frustration among employees."
good,great place to work as long as you keep yourselff in line and do as told
good,"Good money, no life balance, no time for family. Good pay and benefits. Don't care about employees health and family only worry about job getting done."
good,"After 8 months I was laid off due to the reduction of productivity. All of my job duties where out sorted to another country.The time that I was there I learned a great deal. unfortunately, the company will not hire from within."
good,"This job was nice til you make a mistake and they fire you or turn on you very fast, management and the company itself does not care for the employees"
good,Poor direct management in a brutal industry. Tons of time required to be successful well above and beyond any form of work/life balance over a 6 day work week.
good,Great company to work for. Sysco needs improvements on service which is the most important part of the job. They over promise and under deliver making it difficult when dealing with accounts.
good,"Good company, great pay and benefits, great hours if you like nights, with no time for your family, friendly staff and most supervisors, understand things on a real level of life."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Bad management & we are on a 3rd party contract with sysco so its hard for us to know if we lose the contract we are out of a job so I need more job security
good,"Very strong/solid company. You will learn quite a bit in this role, but there are too many job requirements to master anything extremely well. You must be extremely adaptive to change and welcome it.  Very poor work /life balance. You will work 7 days a week."
good,Lots of systems and policies with promotions and meetings to go over new things.   Lots of moving parts and challenges to overcome everyday.  Need to be focused and self starter
good,"was an early shift mostly 3am start times. meet lots of great people "
good,This position is a very competitive from all aspects.  You must maintain aggressive sales growth while attending to a multitude of  daily requirements.  You must be self motivated and driven to achieve high levels of success on your own.
good,"If you are a selector you can make great money. I was told when I took the clerk position I would get quarterly reviews amd a yearly raise. Due to management dropping the ball, I worked my butt off the last year gor nothing as I found out that since they jave not given me my reviews,  I am not eligable for a raise until next fiscal year."
good,"I worked in the Memphis Opco. The department I was in needs a managment change, The benefits are good, great people for the most part. Company going thru many turn overs at this time, they need some management restructure. I enjoyed my job and even the long hours at times, I believe I made relationships that will last long past my employment there, I had planned a career not just a job."
good,Fast paced job that allows for income growth for those dedicated. Work/life balance is difficult to manage.
good,With work hard and well manage to middle management and staff. good communication between worker and staff.
good,very rigid management policies where my history is to be able to create original new and successful proceedures
good,Productive place to work with good compensation and benefits
good,"Interesting mix of corporate and sales mentaliity with a strong base in customer service skills. The foodservice industry is very transitional and is processing a decreased personal contact sales approach. The price battle is decreasing the availability of unique products, resulting in a cookie cutter concept of offerings available to the customer. Constant availability to the customer is difficult as the foodservice world never sleeps. Without question, fascinating people in this industry."
good,"It's a tough and fast paced environment! It's difficult to have a work life balance. However, if you can work hard it can be worth it depending on the job."
good,If you have a wife and children do not work here. You will be tired you will be working long hours and it is very hard to reach 100%. If you are young with no children this is the perfect job for you and lots of money to be made.
good,"It's really hard to balance life and work. We can work long hours and it can be really rough on your body, but the money is great. It can take a very long time to get on dayshit unless you move to a different area."
good,"A great experience to work for the #54 company on the Fortune 500 list.  Sysco offers a lot of opportunity and continues to grow, has a winning        culture and is poised for greater things in the near future."
good,"Not to sure."
good,"fast paced environment. go, go ,go, all the time. need some more balance in the work place. always cutting benefits, eliminating training programs, hard to stay current on important training updates without missing work."
good,"good company but bad management, its not what you know, its who you know. "
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"The hours are long, but the pay is great. As with every place, the culture depends on your perception. I wouldn't say there was anything hard about the job, but the challenging part was managing personalities; which in the end isn't that bad if you're a peoples person. The enjoyable part was interacting with different people on a daily basis."
good,"The job is fine. The pay is good. It is fast paced an stressful, lots of pressure. You don't really feel appreciated much, besides the good pay. Not a bad job."
good,Good place to work but if you want to make money you must hit rate of 105% after ten weeks of training or you only get paid your base with is $16.50 an hour.
good,"The workplace has become stressful due to upper management centralizing positions.  Due to this the work place is unstable, and causing additional stress; it makes employees unhappy.  All hourly employees receive no bonuses, but are expected to work as hard as salary who does receive bonuses.  Sysco is a hard company to work for, and you cannot come in with any emotions on your sleeve.  It is also difficult to advance within the company.  As it is a who you know; with a little what you know environment.  The only enjoyable part of the job is the employees.  As they are all in the same boat on the not knowing if have a job tomorrow."
good,"Sysco deliverers food and supplies to food serving establishments. A typical day would include visiting clients, talking about trends and promotions, giving marketing feed back, helping with P&L and inventory for establishments. placing orders and ensuring correct product is shipped and received. "
good,A good spot to start your career with advancement opportunities. You get medical/dental/vision insurance with 401k and PTO. Analysis and Data entry are apart of the daily tasks.
good,"Ongoing training in sales techniques and product knowledge "
good,"I have continual contact with sales staff via phone as well as with customers, which is the favored part of the job.  "
good,I worked for SYSCO for 16 years . I started as an order selector and was promoted to a Night Operations Supervisor.  I was I identified as a haul of fame Employee 7 Times. making me a great choice to become the Operations Training Supervisor. Then an opportunity came to move to the Merchandizing team where I was a Procurement specialist  swiftly becoming a superuser / Trainer.until a 3rd round of Corporate restructuring eliminated my Position. So My review is both  Positive and Negative of SYSCO. It was a great place to work for years Then understandably The company went in a direction that did not benefit the Employees. Companies Today have stock holders and they are accountable to show gains. But at what cost Great employees like myself are discarded and the one that remain are left to struggle patching up what  remains. Saying that I would never have Left SYSCO but they may have done me a favor now I must look for a new career in a new world where it is no longer expectable to walk up to an employer and shake a hand and hand them a Resume. Everything is done Online Through Websites that can't see you and talk to you and may discard your application do to an underlined work or a shaded area. if your reading this and your seeking employment Good Luck and keep your head high. every day is  new day.
good,This is a fast paced job with excellent benefits and a competitive salary. The management isn't great and there can be some problems within the work environment due to the competitive nature of commission pay based work.
good,Always working. No real days off unless you take vacation days. Constant issues with transportation and fending off other companies that come in and drive prices down.
good,Great global company to work at!  Good place to work.  Limited career advancement.  Low pay for responsibilities.  Good management.  Good stock to purchase.
good,Worked in Cape May county. Summer was Great. Lots of business and Philadelphia branch Loved us. Winter ?? They want you to sell in Vineland and Millville. Manager had a Big Ego !
good,"Typical work day includes logistics and planning, interacting with drivers and management on a daily basis. Fast paced work environment that continually changes down to the minute."
good,"IS an ok job is not a job to retire.  Overall your pay goes up and down and the company makes out better than the employee.  There sales force is treated like a second class citizen, but they expect the world from them.  If this company could just get out of its own way it would be a great company.  They do not understand so much that they are modeling there new sales approach after us foods that is failing and is over 7 million dollars in debt.  Sysco will hit a wall just like the housing market did if you are behind that curtain you know what i am saying,  you cannot play with your pricing to make the stock number look better."
good,Operations is a great challenge and has many opportunities to help the company reach it's goals through reducing expenses and improving working habits
good,You don't know what you have till its gone.. Great culture.  Happy people and a happy place to work.  Stressful job but it is much better than US Foods.
good,It was a good place to work for but the training should have been better and if you were lacking in part of your job they should reteach then let the person go.
good,"The culture of the job was amazing but the actual department was strenuous. Some departments you are overworked and paid little, other departments you are paid well and the responsibilities are minimum. Though, Sysco is a great place to work if you have very little to no experience in corporate America. As long as you have a degree you will be hired."
good,"Sysco was a great company to work for however the hours ranged from 50 to 60 hours a week. Had to work every Saturday, with only Sunday off. I enjoy being on the road and servicing customers, but when the management team does not communicate or have the routes scheduled correctly it can cause your day to be stressful. Management team is in Houston therefor they were having problems scheduling the routes in the Austin Area."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"I was asked by a guest where the perfect place was to propose to his fiancee. I told him about this view over the Gatineau side. I even helped him pick what to wear. I also told him what time the sun was going to set. He said thank you and the next day he told me everything. She said yes and he said they were going on their honeymoon in the Bahamas. Lastly, he said he would remember what I did for him and he invited me to the wedding. Although I could not attend because it was an expensive trip, he said he will not forget me. It was a great experience because I feel like I helped spark something for a special couple."
good,"fast paced, very competitive. good place to work, good people, this is a good employer that has good flexibility as needed. "
good,Good company to work for. Big company that invests back I to itself. New equipment to work with. All the newest technology. Work is very steady. Tough part is working most holidays.
good,"Balance and persistence is the key to success. This job is very liberal. You build your own hours and your own days but it can easily get side tracked if the focus is not there. You have to juggle a million and one things at the same time. But overall, it can be rewarding."
good,"I love working for Sysco and my Northwest Wisconsin team. I am fortunate to have a wonderful book of clients and I am awarded a reasonable salary for my efforts. Sysco has encouraged me to better myself as a manager as well as a salesperson. Their support is outstanding. From purchasing to logistics and everyone between departments, my Sysco experience has been extremely positive."
good,Loved working here. When your not in the office it's great. Long hours and great pay with great benefits. Physically demanding. Once you get a route your golden. Do your job don't play the politics game. Stay out of the office and life is fine. Weekends are yours to relax.
good,It is a demanding and challenging position but has been a good company to work for.  Alot of changes w/in the Corporate structure for all OpCo's to become more unified.
good,"I worked AT Sysco, but not directly FOR Sysco. Sysco, itself was a good company to work for. I, on the other hand, work for the contracted Lumper Service company, Belmar Integrated Services, which was NOT a good company to work for. It would be unfair for me to rate Sysco above, based on my experiences with their contracted Lumper service."
good,I enjoyed the daily interaction with established customers and viable prospects. Enjoyed assisting customers build increasing sales and profitability. Absolutely loved the members of my Sales District and their support.
good,"Sysco is an industry leader which offers a stable working environment, both at the associate and management level. The operations staff are unionized and leadership requires a great deal of diplomacy to achieve success."
good,Sales reps have Flexible Hours and tons of opportunity to grow their sales and increase Commissions. Though getting harder and harder to make significant Gross Profit due to increased Competition. Fun working with restaurants and helping them build their menu and grow their business.Some Upward Mobility if you work hard and stay focused but it takes a long time to make advancement due to some Nepotism within the organization. Lots of changes recently with respect to product offering. Some Local Brands being discontinued to make room for More Profitable nationally Contracted items. Company is Mostly all about delivering profits lately. A lot of the fun has been drained out of the Job.
good,"Did not care about home life we worked over 14 hour days 6 days a week, never had a chance to spend time with family or events."
good,"Overall good company however the transportation department pays low.  The warehouse area gets paid incentive based on production along with the drivers.  Matches 401K by 6%, great health care options, 2 weeks paid time off, one week worth of sick days and time and half for over time and certain holidays."
good,"Great opportunity to learn.  Other than this I don't care to elaborate, thank-you very much.  And if you want me to keep typing to get past this point, that is fine with me.  Every Good Boy Does Fine.  Is this Enough?"
good,Overall decent job with full benefits and opportunity to get overtime. Working nights gives chance for daytime progress.
good,"Marketing associates day never ends and your on the move all day long meeting appointments , growing profitable  orders for you and the company . All commission sales"
good,"Management was not secure.  During my tenure I've had 5 managers, not productive considering each manager was learning and had no experience dealing with current IT changes as well as policy changes."
good,"Good place to work. good pay, fun co-workers, good hours. do not get hurt at work. the hardest part of the job was when there machines malfunctioned and as a result I injured myself."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Good salary, great benefits, Learned SAP which was a plus as an added key to my knowledge, fast paced great friends."
good,Sysco is a fast paced organization with constant opportunities and new situations.  Change is the only constant. Development is somewhat limited in some departments.
good,"Great food company,  awesome sales and warehouse support.  Great benefits. Lots of supportive people.  Very competitive industry."
good,Not a bad place to work. Hours can be long during busy season but the money is better than most places around here. Work is hard but rewarding.
good,"I've been delivering for 10 yrs. 3 yrs with sysco. This place has good benefits. Management sucks. Us drivers (especially in outlining yards) get hammered day in and day out. Routing doesn't care. You have to complain like a little kid to have management and routing get stuff fixed that you asked to get fixed. "
good,"Stress stress and more stress.  High pace all day everyday.  Very demanding. However, my co workers were great and it was a great team."
good,"very early start time , pressured to meet delivery times and schedules. learned that it was all about the company and not the employee. some good managers and others that where not willing to coach and lead just there for the day . drivers and many employees worked well together warehouse not so much. hardest part of job was the weather and heat of the day ."
good,A typical would be hot no air at all. The hardest part would be loading the parts. The managers are laid back and help others with your work.
good,"Sysco is well-respected.  The earing potential is strong as long as the marketing reps make themselves available 24/7.  The margins are low, considering all the competition. "
good,"	Managing the Local Area Network which consist of Windows98, Xp, Windows2k and Win7."
good,run a shuttle 455 miles a night enjoy job but management is very hard to please now cameras in trucks 60 mph up and down hills (dont not go over 60 mgh no excuses)
good,"Working in the freezer,in a face pace. Picking Orders."
good,This is a great job if you're new to sales and learning the business.
good,"Everyday the workload changes -- busy to not -- but that leads toward the ability for all employees to keep to overall common goal in front of them -- to exceed customers expectations.  The tools are available to all employees to do so, definitely a position where any individual will get out what they put in."
good,Sysco has a very high turnover rate because of the sheer physicality of the work required. Nothing can prepare you for what you will have to do to get the product off the truck. The benefits and pay are great.
good,I worked 65 hours a week and that was to much for me and for the pay I was getting for my service. The work was easy and the company made getting around more easier than other companies I work for in the past.
good,"Sysco is the leader in the food distribution business and is a great company to work, the management promote a family type atmosphere and team work is encouraged. "
good,Overall good place to work. There is some high pressure sometimes but that's the same for any workplace.  There are some really fantastic people working there.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,This job is a lot stressful because you have done route in specific time and you have a lot stops sometimes not haven't time to finish and have still sleep in town.
good,"overall good place to work , health insurance is lacking though. high deductible. Insurance is reasonably priced however. Would be nice to get 2 days in a row off"
good,Contract job with a nice department; hourly pay was very low. Helped out the department with purchasing invoices; I enjoyed the department but it was just a temporary job.
good,Great company...learned tons and experience alot but also work 7 days a week due to the nature of the business. Lots of opportunity to receive bonuses outside of the pay check. Good overall morale and a very professional atmosphere at all times. BUT... At the end of the day...it's all about the #s and loyalty holds no ground! All and All...Great opportunity!
good,Sysco was a fast pace great place to work. I was a chef/ sales manager in charge of helping customers increase revenue while utilizing sysco brand products.This was a fun place to work. Learned tremendously on how to sell and serve the customer.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company because I learned many new skills.  They are organized and well run.  Due to size of the company, they are fairly progressive."
good,Good job the pay is good but for the amount of physically demanding work you earn every penny. Could be a little higher considering the type of work. The work life balance is not good until u r extremely senior to everyone ex 8-20 years under ur belt.
good,"good place to work. benefits were good as was pay. new manager could not do his job, which led to looking for employment elsewhere. when interviewed applicant will know immediately if manager is same one."
good,"As Warehouse Order Selector, it is required to meet up certain percentage rating  with accuracy. This is a quick-pace and physical job that requires body motion (lifting, bending, kneeing, & walking)."
good,"Above average pay, but be prepared to work for it.  Unless you have about 5+ years senority, you will be delivering to an average of 10 plus stops (that are always changing, despite bidding routes) that are NOT pallet stops.  You will move everything in your truck at least twice (average day 800-1200 cases) and deliver with two wheeler up and down flights of stairs, through boston alleys, and into low ceiling storage areas.  99% of the time I did not have a helper."
good,"Develop relationships"
good,The department I work in is upbeat and a fun place to work. It is an ever changing company and there are always new challenges to face but it keeps you on your toes
good,"Sysco is an extremely stressful company to work for, but it does come with its benefits. There is a near limitless ceiling if you show initiative and drive. The company does expect a lot in return. Work/Personal Life balance is almost non-existent."
good,"Not a good place for a new driver as you will trying to put a 38 foot trailer places only meant for cars. The work is grueling, the average day for me was unloading 20,000 pounds in 20 plus stops.  The most stressful part was trying to find your stops and where to deliver as GPS will get you too the front door but not where you were to deliver."
good,Sysco is a great company to work for.  Been with the company over 20 yrs and we continue to grow the right way.  As we continue to adapt in this new market.
good,Sysco is growing. They have a great business model. They roll things out in an organized fashion. There is a lot of change which some handle better than others. They offer training too.
good,"Unfotunately  i just started  it so. I will give you what i know so far.  A typical day is stressful day is hard because you trying to catch on learn what they show you .the workplace is safe and open.the hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with your numbers on your job ,but breaks,and lunch is where i get my joy because i can talk,relax, and enjoy my coworkers."
good,"At Sysco, I would manage the software stocking systems.  Restaurants and sales associates needed to know if the product was in stock or out of stock or when it could be available for them. The company's computer system was antiquated, so it was an adventure Usually I would train sales associates on how to decipher the best methods for figuring out what product they needed."
good,It is a very structure and vey driven by fear and not a lot of leadership and direction. It seems to be different depending on the area and location. I'm sure they have some good companies in the US.
good,"Overall, Sysco has been a good place to work. My coworkers have been amazing and made the days fun. The most challenging parts have been the constant."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Working in a sysko company is very physically and mentally demanding. yes you get good salary but physical stress is way to high. Best part is weekend are off .
good,Management team would have appreciation day for employees to show they were doing a great job. Made everyone feel like they were apart of a team and there ideals matter.
good,"This is a union job.  Right away you pay dues but some guys wait YEARS to see the benefits of that.  Certain standards must be met before you're really ""full-time"" with all that should entail."
good,"It was a 24 hour operation. Started at 6:00 am. First task was to inspect all trucks to ensure they were in accordance to DOT regulation.  Ensure refrigerator trucks were at proper temper.  Ensure employees were wearing safety gear.  Verified routes and made any necessary changes. Reviewed all invoices.  We all learned off each other and have good teamwork.  The culture was diverse and fair. Job was enjoyable, challenging and rewarding. Hardest part of the job was when someone called in."
good,Good money if you are in a large metropolitan area. Not so much in the smaller markets. Very poor work/life balance. Management does play favorites and are not shy about it.
good,"Sysco is a good company to work for. They take care of their employees. There is good coaching, mentoring and training."
good,"Every day was a busy day. Lot of deals to be made."
good,empresa tramquila jefes y de mas empleados sociables y con muy buena comunicacion laboral
good,"·	Asist drivers with their daily deliveries "
good,"you do more then one job in a day."
good,"This was a great place to work. I learned how to drive motorized pallet jacks, how to unload trucks, separate produce, and palletizing, and shrink wrapping."
good,"Employees are overworked! Corporate is in the process of centralizing a lot of OpCo processes, leading to lay offs and alienating employees even more."
good,"As Sysco in Houston made changes the culture of the organization became much more ""corporate"", focusing more on processes and less on the employee and the customer."
good,"The hours were long and fast-paced with lots of multi-tasking and heavy workload.  There seemed to be a greater focus on quantity than quality, and it comes down to numbers at the end of the day.  However, it felt like the highest management at my specific location really did care about their employees and strived to provide incentives and fun events, such as holiday breakfast with a Santa for the kids (complete with gifts for each child), picnics, annual trip, bonuses, monthly meetings with birthday & work anniversary acknowledgment and giveaways.  My immediate department management swung between micro-managing and absence.  The department one worked in could make a big difference in company experience.  For the right person, it could be a very rewarding long-term career; for the wrong person, constant stress and pressure."
good,good company but management could use drastic improvement. offer all three shifts for people looking for that option. the workplace culture could use improvement.
good,"I worked as a Warehouse Food Selector and for me that job was fun.  It was very fast paced and required a lot of focus and physical demands. Hardest part about the job was learning the stacking skills while operating a ride-along pallet truck. Good staff who were always there to help and good freedom within the warehouse. Just showed, worked, and went home."
good,"it was a good work environment, great coworkers. very vague on job descriptions. Management was pretty inadequate & payrate is very unstable. The hours aren't horrible either."
good,"it was a very productive job which I enjoyed working for several of years however, being that my wife is in the military I had to quit and relocate since she has to PCS."
good,"People are friendly as well as helpful, great place to work and learn. The HR staff is very helpful and do a great job of explaining benefits. Has a family feel to working there."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Sysco is now focusing on centralized administrative tasks at their shared services location in Texas.  Sales and distribution will continue to remain at the individual distribution sites.  They continue to standardize all functions for efficiency.
good,"Typical day would be meeting w/the supervisor before the shift and stretching."
good,"Worked here for about 4 years, not a bad company to work for. They have competitive wages, excellent incentive program, and good benefits. Management can be a little tough at times but overall everyone is usually happy."
good,It is the fun place to work for. Flexibility in selecting the on site clients of our choice. good packages and career development. good training and skills development.
good,fast-paced work environment with many learning activities and coaching available.  great management and willing to assist in any way needed.  pay was good and flexible schedule allowed for family time.
good,"Performs activities related to AP Invoice processing. Processes merchandise invoices by performing"
good,Sysco is a great company with many opportunities for a motivated individual to excel. The only downside I would say is it a very large company so is thus very bureaucratic.
good,Tough environment but rewarding compensation for effort spent. Teamwork and working together was strained due to intensity of the workload. Lots of great people that worked hard for the company.
good,"Sales reps are taught for 6 month and you are to find work for the company. You have three weeks after contacting a possible client if not, if you don’t establish a them as a customer then that potential client becomes your manager’s client. You must call in every half hour to an hour in order to listen to all the managers reports on the meats, fruits, vegetables etc. If you don’t they know about it and you get warning and be written up for it. On top of this you are limited to a particular area and can’t open up any account outside your limited area even if you have a customer and he wishes to open another location somewhere outside your restricted area. Must be on call 24 hours 365 days a year. You are issued a lap top and even on your day off in the beach you must be able to take orders for clients at all hours. There is a minimum for delivery and if a client need one item you must drive to warehouse and pick it up yourself and deliver it personally to client. They train a new sales force every 6 month."
good,"Long days at work, usually 14 to 16 hour days.  Management does not always follow what they are telling you.  Tried to learn new things but had resistant from manager.  Enjoyed working with some of the sales force and other supervisors."
good,"Fun people to work with at Sysco and with the TCCC team."
good,"Sysco is a great place to work, they have great benefits."
good,Was responsible for the upkeep and repair in the freezer. Maintained forklift equipment. Performed PM and did repairs. Did daily walkthrough of all the freezer equipment and performed most building repairs
good,Love working for this company.  Dealing with people over the phone and helping people on a daily basis. The people are upbeat and work as a team to get the products to our customers.
good,"Great company to work for,good pay and good benefits,health coverage is not bad,if you love being in night shift for 15yrs then this is for you,co workers are a tough group till you know them"
good,"Participated in project budget planning and development."
good,Great people to work with and for. Customers are great and I enjoy interacting with them every day. They all bring light in to the day. Long running company that is well liked by all
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Warehouse environment that completely adheres to all work safety rules. This position challenged me but also helped me grow in the ability to handle more tasks. I enjoyed working for my manager very much.
good,"There used to be more loyalty in sales and now it's all about the price.  Sysco is a high quality kind of company and have the prices to go along with it.  Unfortunately, many restaurants these days are not focused as much on quality and it's all about cost of goods sold."
good,great place to learn the ropes. Superior training and products. I learned a lot from this company. Enjoyed working here but in the last couple of years the compensation had changed so much that I had to move on.
good,"Once you establish a routine, most days run smoothly."
good,A great partner for your food service business. The company has a great selection of  categories to sell any foodservice business.
good,Travel is exactly 50% or more which limits the work-life balance. Company culture is great for the most part. Compensation leaves much to be desired.
good,Deliver goods to customer locations everyday throughout WNY. Using a two wheeler off the back off a trailer. Long days and hard work. Pay and benefits were good.
good,Sysco is a very supportive company to work for.  The training process was very good and informative.  Before joining Sysco I was in beverage sales.  It was very interesting to learn the food side of the business and the challenges my customers dealt with on a daily basis.  Food sales is very competitive in New Orleans and I am fortunate to have many customers that I have dealt with for years.  I have developed a trusting relationship with many of them.  Because of my established relationships it was easy for me to move into a successful marketing associate position at Sysco
good,its jus work. its the same thing every night come in get prepared to work a 8 to 12 hour shift. and hope you get enough sleep to be prepared to do it all over again.
good,"More than 8+ Years of experience in Web Application Development & Designing."
good,This company was very professional but to large . they treated the drivers like a number rather than a functioning part of the company
good,"friendly, competitive working environment.  like family.  continuously learning with week after week training classes with hands on learning and venders of all kinds. Busy schedule, fast paced.  Weekly and monthly prizes for accomplishments."
good,"clock it start selecting till all orders are done."
good,You normally spend 10 hours a night working with little thanks. Lower management are all friends so not much room to move up.
good,worked in freezer. had benefits. was able to work overtime when needed. gave the tools necessary to achieve success in your work environment.
good,Sysco is a great place to work. They typically pay below market rate and there is opportunity to advance. It's a very laid back environment.
good,Overall good company to work for. The local team in Jackson WI cares about their employees and helps to make you feel part of the team.
good,Kept busy constantly and management listened to all concerns and needs. I felt management truely cared for its employees.
good,"I clean the freezer, and then the cold dock.  I work well with my coworkers and supervisors.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the cold temperature and the most enjoyable part of my job is the pride of working my job."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,I worked with a terrific group of people who were highly knowledgeable and well-organized.  The environment was very friendly.
good,"Shipping Clerk"
good,Can't think of anything negative. Really good place to work. They take care of their employees. They promote within. Lots of family events.
good,Good company with good benefits. They unfortunately don't give you full time hours as promised. The hours were changed to overnight hours.
good,I was honored to work with some of the most unselfish and hard working people I've ever met while at Sysco.  As a team we were able to bring the company back on-line after devastating hurricane Katrina.  What an unbelievable and valuable experience for me as General Counsel.
good,Working at Sysco I quickly realize the fast pace work environment that I am apart is something that I am more than capable of doing.  At first the hardest part of I couldn't get use to was running 100% on orders that I was given.  But I manage to surpass that struggle and was able to run 100% on most of the orders throughout the night.
good,"Horrible place to work."
good,No day is the same as the last.  Everyday there is new obstacles to overcome.
good,I enjoyed working in the many different roles at Sysco Minnesota. I had achieved all my Sales Incentives and Promotions in each position I held for 19 years of employment. I fully enjoyed the customers that I brought on and loved seeing them succeed with the diverse consultative work I had performed for each account.
good,"Good company, very long hours, routing not the greatest, compensation needs to be monitored due to inaccuracies."
good,"	Microsoft Certified Information Technology Professional"
good,Very stressful management unrelatable to Drivers Money does not match type of work.
good,"it was a nice job"
good,"Decent workplace environment, Friendly atmosphere, Travel, Organization"
good,Was able to help bring new ideas to restaurants.  Never a dull moment.
good,I enjoyed the causal work environment but the job was very routine.  I need a little more challenge.
good,"This was my first job in Canada and I learned a lot of things here. How the work is done at a workplace. "
good,was a great place to work until the corp. close the doors which I feel was a big mistake
good,"Very fast paced, test of agility. Great Benefits, but did not leave much time to spend with my family."

good,Was only there for a few months. liked my co-workers and managment
good,"I started working here after my son was born.  Supervisors and staff were friendly, I didn't work there long because I wanted to be closer to home."
good,"A typical day at work involves weekly reporting for different Sysco subsidiary companies, interacting with the CFOs of those companies and troubleshooting any reporting discrepancies."
good,Fist accounting job. Learned how to process invoices correctly. Catch discrepancies on both our buyers and our vendors. Good atmosphere.
good,"•	Experience in grouping, sorting, summary, charts etc using crystal reports"
good,"They are the best in the business.  Make your own schedule, great co-workers.  Loved getting to meet so many different people and selling them the best products out on the market.  Innovative"
good,"Extensive experience in account management, account penetration and prospecting (cold calling) Consultative selling approach combined with strategic critical thinking skills"
good,"Everyday is different, and will keep you on your toes.  Some say that Sysco stands for See Your Situation Change Overnight.  Recently switched to SAP and has made life a bit challenging.  Sales position is not about sales anymore.  It's about operations, making sure your orders get filled, collecting accounts receivable, and managing disputes if a customer returns an item or short/over pays an invoice.  Keeps you busy."
good,Things they can improve upon: work/life balance and pay scale. They have a lot of efficiencies and systems in place to be the best distributor though. 
good,"Plan and execute sales calls with current customers. Take orders, find out needs and make sure penetrating account and becoming a partner not an order taker.  Plan cold calls or ways to bring on new business. Place order's make sure to be accurate as to avoid issues upon delivery. Collect money, educate and train. "
good,Credit analyst...handled over 4 districts of sales people working with them to get money collected while keeping sales.  
good,typicla day at work is very fast pace.
good,This company tends to move people into mangement positions that have no business being there. Other than that good place to work early mornings and off early as well.
good,"Starting with Dispatching, follow with payroll daily, weekly spreadsheets, work with great personel at Sysco, from V.P of operation to manages, drivers and operation supervisor"
good,Really have to be motivated and manage your time properly. High expectations from Sysco on a daily basis. Great job for balancing life and work.
good,"Une entreprise avec un bon poteniel. Des changements sont prévue , mais sont t'il prêt?"
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"typically prepare and wrap orders fro shipping to local food outlets, receive and organize food and goods in an organized and safe manner using the first in first out guideline"
good,Managed existing account base and prospected new clients.
good,"Good family valued place to work. Work from home, flexible hours, good benefits, great location."
good,Carefully maneuver a triple pallet jack through several isles in warehouse. Pick products then stack items on pallets at a high rate of speed.
good,A typical week at Sysco was a full week (7 days you are working NON-Stop) Very little pay for how much you work.
good,Complete all tasks on my agenda. Learn new areas of the SAP System that we utilize. Management is ok could be more informative and attentive to employees and the work assigned. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfaction of knowing that product is in and service level for the company is great.
good,"• Taking orders for customers/ selling $35-40,000 worth of business per week"
good,"A dream job for most people, but not everyone can do the job. You have the opportunity to learn about things that every body knows something about but never as much as you."
good,"I worked for Sysco in sales from 1980 to 1990, for ten years. It was HFP Sysco when I started there. Unfortunately I got caught up in a transition period when we had a new President and new sales Manager and a new district supervisors all coming in about the same time. I had a local territory and they felt they needed to make some changes. I was forced to give up my local Harrisonburg area to someone else and was expected to move to a different location. I had just built a new home in the area and could not afford to sell the house at that time and move me and family away so I resigned under a little pressure from management. Overall I enjoyed my experience with Sysco but unfortunately I got caught up in big management change."
good,"Sysco is first and foremost a sales job.  You do make a base salary, and can make more depending on how many accounts you can bring on. The job can be quite rewarding, but that mostly depends on the customers you deal with daily."
good,Working at sysco is not bad. Hourly associates are paid very well for the work they do. My only issue with working there now is that I am a supervisor on salary. I work so many hours and am making the same amount of money as the people that I am supposed to supervise.
good,It is a friendly and team oriented place to work. Changes to job duties and management are frequent. They are supportive and willing to help with your job growth.
good,Loved working  for Sysco and whom and what it stands for... the building  was in didn't care for the people. But as the whole of the company ie president CFO and others are who made feel honored to have worked for them.
good,I have had many rolls within the company. Different offices have different cultures. Sysco Pittsburgh I would say is the best. Buckhead meat has it's struggles.
good,"- hard work life balance"
good,Great place to work and gain valuable skills and leadership experience.  The company is changing quickly and often so it also helps your change management skills .
good,"This is overall a solid company and I enjoy the opportunity to push myself to be more coordinated and efficient as a CDL Class A Delivery Driver. The work is extremely hard and dangerous and the warehouse at Sysco is in very bad condition right now. These conditions add stress and frustrate customers. However, my job as a driver is simple, keeps my mind and body healthy, and pays very well. This is a great job for athletes with customer service skills as well as healthy active businessmen. "
good,The company itself was great. Management did not make it easy to stay. A lot of lack of communication that made day to day responsibilities difficult.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Nice and laid back atmosphere, very young company overall. Training seemed to be satisfactory but follow ups for that training were lacking.  The idea that you've already been shown something so you should just know it now was not conducive to creating a very open environment for asking questions."
good,expectations are high for all employees. If you are dedicated and want to work you will earn a solid income with great retirement potential. The work environment can be very stressful but rewarding. Often have senior manager changes but the option to move up is ther e for the right person.
good,no life outside. Hours are through the middle of the night and its very hard work and can be stressful. if you are single and just want to save money its great but for family oriented men it is extremely difficult. other than that every day if you throw an error less than every 1500 cases you'll be charged. After 7 charges you are fired. very easy to get errors.
good,"Heavy lifting, fast paced, non stop, overnight work. As an order selector you are constantly moving and lifting heavy boxes to load on to pallets. Must be in shape."
good,Good sales position for food sales. Product knowledge is important but constant training on products is available. The territory can determine a lot of your compensation.
good,"Good benefits, 401k. Day shift is off Saturdays and Sundays. Good opportunities for advancement. Competitive pay. Hours can be over whelmed during high season."
good,Sysco is an awesome company which promotes personal and collective goals. However the time schedule is very difficult to balance work and family life. Also the job is time based which makes it very difficult and fast paced.
good,"Great place to work. Enjoyed the interaction with all departments, challenging and fun work and getting to try new foods all the time. Learned something new every day."
good,Sysco was a good company to work for. No cap to earning potential flexible schedule to work around family events. Great benefits offered to employees and their family
good,Great operating company - one of the best in SYSCO - Corporate took over and everything went down hill after that - especially moral - it was hard to transition from a hard working group of family - to a corporate run do as we say or go culture
good,"Alot of people are on here with there negative stories but i was told the job description before i started and i was also told the salary. All i can say is you work hard you play hard ,  but this job gets easier not harder . After you learn how to do your job properly it gets easier and almost second nature . Ive seen guys walking but make incentive rates of up to 30.00 an hr in Indianapolis, in so it is what you make it ."
good,"Sysco stands for systems and services. The culture when I resigned in 2006 was very different. The company was generating about 35B in sales. I left and came back in 2016 for six months, but I had a hard time assimilating and today the company is over 55B in sales with a  very healthy profit margin.=Good company but hard to advance."
good,work schedule is nights Sunday-Friday. Only off on Saturdays. No Holidays off. Its a good position if you strictly want money.  There will be no outside life with this company.
good,"I have a lot to be thankful for when it comes to my growth and development, working as a Marketing Associate for Sysco Foods. They have helped me become an all rounded sales consultant / sales representative. Sysco has made it possible for me to be successful in this fast paced, quickly changing, technical world which we live in. The amount of knowledge that I have acquired working here is endless. Even though a balance in work and a home life seemed to be very challenging at times, I am grateful for having been given the opportunity to have worked for this Fortune 50 company. I enjoyed the interaction with my customers and building relationships. I also enjoyed creating needs which helped grow both my customers business and my own."
good,"There just isnt much room for growth."
good,"Gained experience in cold call sales for new and potential customers, with a focus on maintaining relationships and sales growth with existing business.  Daily problem solved keeping my customers vested interest and meeting the needs  of their individual business dynamics.  Gained favor in a competitive market by exceeding expectations of chef's and owners. Typical day was 10-12 hours with some time off Saturdays afternoons to Sunday early morning.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great Team as well as dynamic/individual customers even those who were the most challenging."
good,"Sysco is a great company, however when corporate got involved at the local level, changing the commission schedule, removing the retirement benefit, it became unprofitable to work here."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Hard workers are hard to find so the hardest workers have to make up the difference. I didn’t mind the work but no one could explain the pay efficiently. Hourly/per case/mileage/stops but you never know exactly how much you’ll make until you receive your check. If you are a harder worker then your average delivery times will lower your case pay which leads to more work for the same money. If they can figure that out then I would highly recommend them.
good,I was a sales rep for about 2 1/2 years....I learned a lot.  My first DM was amazing and helped you with anything you needed but he left and my new DM was a joke.  If your not selling frozen cheap food at every single place your not going to last long...Co workers were awesome too.
good,Typical day at work was first check emails then visit all of your current customers then visit your prospects.  The job required that you develop relationships and build your business.
good,Need to be very organized. People person. Food service knowledge isn't required but is recommended. On call at all times. Must have a thick skin and the ability to adapt daily.
good,"Equipment is very poor condition, employees are reckless and cut-throat environment, fellow employees don't follow procedures to take proper care for customer product nor take in consideration of fellow employees safety while selection is in process"
good,"High pressure work place, can be very stressful work enviroment.On going training. The hardest part of this job is the ever changing food products that you need to keep up on."
good,"To be successful a person has to be self driven, organized and constantly going after new business. Training is very good and management is there to support and mentor. "
good,"Regular day is 8 am to 5 pm , 1 hr lunch "
good,"Week starts with planning activities and updating through Salesforce daily.  I visit customers and try to sell them more line items, a way of increasing sales.  I also cold call, and work on leads generated through salesforce as well. I take orders, and put out any fires that may pop up during my day.  I have to react quickly and prioritize my day to be as effective as possible.  We have a strict cutoff for orders, so all has to be in a timely manner.  Customer service and relationship building are my strong points."
good,I really enjoyed the people of Sysco. It is a relaxed environment. i had contact with people at other Sysco house across the country. Had to learn to access my emails often.
good,put Data and orders in the system for delivery the next day or per order.did orders for delivery.route drivers or tucks the next day. put orders in will call for pick the same day also.picked orders from warehouse and checked them for accuracy..this was daily.
good,Overall good company. Lack of workers makes it harder for guys that are in the warehouse.  Sometimes asked to do more than required if undermanned. Good pay
good,"Good place to work, too many management changes during my time there and some favoritism eveident. territories are not protected the way they should be and leads are very biased!"
good,There are opportunities to grow if you want to learn. Pay is not competitive and is controlled by corporate. Senior management puts the companies performance first before employee happiness.
good,"Well Management People"
good,"Largest food service provider in North America, expanding into Europe, Ireland, etc."
good,This company understands that you have a life outside of work. You get to work with great people.  I made a lot of friends in my 20 years of employment.
good,Sysco is a very diverse company with people from different ethnicities. It is a fast paced environment geared upon customer satisfaction. Sysco services 60% of the restaurants in the Houston area as well as 50% of the school districts in the surrounding Houston area.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"At Sysco, there's open communication where one could feel part of the bigger picture. Hence, facilitating trust between employee and workplace. I would definitely recommend Sysco."
good,"They work you harder then you are expecting but they have no problem paying you for it "
good,"A typical day at work at Sysco is performing all duties I have assigned for the day. So I may complete all duties during the 5 day work week. At times I'm required to assist any office equipment assistance."
good,"Its very good place to learn all type of basic issue related  to desktop support & resolve as well."
good,"When you start off, they will give you a light load of 500 cases to 600 cases per load. once you finish the load you go home. after 5 months you start to unload 800 to 950 cases per load, did I mention you unload with a two wheel dolly. They always send help when you fall behind at least. Its more of a mental stress that makes you wanna quit exp. Some Customers will not take there order by twelve. now your behind."
good,I have enjoyed my five years of working at this company and would recommend it to anyone who is looking into getting into the food service/distribution industry.
good,Procurement Manager make work enjoyable.  Her motto work hard play hard. She also facilitated the work life balance initiative a priority for the group
good,"Great place. Managers are just not on one page. Friendly environment to work at. The employees help with anything you need. Also, they try to work around your schedule the best they can."
good,"Management is not communicative when trucks are not dispatched or loaded properly. Scattered days off, no guaranteed weekends off. Overall great benefits and salary. Management need to communicate more."
good,Calling on customers and prospects throughout a typical 7 hour workday.  Manage any problems in an efficient manner.  Suggest new products and services available.  Make your own schedule for the most part.
good,Overall a pretty good company to work for. Management is not the best and job security is not the best as well. Overall most people seemed to be stressed out
good,the work day was always fast passed the culture was a little tense depending on the work load the best part of the job to me was knowing i was playing a major role in the customers product making sure the right item was picked and staged at the right loading door mi really enjoyed that test.
good,Not just a sales job.  But logistics and procurement as well.  An opportunity to be the customers partner and a key to company and shareholder profitability.
good,Typical Highly competitive sales with a company that is the best in the business. But also maybe to big? Sales staff is pretty consistent but they seem to move upper management around to much including fast promotions and demotions. Terrific experience on my part I just chose to find other opportunities.
good,"Have to work whatever hours are needed and can't leave until it is completed"
good,Long hours interfere with personal life. It will distance you from your family and friends. But you will have an opportunity to make a lot of money if you don't over work yourself.
good,"Great employees, enjoyed working with customers and vendors.  Management changes made things difficult at times.  "
good,"I enjoy what I do, it takes time to find a good work life balance with this position, but it is possible. The company has good leadership and there are a ton of resources to help you succeed, you just have to know who to reach out to."
good,Mid level corporate management team can provide some better direction. Unexpected layoffs with limited opportunities for advancement. Lack of clarity and direction.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Great advancement opportunities with little to no education but fairly poor work/life balance.  Great people that all have fantastic drive but the culture get's ruined by the need for more productivity.  I prefer quality over quantity and Sysco prefers quantity.  If that's your thing you'll love it!  If it's not then you might struggle with the balance of what you want to do and what you need to do.
good,had difficulty with the training process as i had never worked in sales before. Would have been better to shadow someone for a longer period.
good,"Typical day is review of SOX and operational controls.  Some special projects are available.  Overall great teamwork, everyone is very helpful and understanding.  I learned tons on internal audit and operations as my prior jobs were external audit jobs.  Management is making changes and pushing forward.  The hardest part of the job is the required 50% travel.  The most enjoyable part of the job relates to the people I worked with."
good,"overall great company to work for however managment would need to require more training, utilize more skill set from collegues verses buddy system."
good,"Sysco is a great company with excellent benefits. I was surrounded by a management team that showed favoritism and only came out of their offices when something was wrong. Our VP of Merchandising was afraid of any type of conflict and hid in his office all day only coming out when there was an issue. I thought leadership was about talking to your team daily and getting to know their individual challenges not sitting back and analyzing data all day and assuming they know what is really going on and really getting to know their people."
good,"Sysco was the hardest job I have ever had. 9-12 hrs of selecting food items and building 6 foot pallets out of them. My body just didn't cooperate with the work. Had I have found this job 10 years ago, I could have made it happen."
good,"Grab gear, do safety check, stretch, pull orders in time given and palletize, drop at assigned door and repeat until all orders are filled"
good,"this company has many different benefits, the staff were great to work with on a daily basis."
good,"I liked the hours worked I like that I work four days an had three off, the work was very physical but I like that it keep me fit an keep my moving an not standing in one place"
good,Call on customers daily showing product collecting A/R and taking customers orders. Co workers and manufacturing network fun to work with. Hardest part of job being available 24/7. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom .
good,Great place to begin an entry level position.  Management was supported employees about advancement and cross training. I saw a great future with this organization. It was only due to a reduction in staff that I am no longer employed. If given the opportunity I will like to work there again.
good,A good company to work for that provided plenty opportunities for advancement.  It also provides a good work/life balance.
good,"16 hours of hard work was a full day, great group of people to work with and valued me as an employer. I enjoy seeing my customers daily."
good,A good place to work.  Inside pricing sometimes made it difficult to sell product competitively.  Good sales people do not always make good managers.  Both times I worked here this was always the case.
good,"Over the years, I have learned a great deal from being part of the management team at this company. This company stays competitive through constantly evolving and staying up-to-date with the best technology and equipment, and our greatest asset is still the people."
good,"	Pulled product according to sales orders"
good,"Great place to work with a lot of flexibility in your schedule. Manage yourself at your own pace and get your work done. Anyone with a food and beverage background looking for a more steady lifestyle and family life, this is a great company to work for."
good,"Oversight of all accounting functions."
good,"Excellent company to work for. However, work hours are long and yes you will work holidays. Management is easy to work with and salary and benefits are pretty good compared to industry standards."
good,"This is a fast paced environment with lots of transactions taking place.  You have exposure to a large customer base over 5,000 active purchasing accounts.  "
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.

good,Good place to work. Good pay. Very physical job. great benefits. Well established company.
good,Great company they work well with sales force and they are very good at targeting business.
good,Sysco works place used to be great until recently the company switching into something totally different.  the culture has change from a secure and caring place into horrible environment.
good,Overall job OK. Mid level management imported from other companies. More work for less pay than previous years.
good,"Monday through Friday were spent visiting existing accounts to take orders, collect on outstanding balances, and increasing my product line in these accounts. This was done by price manipulation, broker visits, samples, and just plain asking. During this time, I was also prospecting for new accounts to increase my base. I enjoyed learning about the needs of my customers. Having worked for a chain restaurant, I loved learning from the independent owners and chefs I was in contact with. The hardest part of the job was being on call seven days a week. I worked with a great group of managers and salespeople that worked together to help each other whenever needed."
good,"A typical day at work consists of data entry and problem solving with invoices and discrepancies. I learned a few new software systems that Sysco uses and certainly broadened my knowledge of computer skills. The management does a good job with day to day managing and keeps us updated on current goings on. My co-workers and I all work very hard to keep up on daily work loads. The hardest part of my job is the intense amount of work to keep up on and knowing my job will be gone within an indefinite amount of time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with, we get along and help each other out and feel like a successful team together."
good,go in and start doing letdowns for pickers. putaway any left over incoming freight from day shift. keep to myself. hardest part is the lifting up to 100 lbs.
good,"I usually file paper work dealing with each construction site, help send out checks to vendors and put payroll in.  Key in data about each worksite such as: weather, how many hours worked at the site, how many constructors worked on the site, and progress of the site completion."
good,"long days hard work"
good,"At Sysco we juggle many responsibilities including growing sales, opening new accounts, collecting payments and many other tasks throughout the day.  You must constantly prioritize the most important tasks and follow-up is a must.  "
good,Deliver food product to stores and unload it for customer while maintain a safe driving record.
good,It has been and continues to be a very challenging place to work.
good,"It was up to me to pay myself raises, by adding new accounts, cuttings to show customers the benefits of using my brand of items. I would also demonstrate new items that would fit into my customer menu and adding more revenue to their business. I worked from my home so being dedicated to my job to start early so I could talk to my customers on their schedule and not when they were busy, My highest gross income was $65,000.00. At the time my terittory was in the Upper Peninsula, from Lake Superior to Lake Michigan, The customers base was quite large."
good,Sysco has been very good company for me to work for the past 25 years but they will be downsizing ther IT staff the first of the year
good,"For years was one of the best places to work, they cared about their employees and the employees cared about Sysco. The emplyees knew how the system should work and could maintain it through intrinsic knowledge, documented knowledge and personal commitment. Recently the company decided to lay off a large portion of its IT department for ""cost savings"". The are now paying an Indian contractor to hire more people to do teh same job, but with no knowledge of the Sysco systems. This is not saving money, it is hiding cost; it cannot help customers becasue the people taking over have know knowledge aboutHOW teh system works, IT is more than just systems, it is enabling a copany to succeed through technology; meaning people are a major factor. The company appears to have forgotten this."
good,If you can work hard and meet their strict standards for speed this is a great job.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"My co workers were great. I trained almost all of them. I enjoy training people and helping others out. To see the look on there face is the best feeling in the world. A typical day would be to drive to my customers and take orders on my laptop, show them new ideas and products make sure they are happy and go to next customer."
good,"A typical day at Sysco actually flies by because before I know it. I haven't taken a lunch and it's almost time to leave. I work with a lot of friendly down to earth people that makes the long days more enjoyable. The hardest part of my position is beating the clock. There never seems to be enough time in the day. The part I like most about my job is woking with my suppliers. They are in Canada,New York, East Texas everywhere and we talk and share life stories like we have known each other a lifetime."
good,"Enjoyable,  but very demanding.  Can be stressful.  Fast paced, corporate environment changing though. The job can be very challenging.  Good people make it easier to.do."
good,You can be as successful as you want with Sysco as long as you are willing to put in the work. Tools are in place for you to gain knowledge and become the best you can be.
good,Wake up little to early most the time and do pri inspection of yout truck. Then driving and delivering food to the diferent places and I would recommend this place for getting CDL and getting expirinces
good,Work was good most days definitely stayed busy. Working alone was definitely was a challenge especially if things went wrong like if the load fell over or missing product or even buried items. Customers and coworkers were respectful and just good people.Fast paste work. Good benefits still a good company
good,Working at Sysco was a very professional and busy environment you are required to be responsible for all products that breaks which means you have to be very careful operating forklift and loading and unloading trucks but overall it was a very good company to work for and I don't regret working there
good,"Sysco is a fantastic company to work for. They have great benefits, fantastic pay, but the work is hard. Some things are unrealistic when it comes to goal times. They compensate very well, with pay and benefits, everyone is willing to help you thrive, but if you want a Family/ Work Life balance this isn't the place for you, being the fact most nights are anywhere between 12-14 hr shifts. Money is great people are great but things need to be added to help Order Selectors do their job more efficiently, productively, and just overall employee work / life balance."
good,"benefits are good, salary in the freezer is not enough the may need to step up there, management is not fair and overall not bad at all may be better a little bit compared other warehouses"
good,Strong Corporate culture. Great pay and benefits. Very high expectations. Associates are expected to work long hours plus occasional work from home on weekends.
good,"SYSCO is a great company to work for I spent 20 years with SYSCO  went from Selector to Dir of Warehouse, I was given the chance to move up in operations early in my time there. The last few years the opurtunity to move up was closed off."
good,This position is about consultative selling and providing your customers with the tools and guidance to survive the highly competitive restaurant industry.  Challenging and highly competitive the opportunities with Sysco are abounding.
good,"The hours are long and the work is hard. This is no place for amateurs. At Sysco a ten hour shift was an early day. And you'd better plan on working Christmas. But there's a real sense of pride and comradeship that comes with it. Sysco warehousemen are industrial athletes. The best in the industry. And the pay, benefits and job security are top notch."
good,"A good place to make money "
good,"Long hour workdays"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of, first - operating a pallet jack, filling orders for customers, Second - loading the pallets into delivery trucks, Third - operation forklift to replenish stock."
good,I had to buy the least as possible but not run out of the product. Make sure the product was stored and rotated properly. report updates to supervisors. fast-paced environment. traveled to visit suppliers manufacturing facilities.
good,"Sysco is a great company that has many career paths.  Technology is booming and after acquiring a tech start-up, multiple doors opened.  Sysco is already developed and not a ton of room for growth."
good,Sysco Distribution of columbia is a good place to work. It the work is hard and you get paid fair. But just don't get enough hours. The health insurance are good . you have three different type of department. They are dry cooler and the freezer.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,My hours are from 10:00 to 3:00 four days a week.  I scan all the documents so the other associates can readily find the information.  I have learned a whole different business and enjoyed learning.  My manager is very helpful and taught me a lot.  The most enjoyable part of my job is feeling good at the end of the day.  Feeling useful and helpful.
good,Great company to work for but executive management tends to hire from outside as opposed to hiring within. Some room for advancement but it is limited
good,"You work to your customer's schedules, that involves weekends and holidays, early mornings, and sometimes late nights."
good,Fun and exciting workplace excellent benefits excellent pays maintenance technician pays excellent experience co workers experience working only in the maintenance field
good,The driver helper position required being flexible in hours and location of work.  The job is physically demanding and mentally exhausting at times.  Overall my experience was good and enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"really nice fortune 500 company---great benefits."
good,"If you are a new driver Sysco is a great place to work, you really learn how to get around the city in a big truck.  Great co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the physical demands on your body, but if you can stick with it it will get you into fantastic shape."
good,"I will not lie to anyone, this is a very physical job. Unloading a tractor trailer by hand using a hand truck and/or pallet jack. Most customers are great and appreciate what your do. Most managers are former drivers so they understand the struggles.  I will work here as long as my body will allow it."
good,staff was great to work with. great pay and benefits. good hours for warehouse. employers were great to work around family schedule and were good if you had to leave for family issues
good,"Basically the opportunity for advancement at some point requires relocation to some usually unattractive bigger city.  Also there is some baked in cronyism.  Maybe sometimes you'll benefit from that, sometimes you don't.  The comp plan for sales is pretty weak and they basically reply on pretending that the grass isn't greener elsewhere but if you have any sales acumen whatsoever there's more money to be made elsewhere.  That said you can make decent money here.  Also, this is really a non-sales sales job.  It's really more of a relationship building job than a per se sales job.  So probably a good fit if you are not experienced with or uncomfortable selling; but less so if you have sales experience."
good,"Sysco is a good place to work.  They offer many benefits including health, dental, vision, life insurance, FSA.  They host a number of events for the associates.  They recognize employees for their service and are very keen on hiring military veterans.  The company continues to grow."
good,"Most of your time is spent in your vehicle. Your hours are flexible to move at your own pace. Typically, I'm on the road by 8AM and home by 5PM. I spend about 30% of my day in my car driving between my different accounts; my territory expands from Rising Sun, down to Glen Burnie. We have weekly meetings with our supervisors, and monthly general sales meetings at headquarters in Jessup. The hardest part of the job is showing customers Sysco is not the company it used to be. We have changed a lot of systems, and ideals of how to sell and gain new customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and making connections with different people in all different aspects of the food industry."
good,Salary is decent and livable. It was a good commute for me. Offices are well organized and clean. Good hours and moderate workload for everyone in the company.
good,"good company, lots of work, took a while to gets used to the hours, equipment was up to date which was nice, foreman were previous drivers which means they understand your issues"
good,"This(these) position(s) requires the ability to stay on your feet wearing steel toes thru out each work day while engaging multiple tasks from three or more different departments in a large facility often achieving overtime. A typical day at work would include several trips to the warehouse and break room with push carts , opening and closing the kitchen  , running many loads in the dish machine , stocking cases of break room water bottles and supplies from storage , organizing product according to a quasi planogram , following a monthly and quarterly kitchen equipment cleaning duty schedule (changing fryer oil , cleaning large kitchen equipment), possibly assembling displays  , possibly ordering kitchen snacks and supplies requests , possibly setting very large rooms for monthly sales meetings and special functions , possibly arranging buffet lines  , maintaining pallets of product in a large storage room and possibly emptying a large trash dumpster in the ware house.  The hardest part of the job was perpetually overcoming the daily physical demands.  The most enjoyable part of the job was all the different types of food everyone would get to try in the kitchen and the positive mental attitude of coworkers."
good,"Great company,  food sevices  simply was not a good. niche for me.  "
good,Great place to learn the ins and outs of the food industry!  Meet with with customers daily and sell and take orders for food purchases  Mostly restaurants and institutions.

good,Overall my experience at sysco was positive. The other employees are very helpful and knowledgeable and willing to do what they can for new people. However management is hit or miss in that regard.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Great place for advancement, lots of opportunity.  Culture of a corporation, with many employees.  66 billion dollar company thats worldwide.  Opportunity to transfer anywhere in North America and across seas."
good,Sysco is a good company but the work hour's are not good if you want a home life it's a Teamster Union which is a plus so the benefits are great but the work hours are not very productive if you want a home life the training is good in the management is great
good,"we would ride around on order pickers, we were able to listen to music, joke and relatively relaxed environment. we were given a number of orders to pick over the course of the day, so we knew in advance how heavy our day was going to be."
good,"I for the most part, enjoyed my time at Sysco. What you face in a day can vary. Everything from access issues network problems. The onsite team shares support of the local office with groups in Texas and other parts of the world."
good,"Overall good work culture, would recommend working for Sysco.  Fellow employees are enjoyable.  You will be challenged and can put in some long hours, but can be worth it."

good,it was an overall good job. I would go back to it and recommend it to others interested in that type of work. you have to be fast paced and flexible to do other jobs
good,"This is definitely a younger person's place to work , long hours and very strenuous on the body.the pay scale is fantastic you'll make good money by if you hustle!"
good,"Excellent company, but I've never worked in a more cut-throat atmosphere.  Co-workers don't want anyone else to excel.  Feels very much like being back in grade school.  Sometimes a hostile work environment."
good,I worked in Healthcare with Sysco. I was terminated for downsizing department as well as others to include Dieticians. Contracts with Corporate healthcare companies were being directed to Corporate controls and management.
good,"Can be very hard work, but good people! Lots of opportunities for promotions from within. Good job for someone who wants to have a long career and possibly retire."

good,"I moved up from a driver to a clerk to a supervisor.  However as I moved upwards my paycheck for hours worked became smaller, due to becoming salaried vs hourly.  This is a great company to work for if you don't mind the union and all the negativity that some of the old ""union hands"" bring to the table.  There is no better feeling in the world than looking back on an empty 48' trailer and just seeing your 2-wheeler, empty pallets, and pallet jack."

The hardest part of my job is not always being able meet the customers’ needs. I always enjoy interacting with my customers and co-workers."
good,This is a company with great benefits. Good work environment.
good,"This is a good stable Job, very little advancement, alot of indoor polics Hard work."

good,I worked in the finance department under credit.  Manage was a great guy.  Got to work with the sales people which I enjoyed.  Got played off 2018.  They centralized their  credit department to Houston.
good,Very challenging job with a great employer. Opportunities available for those who choose to work hard and put themselves out there. International fortune 100 company with local and broad scale opportunities.
good,Sysco was a good company to work for. I enjoyed the ability to be able to discuss better ways to help customers with my supervisor. A typical day at work included doing your pretrip early in the moring depending on your dispatch time.
good,If your a az driver that's tired of sitting all day or night and like to work this job is fast paced and good hours. U will have stressful days but at least u get a little excersize.
good,Wonderful organization with the best team I have ever worked with. Very clear vision of what they want to become and how to get there. They adjust to potential threats and are constantly brainstorming on how to improve the organization and include lower level staff in brainstorming sessions.
good,Sysco from day one was a very supportive work environment that provided me with the necessary tools & resources to get quickly familiar with the Sysco way of doing business. I enjoyed getting to wear many different hats day in & day out. Intense work days with many things to take care of where accountability and time management are key to getting business done. Training is a big plus to keeping up with what’s happening in the food service industry. Great management team and good internal resources.
good,"Number one in the industry.  Offers benefits and retirement.  Professional, business casual and uniform attire depending on position held.  Daily work deadlines."
good,"Sysco was a good company. They did require a lot of computer work outside of the face time with customers but were constantly improving their platforms. The only downside is, customers use your personal number and can call you at anytime needing help. This is a salary plus commission job and you will be required to work based on customer needs."
good,"Great all around, people, work, culture.  You must know where you stand and stand your ground. Able to learn and teach.  Pay close attention to details."
good,I enjoy my job at Sysco. If you are not a type A problem solver and willing to make your own way this is probably not a good job for you. Because the company is so large and has so many layers it is not always easy to know the right form or person and so you have to be willing to make things happen. But the benefits are fantastic and if you are working hard and following policy you can expect to do well. I enjoy my job and have refereed friends to work for Sysco as well.
good,Management needs work they have a hard time connecting with the customers and there needs.   Great place to work for advancing and working directly with customers.
good,I worked at Sysco for over 5 years and it was noth good and bad. It is physical and high demand to meet the needs of the customers serviced. This caused the employees to be treated as secondary to the customers.
good,"hard work, earn your money for sure. Typical day will last about 10 hours with some going a little over that. home every night and have 2 days off a week"
good,"Nice Company to work for, love working with the customers.  Sales Team was nice to work with as well.  Enjoy working with Sysco Foods, Saint Charles ..."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"I like my job, but  I don't like what they pay here. I like some of the management, but some are very inconsiderate about your personal life. For example, some don't care about personal emergencies."
good,"As with any Sales culture, successful sales people are results driven, passionate and not afraid to work long hours.  This job is not for everyone. Before accepting a job here, one should ask what they aren't willing to do to be successful."
good,Good company that stays up to date with products and services and one of the best training programs for sales people in the industry. There is support at every facet that a sales person encounters on the street to help them gain new business or penetrate existing accounts.
good,"Great career start. Plenty of advancement, must have the ability to work longer hours and have plenty of face time with current customers. Great organization."
good,"fast paced, Learned to work with business owners, Great sales staff Some departments are short staffed. A large number of older, high salary workers were laid off over the past few years. Good job for contract worker in warehouse or truck driver."
good,A good multinational company that focuses on efficiency and customer focus.  Learning and developmental opportunities exist even with the evolution and structure of the company.
good,I loved working for the Indy location. On a daily they had a mini kitchen inside the wear house. They gave out different sandwiches and drinks cereals etc. most awesome place for breaks By far no other company does that. I worked fleet . I was the evening diesel mechanic and I loved every single bit of it. Some of the guys were up tight and yuppiesbut most the other guys were laid back. I had a helper in my shop and he was an awesome guy. I miss it very much and if I had a chance to return I would in a heart beat.
good,Sysco is very laid back depends on really what position you in . Being a lift driver or a selector is very high pace and will take a little time to learn
good,"This company is a very fast paced they are a food distributor.  I learned so much working for them.  "
good,"Friendly and open people to work with "

good,"If you are a hard worker and enjoy working, this is the place to be!  Personally enjoyed my managers and the people I worked with.  Made a lot of friends along the way."
good,Do not stay too long great place to start. The longer you work there if you don't move into management your pay will plateau or start to decrease. Great job to start get valuable experience then move on.
good,Sysco provided me with a great transition from being a chef to sales.  Sales work offers a flexible schedule but Marketing Associates(Sales Reps) are expected to work on Sundays.
good,There are tons of careers options but processes are forever changing. It is about who you know verses what you know sometimes. They want and use input from the Associates to make processes and the culture better but it takes time.

good,typical day was checking in with my supervisor and getting a heads up on the day. After my briefing I headed to my desk to start my duties. I learned to work with the drivers and also with the union employees. The only thing I didn't like was the damages coming in from deliveries it was messy at times. My manager was very helpful and even sometimes helped with the cleaning. All and all it was an ok job with decent benefits.
good,Loved working for Sysco Portland but the culture at Sysco Spokane is not the same. I would return to Sysco if the Management and mission at Sysco Spokane changed
good,"daily checks, reports and inspections of inbound produce, maintaining product on hand and replies to all email inquires regarding product integrity. An increased product knowledge, keen eye for details and so much more learned from here. Close group of people that are fun to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job is the staff you get to work with and the staff pricing on products able to purchase."

good,"Good place to start and build some foundational aspects of your career.  For me, it was a little focused on the wrong thing.  Id rather spend more time with clients."
good,"Foodservice distribution is a high stress job in all departments.  Profits are razor thin.  With current technology, many of the jobs go home with you.  Culture varies from DC to DC. There are easier careers than foodservice distribution, but it's a living."
good,Long work hours with good compensation. Don't plan to go home once you finish your route you will most likely be sent back out to pick up the slack. Great benefits.
good,I don't really want to talk about a company that let me go after 16 years of service. I was given no real reason for the termination other then I don't fit the direction of the company.

good,Great company to work for. Pay isn't that great. Always giving you free food. Nice guys to work with. The only bad thing was the pay wasn't that great.
good,"Never had a problem working there, always made sure you had what you needed, and was never afraid to ask if everything was okay, and always gave you bonuses for tools, boots, and ETC."
good,"The hardest part of the job is cold calling.  It is very difficult to open new customers due to Sysco's higher prices and stricter rules, compared to other food service companies.  If you are able to succeed, you are well compensated for it."
good,Overall it’s s good company to work for. They take care of employees pretty well. Fast pase company! A lot going on all all times. Must be good at multitasking.

good,Working in the normal temperature part of the warehouse was fast paced and challenge but in time with practice you get the hang of it. The freezer was the exact same job but at 0 degrees which even with the proper gear on I could not do. I was a layoff from my previous employment and needed anything to help pay the bills.
good,"Fast paced place to work, usually something different each day. Lots of info to pass on to get items taken care of, could see where teamwork is essential and getting complete correct info helped solve issues."
good,Working at Sysco is a very fast paced environment. You must be able to keep you and it and be quite stressful. It is very difficult to maintain a work life balance.

Helping employees and their equipment needs (I diagnosed and fixed software and hardware issues). Stock the copier with paper for the invoices that would come later that night and set up my software for the data entry and reports. "

good,"Fast paced hard work, but home daily and the pay is good."
good,"Sysco has a great potential, but old ways of thinking, micro-management, inefficiencies, employee retention, & quality of life for associates make it difficult for them to excel. Be more open minded, trust your associates & let middle management do their jobs instead of holding the down and you could see great changes & efficiencies improved."
good,"Sysco is a very professional workplace , The management is highly supervised and will give you feedback on progression of advancement. The hardest part of the job will be the hours, as an employee you will need to be available for flexible hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the counterpart people you build relationships with."

good,"they change policies often and are metrics oriented,  they pay based on average job description nationwide not taking into consideration cost of living."
good,Good place but u must be very physical and top shape to be the best. Really big on safety. Direct management very supportive. Corporate make it a little less pleasurable with certain guidelines. Make you feel like you a number

good,Sysco of Hampton Roads was an excellent environment to work  when I was there.  I worked there are a temporary employee.  The experience was great  At the time they did not have any permanent potions.
good,At times runs smooth and at times no. Come in to work and punch in. Grab paper work and manifest and head out to hook up your tractor to trailer and the hit the road. Hardest part of job is mental. Work a lot of hours. Go from work to home to eat and shower and get ready for bed for the next day. At times forced to work Saturdays. The most enjoyable part of work besides the money was the relationship you create and being out on the road in your own little office which was your truck.
good,Best job I have had this job is not for everybody if your a typical driver this job is not for you this job is for someone who has a good customer service skills and independent worker very demanding if you have a family and want to make a good buck I'd apply but just know you will see them on your days off unless you live close to the terminal you work out of. normal days run about 12-14 hours on occasion you may work 16 hours your body will hurt but it's worth it great benefits and a pension

good,"Good place to work, job security and average pay. Growth opportunities are limited (depends on the individual and their relationships)"
good,"I worked at Sysco for 4 years and loved it.  The only reason I left is because I moved out of state and they did not have a facility I could transfer to that was a reasonable distance from where I would be living.  I enjoyed my job duties, the managers and my co-workers.  The co-op I worked at tried to make it feel like we were all important along with our families.  There were company picnics and field trips.  My direct supervisor was always willing to listen and work with us when there were issues.  The only negatives were compensation which was mandated by corporate and raises were far and few between.  however there were opportunities to get promoted.  During the recession, they did let go of employees and add new job functions on us that made things a bit stressful.  Not sure if that has been resolved at this point."
good,Excellent environment to foster strong teamwork and support of the overall goals. Quick to adopt new ideas in an ever-changing landscape of customer needs. I very much enjoy working with the organization and its ability to deliver .

good,"Great company to work for, its the only company to hold you at very high accountability and percentage goal standards. They will push you to work better and be a better employee."

good,"Nice job for young adults that pays well and has excellent benefits. "

good,A typical day at work was non-stop running and lifting. Great way to stay fit if you didn't want to pay for a gym membership.
good,"A day would consist of account maintenance and a pipeline of future business to approach. I learned the necessity of being proactive in building my business and the importance of maintaining credit issues and to keep my clients current.  The management team was consistent with keeping us informed of new products and stressed new business to maintain and grow. We had a team of 10 associates that were all willing to work together."

good,"data entry, covering sales staff and taking their orders. learning new programs, enjoying work mates, liking work hours. "
good,"Set up shift daily, ensure proper placement of employees, and ensure timely departure of delivery trucks."
good,"From my sales experiences, what I pride myself most of are the business relationships that I have established. People buy from people they like and trust. I look at selling as helping people make purchasing decisions for products that they need and that will help produce more profit. I truly believe that customer service is putting the customer first at all times, even if at times it may be the hardest part of the job!"
good,"overall good place to work. Benefits are great, co-workers are helpful and supervisors are there to guide and help you if you ask. If your not on top of duties and reports its easy to fall behind. Work is never really over so that can take some adjustments. But over all great place to be if your like to keep on your toes!"
good,"work day was ok, learned to drive forklift,pallet jacks and load truck,management was ok, co-worker was good, the hardest was the lifting,the most enjoyable take too co-workers on brake."
good,"Great place to work, Co-workers are very dedicated! That is the best part of the job. The worst part of the position is the fact that just about everyone is also scared that Corporate is going to take away or ""Dissolve"" their job and move their position to Corporate Control. Thinking out of the box to take care of customers used to set them apart from the competition. However now it's likely to get one terminated. Management are caught in the middle between Corporate mandates and hitting their numbers with a skeleton crew. They are some of the best I ever worked with and I know the past couple years has been heart breaking for them as well. They are always willing to listen and will help if possible, but again most of the time their hands are tied by SYSCO Corporate."
good,: stay focus
good,Order entry daily for your established customer base.
good,Office out of your vehicle. Learned its not whether or not you a nice person. It's whether or not you are making sales. Management is very smart and capable. My coworkers were very nice but competitive in-house. Hardest part was paying for my gas. The greastes part was all the people i met.
good,"The hardest part of the job was the language barrier, Korean vs English. The best part of the job is the management made you feel as if your opinion mattered. I learned that the politics involved with the company is something that you must always view before working with someone."

good,There was a lot of nepotism here at the West Jordan location. Great benefits and incentives.
good,This company is part of Sysco Foods companies. it is a good place to work for I have being here for the last 7 years and i always like it.
good,Sysco Corporation is a very forward-thinking and goal oriented company. Corporate culture is results oriented and promotions are based on accomplishment and merit. Constant monitoring keeps everyone's attention focused on goals.
good,Sysco is a fun sales environment especially for foodies looking to get out of the restaurant business. You work a lot but hours are flexible and you are rarely involved with work stress on nights or weekends. Probably not gonna get rich but pay is good if you're a hustler. Fun people and work life balance is excellent.
good,"Your success is determined by your motivation, the territory you work in and what you inherit. Sysco works hard to support their associates with the tools and resources available. They continue to provide training to all associates to stay on top of the industry. You make your own schedule based around when you visit customers or soon to be customers. You have a lot of flexibility in this position and have to remain disciplined and focused on your work. There are stressful situations you will handle everyday with cut off times, set requirements for case minimums, items out of stock, weekly price changes, specific delivery days for customers and strict guidelines for credit situations. All of which is understandable when it comes to running the business the most efficiently. Once our job is done the orders move to other employees throughout the opco to finally be received by the customers the next day, everyone has to do their part. You are on call 24/7 because the food/restaurant/entertainment industry never sleeps. Expect to only have Saturdays off after 10 AM, and work remotely on Sundays. For the most part I enjoy what I do at Sysco, I believe it takes a specific person to be able to do what a marketing associate does because we are the face of Sysco to our customers. We are there to support them and help them continue to succeed and grow. The benefits are outstanding! However, you do not have a car allowance, phone allowance, and are required to purchase a minimum of 100/300/100 for insurance coverage. I will admit that irritates me very much because our personal cars and"

But other than that, I loved working at Sysco because again it was the people that made it even more worth while."
good,Fast paced environment with focus on good customer service emphasis and good skill building. Great people to work with and very dependable job environment

good,"I would work for Sysco again.  The hours are good.  The work is varied and challenging but can be very fun. Pay structure is fair.  Pay is commission based, but with a base provided so pay does not descend too far during inevitable sales slumps.  Ongoing education is top rate.  Network of support both in-house and from brokers is outstanding. Benefits included medical, dental, life, retirement fund, etc..."
good,"Very fast paced and challenging."

good,"Pay is awesome!!! $15.00 an hour for the first 90 days or until you reach incentive pay of 103%. After 90 days or 100% your base rate is $18.00 an hour. After you reach 103% your pay goes to $24.45 an hour and for every 3% over 103% is an extra $0.50 an hour!! Watch yourself on mispicks, wrong trucks or shorts. That is the fastest way to find yourself on the unemployment line!! So pay and the job depends on your ability to work fast, safe and accurate!! Hours suck 5pm until finished. Friday and Saturday off."

Once I was dressed I would use a rf unit to scan food products to an order an put the product on skids. I drove a pallet jack that carried two skids at a time. I would then load certain trailers foe delivery. Management was great I never had a problem with any type of management.

good,"Assisting to open this facility on time greatly challenged. I had never been tasked with a job of this magnitude. 1M square feet, a 350,00 fleet truck facility and a hundred acres of property. Everything was fast paced. Since Sysco had never invested in something of this great magnitude many items were missed during the initial contracts. I was tasked with contracting the remaining items. Since the facility fell under Homeland Security many issues needed addressing. Many hours and 4.5 million dollars later the project was complete. All of the operations management was imported from the corporate office in Houston, TX. All were in their twenties and early thirties. The great re-distribution plans had some severe flaws. To compensate we worked 14-16 hour days, seven days a week. I had a staff of forty six and six supervisors. We had the second largest ammonia refrigeration system in the Shenandoah Valley. I enjoyed the challenges the job generated. I was compensated very well and received bonuses. I reported directly to the president and had a budget a little over 5.5 million. Although the compensation was extraordinary I realized I was going to burn out. You can only work for so long without a day off."

good,"Sysco is a good employer, they care about their employees and as long as you are communicating and doing your job like its supposed to be done you will have no problems. The pay is excellent and is on a bi-weekly schedule. Start out at 21.50 plus 1.5 after 40hrs, work hourly until about 3 months of experience then you're on you own and you will be paid according to the route which is more. They will train you until you head spin, it's almost like they look at each driver, no matter how many years of experience, like they just started driving a truck. Some drivers like the amount of time spent with a trainer some don't. It is to your advantage to train with a trainer for as long as possible because you'll learn how to enter/exit most of your stops. Any amount of training to be safe as a driver is important no matter how many years of experience we have. You'll drive a different truck daily and most trucks are a mess inside because drivers don't take care of them. They do have some nicer trucks that you will drive from time to time. Overall, I'd say this is a good company to be a representative of and the will pay you well."

good,"Sysco had been my end goal my entire career. It was what I had worked for. I had to walk away because my new wife was completely unprepared for the change in life style.

good,In the two and a half years I have been working here I have not stopped learning. Our management has great experience but is still in touch with the changing environment. The hardest part about the job is the freedom if you are not self motivated you will fail. The best part is the freedom.
good,Fun place to work always new doors opening and constantly learning new things. Unfortunately they have fallen to greed that most coorperations do and downsized many.
good,Was a great place for me to get noticed. i was the General Manager and the owner was very good about letting me run the business for him instead of him interfering.

good,"Due to industry norms the work day is long and fast-paced. I learned to adapt to change and be a innovative manager. Upper management was supportive, and encouraged growth when available. The office environment was light but filled will hard working motivated employees that want the success of all. The hardest part of the job was the heavy work load but the company supported a balance between work and life and that made the demand less of a burden, I enjoyed coming to work everyday."
good,"Job pays great but expect to work 12-14 hour days if you are a delivery driver. It seemed like that I would work, go home eat dinner and go straight to bed. Then get up at 3am and start all over again. They are always short drivers so they overload all the drivers which makes them work crazy long hours."
good,"I have been enjoying my time with Sysco, nothing to complain about.  It's a great company to work for.  It has a comfortable and supportive environment that includes on the job training."

good,"Not that bad of a company at all. Just will completely consume your life leaving no time for home life. Pay was above industry average but definitely deserved for the amount of stress you put on your body. Managers were all great guys, just never on the same page on how things should be ran. Training was average but very inconsistent with the places you will actually be at when your on your own."
good,"SYSCO is the largest food service supplier in the area, and the most technologically advanced in most all areas. I learned quite a lot while working there, and made some incredible connections, professional and personal. I currently use SYSCO as my supplier for my own business, and couldn't be more satisfied."
good,"It is a great company that provides many different areas to learn and develop multiple skill sets in one job function. You get to meet many other entities of different companies and can network in a big way. However, there is a lack of control withing the administrative departments and HR should be more proactive in managing the work culture within."

good,Sysco is was a very good company to work for but the commen sense is that they will have to have customers order online to compete with the changing market.
good,Working for Newport Meat was a challenge. The fast paced environment combined with moving large loads of varying sizes made it a job that not just anyone can due. But the great employees made it an experience I will never forget and management was always looking out for you.

good,Handled multiple accounts on a daily basis. Made sure each account got the right products so their establishment would run as smoothly as possible. The hardest part of the job would have been trying to push new and upcoming products onto an account that liked and used certain products for a long period of time and trying to persuade them to switch to something new or different. Most enjoyable part was trying to gain new accounts and seeing new faces every day. Basically the challenge of trying to gain new accounts or taking accounts from your competitors.

good,"If you don’t mind weird hours and physical work, it’s really not that bad of a job. I make good enough money to provide for my family, the job is simple. Unload your trailer and go home. Benefits are wonderful, most management were drivers themselves and will help you out with whatever you need help with. Has room for improvement as far as routing and workload I believe, but overall I’d say to anyone not afraid to break a sweat to come over. The worst part is the amount of time you have off between shifts. We are a union house and they make sure we have the best benefits available."

good,Workplace culture is good. Encourages you to learn. There is a lot of talented individuals to work with. A lot of turnover in the company. Workplace culture is fun but you should work hard. Increments and promotions are good
good,High pressure to work for but compensated for such.  They have had their ups and downs in the Albany area relative to leadership but have a handle on it now.  Highly focused sales organization offering training in the foodservice industry second to none

Also a typical day would have at least one prospect call as well, where I would try to work with non-Sysco accounts in order to get their business."
good,"Great job Great benefits. Very hard work. Balancing work life is also very difficult, because of the hours you work. Manage is also somewhat a problem when you have to ask for things you should have."
good,"This a company that is meant for each driver to work, 80% of the time is spent on the back of the truck unloading product to deliver. This a company that pays for your time but you also gotta work for them if u really want to stay.... At the end of the day ""it's work"""
good,"This was my first office job, it was a great learning experience for me. I would assist the HR manager with any tasks she needed to be done. I would make new hire packets and term packets, answer phones, take messages.  I really enjoyed working for the company everyone I worked with was friendly and helpful."
good,"If you are a self starter, can generate enthusiasm and handle all personality types this job is for you."
good,"Sysco is a great company to work for, but the job is intended for a young individual due to the laborers type of work. "
good,"Contract position.  Loved working with the controller and plant manager."

good,"Reasonable pay but HR may or may not be helpful."
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Sysco Corporation is typically a positive, encouraging environment.  Employees seem to be happy here. This is a company where there is a lot of learning and growth potential."

good,"the most enjoyable about the job was lunch and when Sysco throw a dinner and everybody come together and eat."
good,"I am a current employee of just over 10 years. Sysco Calgary is an amazing place to work. Supportive managment, competitive pay, work life balance and ongoing training and development both personally and professionally. Pay wise you start with a good salary and make more money based on your growth. You get out what you put in. I work with clients everyday and their successes are mine as well. As I said, great people, great place, great pay."
good,"This was a great company to work for when they used to be off of Carrollton Avenue......on North Cortez in New Orleans. It was a small restaurant and equipment and supply company that used to let their customers take shopping carts throughout the warehouse and choose what they wanted (on the small items), and write down the  big, heavy items that our warehouse workers would pull for them. We had the freedom and fun to work with repeat customers, and whatever we didn't have in stock, we would quote them a price and timeline to get it in. The only draw back to a small family owned business, is that the pay is also small."
good,once you learn the job it is a good job you can get ahead if you work hard try it out you have to load and unload trucks management will not be on your back alot

good,"Productive working environment , with unique challenges , and ample support . Co - workers would  jump in and help when the work load was overwhelming . The most difficult  part of the job was submitting many detailed reports in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team, building trust and knowing that the people you are working with have integrity."
good,"I currently spend most of my time in my car or in customer accounts. I am on the road 99% of my time. I start a typical day going from customer to customer, taking orders, creating solutions and introducing new ideas and products. I also spend a good part of each week prospecting new customers and building relationships. I am my customers go to person. It's my job to make their job easier, and I do that by helping them grow their business which in turn grows my business. I work with many people in many different departments at my office. I am in the field, so I am dependent on them for support. I love meeting new people, but most of all, the greatest satisfaction of my career is when I can attribute my actions to helping a customer grow their business. The most unpleasant part of my job would be the large amount of time I spend in my car in traffic, and the fact that I work 6 days a week. So I'm looking to move to inside sales or product management, where I can still feel like I am helping people grow their business, but with less drive time, but also where I can learn and grow. I've achieved high honers as a presidents club recipient, but my life has changed and I am looking to move into software and tech."
good,"The day is filled with Challenges, cross functional solutions, employee engagement was high, and I surrounded myself with excellent team members.  Mentoring through influence vs telling, working with Executive and middle management to achieve goals.  The difficult part, found in any change leadership was navigating the change management while keeping focused on the daily execution needs for our customers.  We exceeded our goals and celebrated the wins. The people, suppliers, and team members were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I started my day at 4 am daily (worked Sundays also)"
good,Very stressful most times because all time management but do-able.Had to know alot of codes. The hardest part was when our printer's went down and all we could do was wait . The most enjoyable was most the people because become like second family.
good,"A typical day at work, was a nonstop, usually makes the night go by quick. What i've learned, using data entry,swms ( RF) wear, how the food warehouse operated. Many adjustments had to be made because management was constantly changing. My co-workers were  very hard workers and easy to work with. Difficult part of the job was to shut down the swms (RF) systems at the end of the shift. Getting orders out efficiently to our customers."
good,"Good company and people, great team atmosphere, took care of employees."

good,"Poway ca is a good facility to work for. We are expected to unload 500-1200 cases within 14-16 hours and sometimes using a ramp. Our drivers make anywhere from 60,000-100,000+ depends on how much you want to work. It's hard work and the expectations are high but manageable. Management is great all the way from supervisors to managers to HR to the president. All have an open door policy. If you have a problem that can't be fixed within the company you always have local 683 to mediate. USUALLY the company will resolve problems internally. As long as you don't mind sweating I would say come work here. If you do mind working hard, McDonald's is always hiring. "

Each day I got to be a part of helping I enjoyed going out of my way to help customers and to be a team player for my coworkers.At times apathy of some of my coworkers in the warehouse made my direct coworker's and my job quite difficult. But when I and or my direct coworker and I approached management the urgency of some of the warehouse would get better. "

The management and my co-workers built a strong team that helped me succeed. The hardest part of the job was driving in bad weather conditions. I most enjoyed the people I met and learned that if you don't like everyone - you can't sell anyone.

good,"It's a cut throat business, being very honest, I'm a current employee , basically if you got what it takes to do the job , then you'll do it , but this job is not for everyone, that is why sysco compensates very well . I've had my battles in my mind to quit at times, but honestly,  it's hard to find the pay sysco gives . I'm proud to work here. If I move fast,  I'm done by noon. Overall great company   ."

I   had to manage the work flow, pay roll, incentive ,and check for errors. We was required to do coaching, retraining, and maintain warehouse cleanliness. When ever the order selector made a error, we have to research the error, count the slot, and adjust inventory. The warehouse is a production base job, which means fast pace all night. I   was also apart of the union investigation team. I   had to travel to different warehouses , to make sure the supervisor was treating each employee fair and make sure the warehouse wasn't endanger of have a union.

My first task was to make sure that all bin locations were replenished and the overstock was cleared from the end caps. Next, depending on whether were short staffed in a particular function I would rotate to fill that position, or continue on to my next task, breaking down and  putting away into locations, inventory received from various vendors. That would usually take until lunchtime.  After returning from lunch I proceeded to pull, ship and load all remaining orders to be shipped via freight or FedEx.

Everyone has their role and hard work is involved. You would always be greeted by your co/worker and exchange pleasantries. Everyone got along very well and always had something in common no matter who it was. Everyone would look out for each other no matter what ""position or department"" you were assigned. Safety was taken very seriously and everyone had an eye out for the concern and safety of their fellow co/worker, if something didn't look safe or questionable, someone would let someone know about it. And it was done with respect. The safety lady did a good job in that regards, no-nonsense cross your t's and dot your i's, square business approach! Every Friday BBQ and drinks were provided, Beef Fajitas and Sausage one Friday and Chicken Fajitas and Sausage the next, awesome! Management was easy to get along with and almost always present, but not so much as to feel like you were being watched or breathing down your neck. Very Transparent workplace where everything is laid out from pay raises, safety, investment/stock options, vacation, bonus, etc. no red tape, if you did not know or understand something, it was because you didn't ask or weren't paying attention. Overall a very fair, honest, safe workplace where hardly anybody is uptight and hard work pays off very well and is recognized."

good,"This job was a tuff one. Always moving, you can not be lazy ! Great paying job but a lot of work. If you are mentally strong this job will be a breeze."
good,"I spent 24 years at this enjoyable position.  a typical day involved 50-100 miles of travel and contact with 12-15 customers either by phone or in person.  Management was done from a distance and reasonably effective at establishing working conditions that encouraged success. I was responsible for selling all types of food-service products and collecting payment. "
good,Nice quick environment. Great pay. May have to stay long done nights. Off on weekends unless you want to work on Friday's. Which is optional for about 10 people
good,Warehouse clerk position was more than a 1 person job. Needs to be 8 hr and a part time position in the evening. 15 hour days were too much for 1 person
good,"I interned with Sysco for a year and I gained a lot in terms of professionalism. I worked with IT Purchasing Team and as time progressed, they were able to give me more responsibilities, a great exposure."
good,"I would pick orders and place them on the pallets, I used a pallet jack. The pay and benefits were awesome great hourly rate. Long hours so no time to  have a life"
good,I didn't care for this job because of the stress that it puts on a person!My co workers weren't happy do to the job demand!Which I felt made my job harder! I enjoy hard work but the people I'm surrounded. by need to be happy !!!
good,"I appreciate the co worker and management at Sysco Vancouver. They helped me in gaining more skill, executing the job smartly and fast. It was a night time shift so the only difficulty was changing your normal day scheduling to night. Besides that good place to work and really great staff who assisted me in my progress there."
good,A great place to learn and build upon your business experience. I was fortunate enough to be on a team where I was involved in process improvement projects throughout all areas of SBS. I learned a lot about the different business segments and its complexities and how each component related to one another
good,"Learning about products and people was fascinating.  It's what I liked to call using my resources.  My co-workers were great.  Most of my managers were helpful, some were not.  I learned who I could ask for help and get the best advice.  The hardest part of the job was face-to-face cold calling the same prospective customers every week.  The learning of all parts of the job was the most enjoyable."
good,"Sysco drives their employees to succeed and share in their vision to support their customers success through continuous training, setting goals and working together with management to overcome challenges in day to day work. Customers in this industry can prove to be difficult to work with and Sysco provides the tools and support to help their employees meet and exceed customer expectations."
good,"Sysco is a high demanding work place. Hard to complain about a place that offers job security, and good pay. The balance between home life, and work is the hard part. Room for growth is a real hard thing to do, because its based on seniority. Hours are long, and the work is hard. Over all it has a lot to offer in terms of money, and being able to take care of your family."
good,"The ability to work and given the opportunity to make decision without supervision. Great place to work but with the opportunity to cross train, but no much advancement opportunity."
good,"Advanced up to management with this company. Responsible for all daily operations from financial, culinary to sales. Increased catering sales by 50% while working at Dell Computer."
good,"I check all information with respect to customer needs ."
good,"Sysco Louisville was a very good company to have a career with. As a young company it allowed an unlimited amount of autonomy this allowed for creativity to address issues that may not be in all areas Sysco serviced.. As they grew my career grew as well. They had programs that recognized all employees, this made for a great team atmosphere."
good,"From the time I sit at my desk at 7:oo am I am non-stop on the go until the end of business.  Often before I realize it, I am working well over my 8 hours.  I have learned that 8 hours in a work day is simply not enough!  The management styles practiced here let each associate handle their day to day tasks with little to no input.  Management is trusting and has confidence in the associates they have placed in each role.  On the other hand, if there is an area of opportunity for an associate, management provides the proper tools for the associate to be successful.  Each team member brings different talents and strengths; together we all work very well and are always willing to assist with any task or project given.  Honestly, the only difficult part of the job is not having the opportunity for advancement.  I would like to work for a company that has opportunities for hard working associates work towards a promotable opportunity."
good,Communication between management and employees could be better.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,Won lots of local awards and national recognition's. Promoted many times but was passed over a couple. Pay and incentives good as District Manager. Had to work hard and smart. This is not a job for a sissy you have to constantly be on top of everything. Left in 2000 from Sysco Detroit to US Foods and they were a disorganized mess. I QUIT Fast. Tried private food distributors but they were mostly lackadaisical and inefficient. The grass is not greener at any other food distributor so don't get frustrated and keep working at whatever Sysco you are at.
good,in charge of educating the customers and providing fresh and new items for their menus to match their needs.
good,Company is family oriented. I have learned to manage the workload in a challenging environment due to the temperature. But even with such challenges I have been able to accomplish and exceed my goals. 
good,"Sysco is the largest non-oil-related company in Houston and you can tell upon entering their doors. They have staff working in every possible department (Except IT which was recently downsized) and several contributors who have been employed with the distributor for decades."
good,"Come in to work around 3am or 6am visit the drivers and warehouse personnel to see if they need anything. Then I start working on my HACCP, SEPP Manual, PSM Books, OSHA Programs or updating training. Work on DQF Files, or if an accident or incident happens I investigate to find out the Root Cause. I may have to go back and look at some security video. Check for update on OSHA and DOT Regulations. "
good,greta management as well as coworkers running the whole day trying to get a high percentage was the best part of the job
good,Sysco is a great company to work for all the above is true. work conditions were ideal the people were all professional I just loved working for Sysco L. A. and I still would have retired if circum -stances were different I would like to thank everyone for affording me an opportunity to get into the work force.

good,"I am currently Customer Service Rep/ AE assistant "
good,Good company great pay long hours kinda hard to have a life outside of work but that's because of the shift there's good employees there alot of team work
good,Excellent people like to stay there but ready for a something new Sysco is an interesting company to work for leaving the company will be a very hard decision
good,The only advice I offer is to study hard during your training and trust the process. Becoming to ambitious to early can and will lead to problems for both you and the customers or prospects.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"A typical day would entail reviewing files for associates who are either off work or on a restricted duty capacity due to a work related injury and following up accordingly. Some would need reminders as to appointments dates and times and others might have needed a translator or a ride to their appointments. Management was very involved in all aspects of the facility be it clerical, transportation or health management. The hardest part of the job was on call 24/7."
good,I have been at SYSCO for 2 years and love it. Great bosses and environment. The pay is good and the job is fast paced and keeps me busy. I would recommend Sysco to anyone as an employer.

good,"Great culture. Could use more advancement oppprtunities. Management helpful. Communication good. Benefits good. Overall, I recommend Sysco highly.  Great for anyone who enjoys food/restaurants and has experience in both."
good,"A great opportunity for those who are self motivated and able to manage their time wisely. The opportunity to advance within is there for those who wish it. Long days, working weekends is a given in this industry as we work to support and assist the growth of restaurants."
good,Sysco was highly competitive. You competed for routes. The bigger route you had the more money you made. There was manager advancement available to all employees. Sysco was a great company to work for.
good,"Must be able to change, and you will learn a lot if you want to learn. They provide everything for you to learn more via SIU. They hardest part of this job is the change. If you can't deal with everyday changes in processes then this company is not for you. What I enjoyed about working for Sysco is the people."
good,"Working in the pricing & agreements department made me more knowledgeable about excel and I learned a lot regarding reports, managing time and the best thing was that I learned about Macros."
good,"Sysco is a Great Company.  I have worked there for 17 years.   Great Benefits."

good,"Great job if you want to keep in shape without going to the gym. (known as ""industrial athletes"")"
good,"Working at the International Division gave me a different experience than local delivery. There are so many different languages and specifications that go into overseas shipments. Once that order is shipped there is no way to fix an error that has occurred  overnight. I also enjoy cross-training these new employees I have met. They understand the importance of there position at work and what they contribute to the Company. I have a good relationship with my boss and the HR department. The culture there is great, especially on my shift. We treat each other like family. The hardest part of the job I would say the communication between shifts. The most enjoyable part is telling your team they did a great job at the end of the week."
good,Great company to work for only disadvantage for me was that it was surrounded by toll roads and an hour and a half drive with no traffic and closer to three hours with traffic
good,"I learned how to surround myself with different race and learn how to perform my job. The hardest part of the job is working on Sundays because I wish to visit church and have a family time but I cannot do that because I work on Sundays. Other than that, Sysco is one of the best places to work."
good,"Great place to work, wonderful work culture. Supervisor's very involved with your training to help you succeed, your success is their success. Management was very much interested in staff feedback and I felt there was great communication. The people are great couldn't ask to work with a greater group of people. The monthly sales meetings are awesome they have great food and alot of important information is disseminated in a very positive way and staff that has exceeded the status quo are recognized."
good,An amazing and high paying job based on how good you work. Pulling batches at a fast pace in order to get and keep a high percentage is the key to getting money.
good,I would highly recommend working for this company. It is great pay and benefits. It is fast paced and you also have a chance to make extra money on your paycheck.
good,"Being an order selector from sysco is very challenging, this job is to build your physical abilities and carries various tasks. Its fun working here, and the job helps you to get fit."
good,"Sysco is an innovative company comprised of talented, dedicated, and ambitious individuals.  The work environment is extremely fast paced and also provides a lot of challenges and opportunities,  I started as a system programmer and had 10 different positions in my 22 years of employment.   There was never a dull moment during any given day. The most enjoyable part of my day was when I learned something new, and that happened 99% of the time.   I truly enjoyed helping people resolve complex IT issues as well.  The hardest part of my job (at first) was understanding the many facets of the business."
good,"Though Sysco has grown to become the largest foodservice distribution network in the world, we never forget our roots. Our local Sysco specialty companies and operating houses work closely with local farmers, ranchers and producers to provide our customers with the freshest products available."

good,"I have been working at Sysco for 6 months. they do have seniority. the drivers with the most years, of course get the better routes. All respect to some of these drivers who have been here 30 and 40 years straight. yes for a new hire driver the work is a little much sometimes but, once you get the hang of it you only work your tail off if you don't know how to organize your truck. if you touch something to move it out of the way to find something else at the bottom of a pallet organize what you pull off to where you don't have to touch it again until it comes off at the next stop. no one quits Sysco and that is a fact if you come here to do your job and nothing else then you will succeed. if you come here to ride the clock and play around then you're not going to last long. the work is not for the faint of heart, or the lazy but, with that being said if you can come in with a good attitude keep your mind on your work and stay away from the politics you will love this place. the weekly checks average 1500 to $2,000 a week for those who work fast and efficiently. they have excellent benefit packages. not the best of coverage but very good stock options 401K and the best life insurance policies. for the first year or two you will never drive the same truck 2 days in a row unless it's a fluke, you will never run the same Route 2 days in a row either, but after 2 years and I know this because I have multiple friends that work here and have been here for longer than 4 years the possibilities are endless.they have slot of gravy routes paying $440 a day, as long as you finish on time"
good,I have been working there going on 6 years now and it’s a great place to work with great people..the pay is great and I’m home every night and work 4 days a week unless wanting overtime..it’s physically demanding but love the job
good,I liked that you do just about everything on your own and nobody is on your back about getting things done. the scheduling was also great for me sun-thurs work and Friday and Saturday off.
good,"Open door President. interacted with all staff on a daily basis from cleaning crews, maintenance crew, drivers and reps. Ongoing training gave staff tools to do their jobs"
good,I love working here it is a wonderful place to work.. and the people here make it even better this is somewhere I could stay at for some time to come.
good,"While working for Sysco, even though it is a billion dollar company, everyone at Sysco Atlanta knew my name!  When something needed to be done we all jumped in together to make the project get done and be a success.  Our team could be asked to put a food show together, feed 500 people, or coordinate a culinary salon for a high end restaurant! Being part of the Sysco team is how daily life at work was.  They were family!"
good,"My experience with Sysco was a positive experience, in my opinion Sysco has the largest inventory and product line to offer customers. The best foodservice company in the USA."
good,"Sysco is a great company to work for hands down. This company is growing and they are looking for new talent to keep them in the lead. This is the #1 distribution company without a doubt, you can tell by the work ethnics of the employees.There are many Friday events that make the overall experience even better. I am greatful to have this employer!"
good,Good company just be ready to work hard. Be ready to work anywhere from midnight to seven in the morning. Its a great place to work but it can be tough most days
good,Heavy workload but you are paid for everything you do. Pay is through the roof and management takes care of you. Wish i wouldve started here sooner instead of wasting years rolling and selling beer. Why roll beer or soda for 45000 when you can roll food for 75000 to 100000.
good,Great company. Very hard work. Benefits are nice. Job requires you on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. You make your own hours but are required to work on Sundays. People and work environment are great.

good,"A typical is NEVER typical. Every day is different from, customer experiences, new item requests, product cutting,  to managing delivery issues and resolving product complaints.

The hardest part of this job is the hours I require of myself to be the very best for my company, my customers, and myself."
good,"In a typical day you start at 4:30am. You get to the yard, clock in, and find your truck. You have 25mins to do your pre trip inspection, get your hand trucks and anything else you need. You can have anywhere from 10-20 stops and 400-1200 cases. Depending on your truck load you can finish the day anywhere from 12:00-5:00. Some days you get off early and the next could be late.

good,My typical day at work was nothing typical. I could be imaging computers one moment or conducting training classes the next. My job required me to be flexible with my schedule and available at all times. I very much enjoyed the company i worked for as well as the managment team. The hardest part of my job was having to juggle priorities as they changed. I would frequently have to reschedule lower priority incidents in order to handle much high ones. The thing I enjoyed the most was the also the constant variety of work. I wouldn't know from one day to the next what i might be doing or whom I might be helping. This job taught me how to remain flexible with my time while also showing me the need for excellent follow up.
good,sysco works off a weekly percentage rate of 98% and i enjoyed pushing myself when i worked there to accomplish my percentage  while still working safe
good,"Picking orders for customers,you learn to be fast and accurate because no customer likes receiving a wrong order. Management will help you learn the job fast in order to serve the customer best. Its a very friendly to work with other employees,the hard part is when you are new and you are learning to be fast if you send a wrong product to a customer you feel bad but its part of learning.

good,"Great Company to work for.  Team players all the way.  Great for growth, very helpful staff.  Great upper management team"

You get free lunch from customers a lot - if you like Chinese food. Some customers are demanding. Manager installed new systems to make job easier - like scanning products. Good coworkers - willing to help each other out. There are lots of bonuses for drivers. Some overnights and weekends but home almost everyday.
good,"A day at Sysco was different everyday. It was not, as if it was the same issues all the time. I was taught a lot on managing people and getting the most out of them.
